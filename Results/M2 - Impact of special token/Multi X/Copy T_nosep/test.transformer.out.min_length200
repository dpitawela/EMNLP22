- our work is also related to the recent work on dynamic tracking of agents in environments @cite . however , we do not assume the existence of agents and populations that other agents interact with other agents , and do not address the issue of fairness. in contrast to these works , the agent ' s behavior is assumed to be known to be deterministic , and the goal is to minimize the influence of other agents in the article of @cite , which assumes that the agent has access to the other agent , while the agent knows the actions in the architecture of the agent .
- hand pose estimation has been a topic of active research in the area of artificial intelligence @cite . in robotics , the goal is to estimate the shape of an object based on the motion of the performer primarily to differentiate between different obstacles and obstacles @cite . however , there are several important differences. first , in @cite , a vr vr system is created by executing a database of robots. second , the system uses a static camera and a set of predefined flying objects. second , in our case , the object can be seen as a <unk> metric , while in @cite the system is based on articulated motions .

- there is a large body of work on vr control in the context of vr worlds @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the dorsal pathway provides a set of meanings of the visible and angular components of the performer primarily interested in the cartesian product of the micro the micro level and the angular domain , while the latter emphasizes the need to be <unk> in contrast to these studies , we focus on flexible <unk> and <unk> , which is a relatively unexplored topic , and is not the focus of this paper in this paper , we provide a detailed overview of the related work .
- there is a large body of work on simulating object manipulation in flexible environments @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are not directly applicable to our setting because they do not assume the hand movement of the object or the hand pose , and do not provide any information about the hand and the hand poses of the objects in the scene. therefore , there is no need for a large number of objects to be fitted to the input. perturbation-based method @cite uses a passive approach to estimate the hand shape and shape of the performer to find a distribution of the hand configurations with respect to the hand position and hand pose .
- there has been a long history of interest in the area of artificial intelligence , see the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in particular , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and rosenthal @cite showed that for any constant @math , one can think of a more general approach to deciding whether or not a given representation of a application , it is also possible to use a variant of a parser , where @math is an information related to what we want to perform here. however , there is no clear distinction between ours and ours : ( 1 ) we do not attempt to do so , and ( 2 ) we are interested in deciding whether a parser should be a system representation of the parser .
- there is a large body of work on grammatical planning in the context of artificial intelligence @cite . ford and <unk> @cite describe the use of princeton ' s approach for interactions with a set of units @math , and a <unk> @math . ford and <unk> @cite describe an interpretive set , where @math is the parse tree of the underlying object , @math is a sentence of @math from a set @math to @math . ford and <unk> @cite describe a system of @math <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite , which uses the <unk> rule to perform the following .
- in our work , we use wordnet as a baseline for our approach , which is similar to wordnet @cite . however , they do not have the ability to detect category relations and their labels are not required to be manually defined and automatically , and they are not suitable for our task since wordnet is a necessity for <unk> passages. recent work has also explored the problem of automatically identifying category names , such as tilebars @cite , and tilebars @cite . however , their method is limited by the number of relations , which might not be confused and misled by methods in the sense that they are based on wordnet .
- lexical concepts have been used for word sense disambiguation. for example , used collocations , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to disambiguate the senses of the senses for the ambiguous word. in @cite , a noun phrase was used for the disambiguation of the ambiguous word in a text processing context. in this work , the entries of the word are extracted from the ambiguous phrase and improve. in this paper , we compare our approach with these two methods : collocations , <unk> , and <unk> , which are used for lexical disambiguation and lexical disambiguation .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been a large amount of work on building unsupervised word features based on neural network models @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite used canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) to disambiguate words in the ambiguous word and disambiguate senses in different verbs. @cite utilized a decision-tree based approach to predict the senses of the ambiguous words of the word in the text , and used it for selecting the ambiguous sense of each word in a sequence of ambiguous words in a sentence. @cite used collocations , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
- in this paper , we propose a novel method that is similar to ours , but differs from @cite in that we do not attempt to learn a similarity metric based on the similarity of a word in the embedding space , instead of using a similarity measure to measure the similarity between a pair of words in an image. we use a similarity based method based on similarity measures and show that it is a good measure of similarity in terms of similarity and similarity in the feature space. we compare our method with @cite and show how it performs better than other methods in this work .
- in this paper , we propose a unsupervised method that is able to detect known words in ambiguities. for example , @cite proposed a method based on bootstrapping ' ' , which uses character embeddings and word embeddings to classify ambiguities. for details , we compare our method with those of @cite . in fact , we do not use unsupervised methods based on word embeddings and compare it with other methods , such as @cite and @cite . in contrast , our method does not use known definitions of word similarity , which is a generalization of yarowsky ' s algorithm to generate new words with the same class .
- there is a large body of work on learning the similarity between nouns , verbs , and adjectives , see e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in the former , the words are represented by children of a word , and the corresponding relation is referred to as . in the latter , the authors describe a language that matches a word to a word in a text , and a translation from one word to another , called . in contrast to these studies , we focus on finding the best association between words in a sentence and a single word , which is the case in mothers and <unk> .
- in this section , we briefly describe the most relevant work to this paper , and refer the reader to @cite for an overview of this field. we refer the readers to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a summary of the most important ideas of the topic and practitioner community to give a list of relevant words in a sentence , which is referred to as . the main difference between our work and theirs is that we use a similarity measure of word similarity in a document , and we use it as a feature extractor , and show that it is a feature representation of the words in the text .
- in this section , we briefly describe the related work on solely occurring words in a text , and we refer the interested reader to @cite for a more detailed overview of words related to our work. we refer to @cite and @cite for more details about the relations between words and words in the text , respectively , and in the context of word sense disambiguation , and to describe the words of interest in an image. we compare our method with those of ward ' s and r ' e nyi @cite , and compare it with those used in our experiments. the main difference is that our method is based on word sense similarity , which is a generalization of word embedding .
- predicate selection is a well studied problem in the context of predicate parsing @cite . it has been shown that it can be used for predicate proposal generation @cite . however , it is not clear how to use predicate constraints to improve the performance of predicates in human knowledge. moreover , the notion of entropy has not been explored in other contexts , e.g. , @cite @cite . however , in our case , the ate task is more complex , as it requires an appropriate number of words to be specified and illuminating , but can be hard to generalize to other types of contexts .
- there has been a number of studies on information disambiguation in natural language processing @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors applied a neural network to predict the senses of polysemy and used a decision-tree based approach to disambiguate senses of the text , while in @cite the authors used word embeddings to classify the contexts. in their work , they used word sense information as inputs to the word embeddings. in contrast , our work is the first to study the effect of word disambiguation on the comparison of word embeddings , which is , in contrast to our work , in the sense that we are interested in interactions between the meaning of interactions .
- there is a large body of work on model disambiguation in the context of indian languages @cite @cite . however , these studies are limited to the scope of disambiguation , which is not the case for disambiguation , as we consider in this paper. in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the effect of interactions in the model , and the dependence on the order of the word embeddings , and then predict the co-occurrence of noun phrase that is most likely to appear in the same contexts as in the search tag. all of these studies focus on disambiguation of the features , while we focus on interactions between different features .
- the role of contextual features has been explored in the context of machine translation @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite use the term co-occurrence statistics ( wordnet , word tags , etc. ) to measure the similarity between ambiguities. @cite and @cite use seven compositional models ( svms ) to classify the words and their corresponding arguments in a machine learning model ( e.g. , @cite ) . in contrast , our model is based on a feed-forward neural network ( rnn ) . in contrast to these previous works , we focus on the selection of the word probability of a word , which is the case for the disambiguation of different word types .
- there has been a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the authors describe the use of linguistically motivated vocabulary plans , and use a knowledge base to understand the internal states of an agent ' s internal states to the agent @cite . in contrast to our work , they focus on the computational aspects of the agent , which are not the case of a specific action of an object , rather than a translation of an action , which is the case in which a match is given. however , they do not use any information about the actions of the agent <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there has been a large amount of work on discrete hashing in the context of machine translation @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a straight-through estimator which is based on back-propagate gradients and gradient norms , and @cite developed an estimator based on reinforce algorithm for stochastic gradient descent , where @math is the expectation of the gating function. however , these methods cannot be applied to discrete hashing , as they do not have the same effect as the retrieval capacity of the generative model. moreover , none of these methods consider bernoulli hashing , which is the case when the training data is available .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in denoising and image denoising @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors present a method for image denoising , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math , and @math is a weighted sum of squared loss function. chi , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and chi , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , respectively. occasionally , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , were able to achieve better denoising performance. in this paper , we propose a new framework for denoising , which can be viewed as a special case of ssc .
- noise correction is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been extensively studied in recent years. for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a novel stacked convolutional neural network ( cnn ) architecture for noise prediction. in @cite , bessel processing is used to increase the noise ratio. meanwhile , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are proposed to learn optimal noise level for noise correction and denoising , respectively , local connections , and <unk> connections are used to recover the noise level from real images , which can be further enhanced by fast fourier transform ( fft ) . however , these methods are not applicable to noise due to the large number of noise dimensions .
- attention mechanisms have been widely applied in many nlp tasks , including machine translation @cite @cite , machine translation tasks @cite , and nlp. for example , in @cite , a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) is used for sentence encoding , and a long short-term memory ( lstm ) decoder is used to improve the performance of machine translation tasks. in this work , we use gigaword features to improve language modeling performance , and improve it by injecting <unk> convolutions into the encoder decoder , allowing the encoder to store information from the input data and output data , which is the focus of this paper .
- compression of machine learning models has been extensively studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods rely on compression and hyperparameter quantization , which can be used to implement machine-learning models , such as compression @cite @cite , binary weights @cite , and gradients @cite @cite . however , these methods are often sensitive to the number of parameters , and are susceptible to attacks such as <unk> or <unk> weights , which hinders their use in model generation @cite . in contrast to these methods , we focus on compression of model parameters , which is the focus of this paper .
- recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) have been proven to be effective in brain lesion prediction @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well in practice because they are sensitive to the number of weights or activations of the network , which is problematic for our purpose. another example is @cite , where the authors propose the use of a knowledge base to store the weights of the brain units , and then use it to train the network from scratch. however , this paper focuses on global architectures , which are not applicable for our purpose , as we do in this paper .
- there has been a lot of work on reducing the redundancy of model parameters @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on pruning the parameters or activations of the network , which is a special case of pruning @cite @cite . however , they do not address the problem of reducing the number of neurons per layer. in addition , they are not designed for specific models , such as dropout @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our proposed method is designed for efficient model pruning. moreover , our method is based on huffman coding. moreover , we show that it is possible to prune the network weights in an end-to-end manner .
- automl is a hot topic in machine learning @cite @cite . it has been shown that fully convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) can be used to improve model performance @cite @cite @cite . however , there is a large amount of work on reducing model complexity @cite @cite . in addition to model compression of deep neural networks in nlp , automl methods such as automl @cite @cite , automl @cite , which aims at reducing the accuracy of model compression , model design , and parameter reduction in model compression @cite . in contrast to these previous works , we propose a novel method to adjust the parameters of a network in a layer-wise way .
- a number of recent works have explored the use of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) for image captioning @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) is applied to reduce the number of large batches. in order to avoid overfitting , a grow-and-prune paradigm is proposed in @cite . in this paper , we focus on reducing row and column sparsity in the recurrent layer. in contrast to these works , our method is designed for compression of a single machine , and can be applied to a wide range of machine translation tasks , such as speech recognition and speech recognition .
- bert has been widely used in many nlp tasks , including nlp. for example , squad @cite , <unk> @cite , and multinli @cite @cite @cite , both of which have the same pros and cons of bert @cite @cite . however , bert is not suitable for other tasks , such as headline generation , question answering , and question. bert has become a hot research topic in recent years. it is worth pointing out that bert has better performance than other sequence-to-sequence models and has no impact on the performance of bert and its performance on tasks like headline generation and writing style transfer @cite .
- the problem of video classification has been extensively studied in the past few years , with the development of deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite . most of the works in this area are based on optical flow @cite @cite , long short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite , which is a type of pipeline for video classification @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors focus on the action recognition task in a short sequence of video frames , and fuse them into a short range of frame prediction. in order to improve the recognition speed , a cnn is trained to predict the next frame , and then predict the action label for each frame , individually. in contrast , our approach aims to leverage the motion information to improve recognition accuracy .
- a number of efficient neural network based methods have been proposed recently. depthwise separable separable convolution ( pointwise ) convolution ( xception ) proposed by <unk> al @cite uses a point-wise metric to replace the convolution with a short hash function , followed by a point-wise loss function @cite @cite @cite . in spite of the progress in efficient implementations of fully convolutional networks ( fcnns ) , such as <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are not suitable for mobile action recognition due to the lack of a clear separation between the slave and the master , instead of computing a scaling factor in the fusion center of the compressed convolution layers .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which considers the case where @math is the number of constants @math and @math are the vc-dimension of the excess risk bound. however , they do not consider the case when @math is cartesian , which is the case for the case of non-convex convex functions. note that in our case , the excess confidence bound @math for non-convex functions is @math . in contrast , our first-order upper bound on @math can be seen as an extension of the result of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , who show that there is no guarantee on @math .

- our work is also closely related to the recent work on stochastic variance minimization in non-convex optimization. in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm to determine the optimal convergence rate for a given target objective function , where @math is the variance of the target function , and @math is a measure of inexactness that can be used to determine whether or not a dc is considered in @cite . in this paper , we consider a first-order regularization family of non-convex variance minimization , where the objective function of @cite is defined as : where , the coefficients of @math are assumed to be negligible , causing the variance minimization of non-convex objective function .
- our work is also closely related to the stochastic subgradient method , which has been recently studied in the context of variance-reduced stochastic optimization @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the optimal confidence bound is obtained via the lagrange multipliers of the objective function , where @math is the stationary distribution of the target class , and @math is a measure of the entropy of the loss function. note that in @cite , we consider the case when the target domain is corrupted by noise , and we consider a more general class of non-convex optimization problems , where the goal is to minimize the sum of the cost function @math .
- our work is also closely related to the topic of navigation and navigation in robot markets. baldwin and klemperer @cite present a markov decision process ( ds ) framework to improve existence of policies for point-mass robot environments. they show that ds gives a collision-free feedback. however , they do not consider covering all possible orientations of the target state , and do not take into account global effects of safety laws , such as the one proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and @cite , both of these two systems , and the one presented here is a dynamical framework for club robot robot to facilitate rapid prototyping of dynamical systems .
- safety synthesis of system stabilization has been studied in the context of multi-agent systems @cite @cite @cite . the notion of safety was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the definition of safety for system stabilization was presented by <unk> and <unk> @cite . rosenberg and <unk> presented a safety notion that is similar to the one presented in this paper , however , is different from our work , as we do not consider safety and privacy policies that depend on the safety properties of the system that can be used to avoid <unk> conflicts and <unk> conflicts with different levels of flexibility and safety .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on <unk> @cite , which uses pole @cite to approximate the state of the state space and then uses it to decide whether a given state is reachable from a state space , and then applies it to a policy search. however , our work differs from these previous works in that it does not require safety guarantees , nor does it allow satisfactory approximations for safe policies in the presence of safe states. in contrast to these works , we focus on safe algorithms for safe policy search over a finite set of states , rather than a single controller .
- there is a long history of work on transfer learning in transfer learning @cite , few-shot learning @cite @cite , and life-long learning @cite . in particular , there has been a number of recent work on learning with temporal constraints @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies do not attempt to learn a representation that can be used to train a policy that is trained for a given task. in contrast to these studies , we focus on learning a reward function that is differentiable , while we do not have access to the policy , which is also the case for learning for tasks .
- in orb-slam @cite , orb-slam @cite is a classical vslam system. it uses an iterative loop closure algorithm to estimate the depth of a 2d image , and uses it to estimate depth values for pixels in a 3d map. however , orb-slam is sensitive to noise , making it problematic for outdoor scenes , such as road scenes and <unk> the depth information can be viewed as a special case , where the depth is the signed distance function , and loop closure can be used in a variety of applications. moreover , orb-slam has been used for monocular slam @cite and monocular localization @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to self-supervised tasks .
- in @cite , the authors use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict optical flows and predict optical flow. they use an lstm network to predict depth and camera pose. they train a cnn for camera pose estimation and depth estimation from the disparity map , and then train a feature map from the input image to a feature map. in contrast to our work , we use a self-supervised loss for camera motion estimation and camera pose estimation. our self-supervised manipulator is trained in a similar manner as @cite , but instead of just transforming the depth map into a single camera , and use it as a part of the image as input .
- depth estimation is a hot topic in computer vision and has been studied for a long time @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing methods are based on deep learning based methods , such as dso @cite and <unk> @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to train a depth map from rgb images to rgb images. <unk> al @cite used canonical mean field ( mmd ) to generate depth maps. zhu al @cite introduced a self-supervised method for depth estimation from unlabeled images. <unk> al @cite proposed <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on depth estimation from rgb images @cite . however , they do not use depth information as additional information for the training process , which is different from our work in that they use depth images as input to a loss function , whereas our method learns depth from a single image , while we use a similar loss to the loss of depth and pose estimation , we use an additional loss function that encourages us to adjust the distance between the source and target domains , and use it to encourage the exploitation of additional information .
- in the context of nlp , there has been a lot of work on sentence ranking in the semantic web @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a matching model based on word embeddings , which can be used as a preprocessing step to improve the matching precision and recall of the representation of a document , while in @cite the authors present a matching scheme based on a feed-forward neural network ( cnn ) and a deep neural network representation model ( clsm ) @cite . in this work , we use a bert as an alternative to the matching algorithm .
- word embeddings have been widely used in many nlp tasks , including part-of-speech tagging @cite @cite , dependency parsing @cite , and sentence generation @cite @cite . most of these approaches are based on word embeddings , which are typically either hand-crafted or <unk> representations @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is the first to propose transfer word embeddings for the word embeddings of the word embeddings. however , as we saw in , the use of word embeddings in the context of sentence embeddings has not been explored before in other domains , such as headline generation @cite and text generation @cite . in contrast to these previous work , we are not aware of any prior work that applies word embeddings to multilingual training .
- in @cite , the authors present a method that is based on the idea that the model is going back to the last layer in order to reduce the number of cores in a buffer. however , they do not consider the effect of cv random starts , which is not the case for memories that are not identically distributed ( iid ) . moreover , their approach is not applicable to our setting , as we do in this paper. in contrast , we consider the case where the cv is <unk> , while in @cite the authors propose a parallel implementation to solve this problem .
- there is a large body of work on computing the performance of flops based on prolog. for example , in @cite , the authors present a model that is based on the dynamic programming language , which can be used to determine the realism of the application and the resources of the program. in contrast to our work , they do not investigate the parallelism of a program , which is the focus of our work here. in @cite the aspect is that it does not take into account the fact that it is important to apply in the execution of the program , while in our case , it is not clear how to apply it to the application domain .
- strategic infrastructure dissemination has been studied extensively in the context of cognitive radio networks ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in @cite , the authors present a coupled risk management system ( <unk> ) for cognitive security management in financial systems. a supervisory signal model ( shocks ) for application security management was proposed in @cite . in this paper , we focus on dynamic risk management in risk management systems where the network is interconnected through risk and reserves the top layers of the network after which the network reaches a certain threshold and the remaining nodes are connected to the network of the principal component analysis ( pca ) .
- the problem of spam detection has been extensively studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the output of the participant , which is defined as a set of important descriptions of the user. however , most of the existing work on spam detection is based on heuristic rules , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and sent2vec @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose a new technique for deceiving misinformation in the context of operandi , which can be used to improve the performance of nlg systems using recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a method that is based on an email camera. they use an email user ' s history and then use it to analyze the content of the email and its history. they show that their realization is very distant than ours , as it is not surprising that their approach is not suitable for the study of the effect of the style on the number of wanted element detectors , which had not been confused and <unk> however , they do not investigate the possibility of investigating the style of the system .
- the majority of existing work on email detection focuses on detecting phishing victims. such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite are among the first ones to detect phishing detection. however , they do not detect phishing accounts in the wild ( <unk> ) , which is not the focus of this paper , as we do in this work , we focus on analyzing the phishing emails published in operandi , which aims at analyzing phishing emails and their origins in the context of operandi , while @cite focuses on machine learning techniques for detecting phishing phishing detection. in contrast , our focus here is on the first type of email detection emails , which are the focus in this paper .
- in @cite , a sigfox method was proposed to facilitate the comparability of low power error rates and mean error ( 586 ) meters. the authors proposed a method to estimate the lifetime of the lpwan devices , and showed that it is possible to train a knn network , using a detailed comparison of the results presented in @cite . in addition to the results of @cite , the authors also proposed an rssi distance function based on the collected signal strength of the truth values of the collected data and the truth distance from a source to a target data bundle adjustment method. the authors claim that the results obtained in @cite do not generalize to other types of signals .

- there has been a lot of work on feature extraction. most of the studies focus on sentence classification as a sequence labeling task @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors used word embeddings to classify the sentence and sentence fragments. they used shortest paths between word embeddings and raw words as features , followed by svm classifiers , which were used as features for sentence classification. in this work , we use the bert model as a part of our model , which is a special case of multi-head attention to improve the quality of word embeddings. we also use bert as a baseline for our work .
- there is a large body of work on improving the performance of distributed computing systems , such as mapreduce @cite @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . the main difference between our work and these studies is that we do not consider the effect of load exchange between each network and the provider , which is the focus of our work , on the other hand , aims to minimize the total number of communication rounds. furthermore , we also note that there is no work that addresses the tradeoff between speed exchange cost and performance shuffle rate. in contrast , we focus on the complete setting , which seeks to minimize a total running time of shuffle parameters. in addition , the focus is on the performance impact of shuffle computing , while we consider the complete distribution of each individual network .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the performance of distributed computing schemes for distributed computing , and propose an efficient algorithm for computing the number of nodes in a distributed computing system. they show that , in spite of being able to reduce the computation complexity of jobs , it is not possible to store multiple nodes within a distributed hash join , which is also possible to minimize the sum of communication rounds. however , in our work , the performance is dependent on a single job , while in our case , jobs are distributed according to a budget of the jobs , and the execution time is proportional to the size of jobs .
- in @cite , the authors propose a framework for distributed computing , where the clusters are grouped based on their load , and the load is proportional to the size of the code. they show that the performance of their approach is significantly lower than that of @cite . however , their approach does not scale well in distributed environments , as it is not robust to shuffle size and requires a large amount of resources to be stored in a shared memory. moreover , their performance is critically dependent on the number of jobs , which is not the case of a single job per partition .
- in @cite , the authors propose a distributed percolation model for distributed computing , where each access point is assigned to a subset of the clusters , each of which has a set of observed values , and each of them is assigned by one node , and a similarity measure is used to determine whether it belongs to one another. in this paper , we focus on multiple classes of jobs that are distributed in a single round , which is the case of our proposal. moreover , our work differs from theirs in that it focuses only on multiple nodes , and does not consider a node ' s load .
- in the context of distributed computing , there is a large body of work on the performance of distributed learning techniques for distributed computing @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors present a new approach for reducing the number of jobs that can be decomposed into a set of tasks , namely , the count , and the size of the file. meanwhile , in order to reduce the execution time of the job , the intermediate results are obtained by a reduction of the performance , such as the terasort benchmark @cite , or the <unk> benchmark @cite . however , these studies are not directly comparable to ours .

- there has been a number of studies on the influence of security in security @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use game-theoretic models to analyze the effects of viruses in a network , while in @cite the authors present an approach to security in insider and insurance systems , where the schools of a network are evolved and used to determine if a system reaches a certain goal , and to determine whether to a system should not win or not in a specific concern. finally , @cite present a similar approach to ours in terms of security and privacy in insider systems .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of a player ' s damage on a two-player game and show that it is possible to minimize the welfare of an honestly in networked insurance environments. they investigate the impact of an adverse bear on the security of the insurance system , and propose a strategy to determine whether or not a specific posture , and actively participate in an adverse affects the probability of prescribed damage on the network ' s security. however , they do not consider the security strategies and their impact on security of security on security and privacy ramifications that are fraudulent , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> are not <unk> to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work that investigates security strategies in networked security .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of fraud on the claim that fraud is misleading and misleading , they do not provide quantitative results on the credibility of a advised market , which is the focus of this paper on the influence of fraud in culture , as well as the impact of interventions on a standardized test. they show that policyholders can be used as a tool for measuring the welfare , which can be seen as a future point of view in the future , as it is not the case for a safe set of transmitters and their consequences are not identified. in fact , they are not directly applicable to our setting because the schools are <unk> and schools are shared by insurance , and <unk> .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who studied the impact of users on a network ' s intended behavior in a general way , showing that it is possible to increase damage to a user ' s damage on a contract , which can be used to determine whether a user can be changed or not. however , they did not investigate the effect of damage on the posture of a user , which is the case for a blind user to a blind story. in contrast , our work focuses on the types of security , security , and privacy aspects in a security model .
- the problem of compressed text topology has been extensively studied in the literature @cite . the main difference between our work and theirs is that we assume that we do not have access to input intervals , which is , as we do in this paper. instead , we assume the input sequence @math , which can be packed into a suffix array @math , and the index of @math is stored in the suffix array , and then the index is returned in the border of the string @math . in this paper , we use bwt based on the work of @cite , which aims at finding a @math -ary index .
- the problem of finding a input string @math has been extensively studied in the context of compressed sensing @cite @cite . however , there is no need for storing @math bits and @math for all @math . for example , in the case of @math , it is possible to use @math bits in time and space in @math preprocessing time @cite . in fact , @math is the signed distance between @math and @math , and @math is a measure of the size of the compressed document , in which @math is in the number of bits per element. moreover , @math has a space complexity of @math @cite .
- the problem of compressed text topology has been extensively studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite showed that for any @math , there exists an @math -time algorithm for @math normal space. @cite proposed a @math -time solution to this problem , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math are the number of occurrences of @math in @math . @cite proposed an algorithm that uses @math preprocessing time and @math preprocessing time. the preprocessing time is @math , and @math is a constant , and the size of the automaton. however , the running time of the algorithm is @math .
- there is a large body of work on static data structures that can be used on par with the algorithms presented in @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors show that it is possible to enumerate all possible bindings and subsumed results in the original lcp array , while in @cite the authors describe a data representation for the @math <unk> and @math , where @math is the number of vertices and @math is in the same sequence. note that in the present work , we use the @math <unk> algorithm @cite , @math , @math . in fact , @math is a subset of @math and @math .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for the problem of compressing the entire text into two parts : the first one is based on the wavelet transform and the second one , followed by the encoding and converting it into a suffix tree into a tree , eliminating the need for a list of tokens in the tree , and then dynamically determining the size of the compressed document @cite . in contrast to bwt , our approach does not rely on the fact that it is not possible to store all intervals in the suffix , which is in fact a result of our algorithms .
- compressed text indexing ( bwt ) has been extensively studied in the context of dna collections @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an index based on @math and @math , where @math is the signed distance between the input and output intervals , and @math is a @math -round index for data-intensive applications such as the one presented here. however , they do not use @math bits per suffix , which is a suboptimal tradeoff between the blowup of space and space complexity. moreover , they only use @math time and @math preprocessing time for the compressed encoding step. moreover , their space is @math .
- support vector machines ( svms ) have been proven to be effective in many applications , including search @cite , recommendation @cite , ranking @cite , search @cite and recommendation @cite . however , these methods are not applicable for search tasks , as they do not require any labeled data to train the model , which is often hard to collect in the case of search for new instances. to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on learning approaches for search for heavy-tailed items in the heavy-tail degree distributions , such as yahoo ! ! ! answers and <unk> , in this paper , we propose an approach to learn pairwise interactions between users and users .
- there is a large body of work on correction and correction of response tails and quantiles @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of noise to be stored in a new auction , which is impractical for large numbers of instances. for example , @cite adopts newton ' s method to predict the tails of quantiles and quantiles of the input data , which are rare in the distribution of the covariates and quantiles over a fraction of the sources. other recent work has focused on finding excess tails and tails of the distribution on the distribution @cite @cite . in contrast to lr and <unk> , rare instances are assigned to a single stage , which allows us to learn unbiased estimates for lr and tandem .
- there is a large body of work on image similarity prediction @cite @cite @cite . for example , oasis @cite and +1 @cite are one of the most popular and widely used methods for image search , which are based on oasis @cite . oasis @cite is the most widely used method for placing constraints on the distributions of the pairs , and thus cannot be directly applied to other tasks , such as image classification , object detection , and so on , can be viewed as a special case of oasis , which aims at finding the optimal solutions to the optimization problem , and to maximize the expected number of outcomes in each iteration .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a joint embedding network ( <unk> ) to learn similarities between sentences and their corresponding captions. in this work , the embedding space is encoded into a common embedding space , which is then used as a post-processing step to improve the retrieval accuracy. in @cite @cite , a cnn is trained to predict the embedding label of the target image , and the embedding is learned by minimizing a reconstruction loss between the source and target domains , while in @cite the authors use a siamese network to learn a mapping from one domain to another .
- image annotation has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a joint embedding network ( video-text ) for image annotation , which consists of a joint representation of videos and videos , and language-visual @cite , and <unk> @cite proposed an image embedding method to disambiguate rank lsmdc16 queries. @cite introduced a joint learning-to-rank framework for image retrieval , where the embeddings are conditioned on the neighborhood of the sentences. @cite proposed the use of a cnn for embedding images into a common space for image retrieval. however , the performance of these methods is restricted by the availability of labelled videos .
- fine-grained retrieval has been a hot topic in fine-grained retrieval @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of image descriptors to train a video classifier to predict the performance of video clips and classify the videos into different classes. @cite propose a multi-task learning approach for video retrieval , where the embeddings are extracted from a pre-trained cnn , and the output of the extractor is fed into a netvlad @cite to improve the accuracy of video modalities. in this work , the outputs of these two models are trained on multiple views , and are trained in a weakly supervised manner .

- transfer learning has been explored for the task of video captioning , where the granularity of the input space is close to the target space @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use transfer learning to the action space for the action recognition task , in which the granularity is shared across the views , and the goal is to learn fine-grained pos representations of the epic and apple dataset , which contains fine-grained pos tags , and then predicts the quality of each action in the image. we propose a novel multi-modal zero-shot learning method that is able to detect the activities and activities in the wild .
- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . the fluids , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and outflow @cite , <unk> @cite , or sco of finite differences between fates and <unk> however , these studies do not address the evolution of grid-based systems , where the <unk> of fates has been successfully used for chemistry refinement , e.g. , by @cite @cite . however , the <unk> of thin bipolar systems is limited to mass and bandwidth availability , and is typically ignored by other machine learning tools such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .

- the use of volume synchronization on parallel accelerators has been explored in the context of model performance approaches @cite @cite @cite . in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite have proposed a set of gpu-accelerated architectures for reducing the performance of the multipole method ( <unk> ) @cite , and <unk> @cite . <unk> and cilk have been the first method to recognize the weights of clusters in parallel with the structure of the tree @cite . in contrast to our work , the <unk> method is designed for complex libraries , such as starpu , and <unk> however , the main focus of this paper is on the scope of the present work .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the training of cnns for semantic segmentation. @cite proposed a generative adversarial network ( gan ) to train a generator network and a discriminator network to distinguish between real and fake examples. @cite proposed dcgan to learn the spatial relationship between the image and the output image. @cite introduced a conditional adversarial network to train dcnn for spleen shape. @cite investigated the role of adversarial training in medical image segmentation. @cite introduced the use of adversarial networks to train cnns for medical image segmentation .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on semantic segmentation @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose to use adversarial training to train the network to predict the label of the image , which is similar to our work. however , we use the adversarial loss as a baseline for our training objective , and use it as a loss function to encourage correct label consistency. in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the clues to improve the segmentation accuracy , and is designed to be more robust to noise. moreover , our method is more general , and can only handle one of the wrong classes .
- adversarial examples are vulnerable to ml attacks @cite @cite @cite . in the case of black stickers , deep ml models have been validated on the imagenet dataset @cite . in the absence of ml attacks , researchers tried to craft adversarial examples to fool deep neural networks @cite . in the context of attacking machine learning models , vulnerability to adversarial examples was highlighted in @cite . in this paper , we propose an adversarial model that can learn adversarial examples from the victim model , which can fool the dnn model with a clean dataset , which consists of 16 hours , each of which has a larger impact on the misclassification rate .
- a number of methods have been proposed for dynamic networks , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . these methods are based on a change-point detection method , while they do not consider the change-point of the detection in dynamic networks. in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the change-point , which is much more robust to change-point detection compared to dynamic networks. moreover , in our method , we propose a change-point method to estimate the graphon by adjusting the average of the average over all possible matrices , and then estimate the average probability of each node in a change-point .
- a number of methods have been proposed for dynamic networks , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . all these methods are based on a single change-point , whereas they are sensitive to the number of degrees of freedom in estimating the detection accuracy. in contrast , our goal is to develop a change-point estimation method for dynamic networks. we use lyapunov methods to estimate the detection accuracy and detection accuracy in dynamic networks. our method is different from these methods in that it does not require any prior knowledge about the change-point of the change-point .
- 3d cnns have been widely used for action recognition in recent years. the kinetics dataset @cite contains @math million videos per image. it contains @math images per pixel of size @math , where @math is the size of the video clip , and @math is as-is into the <unk> dataset @cite . the <unk> dataset @cite is the first large dataset for video processing which consists of 11 classes : kinetics. it is a large dataset that contains @math input clips and @math objects in the image. this dataset contains @math motion clips containing @math pixels in the image , @math , @math and @math . this dataset has a large gap in performance gap compared to other datasets .
- class activation maps ( cam ) @cite @cite are the most widely used method for explaining the class-discriminative attention maps , such as resnet @cite , gradcam @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . these methods are based on the insight that the input of the network should be as-is into the input , and the output of the output is a key component of the input image that is as-is into a similar family of discriminative techniques @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a new technique for injecting discriminative decisions into the inputs to a cnn , which enables a broader view of tasks .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which proposed a model for generating a new set of samples as-is into a set of disadvantage of this approach. however , they didn ' t use any information about the input and output of the model. in contrast , our method is based on the idea of injecting extra information into the training process , which is similar to the one proposed in @cite . in contrast to these works , our model aims to learn a discriminative representation in the medical domain , while in our model , the proposed method does not rely on the fact that the output of our model is as-is into the latent space .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite . in this paper , we propose a model that is based on the decomposition of the input image and the output of our model , which is similar to the one presented here , but differs from @cite in that we do not have access to the input data , whereas @cite uses a discriminative model for the task of generating a new representation for the input image. we use a similar model for association in @cite , which uses a gating mechanism for storing and decode it into a common latent vector space .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a 3d architecture for image models. they proposed the inflated 2d architecture ( i3d ) , which is a multiplicative approximation for the class activation of cnns , and was able to localize a small number of cnns in a large number of layers. in contrast to these works , we focus on explaining the input and output of the cnn , rather than explaining how a network reaches a certain threshold in a given network , while in our case the class is as-is into a broader class of models that have been proposed before .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) have been widely used for music generation @cite @cite @cite . in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in the field of music generation and generation of new harmonizations for musical material. <unk> and <unk> @cite use restricted boltzmann machines ( rbm ) to model a user ' s hidden state and a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) as a decoder for music generation. deepbach @cite is a deep recurrent neural model that is trained on audio and video data , and learns a representation for the audio and audio domain. deepbach @cite uses coupled recurrent networks ( lstm ) for sequence generation , which allows the model to generalize sheets to audio .
- continual learning ( <unk> ) is a technique that has been applied to many learning tasks , including machine translation @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite . however , it is difficult to train due to the large number of training samples and learning abilities of each new task , and thus may lead to significant reduction in the training process , especially when dealing with large amounts of data. as a result , episodic learning has been proposed to address catastrophic forgetting @cite . in this paper , we propose a continual learning method to learn the continual relationship between different tasks .
- previous work on continual learning has fallen into three groups : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> @cite is the first attempt to address catastrophic forgetting by using previously published tasks. icarl presents a similar approach to <unk> @cite , which uses a long short-term memory ( lstm ) to reduce the number of tasks. icarl stores the importance of each subset in the training set to learn a smaller set of tasks. this is a round-robin approach that performs well on small datasets and achieves a state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks .

- there is a large body of work on full-view estimation @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the problem of finding the optimal room layout for each class , which is a generalization of our proposed method , however , is different from our method in that it does not require any prior knowledge about the room or the target forms , which requires that all panorama meshes are close to each other. our method is more general than theirs in that we use 2d images instead of only one line of work , but instead relies on the fact that room labels are available at all .
- aerodynamic and ceiling have been proposed for robotic tracking. @cite proposed a method for detecting robotic manipulators. <unk> and <unk> @cite presented a method that estimates the ceiling based on the visual and motion of contacts in aerodynamic and non-rigid servoing @cite @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed <unk> , a method based on 3d and 3d and ceiling , which is used to estimate the dynamics of aerodynamic and contact dynamics of contacts and their orientations are used to improve the performance of aerodynamic effects on aerodynamic effects @cite . however , these methods do not address the challenges of <unk> and <unk> , which are not suitable for aerodynamic contact dynamics .

- person re-id has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a domain self-training method ( <unk> ) for domain adaptation. learning-to-rank ( <unk> ) @cite and <unk> ( cyclegan ) @cite are proposed to learn the feature space and camera parameters jointly. in contrast to these methods , we propose a network structure to integrate feature representation and style information into domain adaptation framework in this paper , we optimizes the changeable model and changeable , which is also a form of cross-domain loss ( <unk> ) , and propose an incremental method to integrate local feature points into the model .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , person detection @cite , pedestrian detection @cite @cite and pedestrian convergence. in particular , in @cite , the re-id task is formulated as a regression problem , where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target domains and the target domain. in this work , we use label-free data to train a model for person re-id. in addition , we propose an unsupervised self-training based self-training method to solve the problem of domain label-free data , and propose a triplet-based strategy to train the re-id model. moreover , we show that the proposed re-id model outperforms all existing re-id methods .
- there is a large body of work on paraphrasing and sentence classification , which aims at predicting a sentence from a sentence given a sentence ( usually a sentence ) . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to train a sentence metric based on a bag-of-words ( cbow ) and a sentence representation ( <unk> ) . in this work , we use rnns as the encoder decoder , and apply it to lstm decoder steps , which is an encoder and decoder , where the encoder output word embeddings are shared. the main difference is that our work is in that we focus on the latter two types .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed an unsupervised metric learning metric for natural language processing tasks. however , they did not use any pre-trained word embeddings to train a model for natural language. in contrast , we use a one-hot vector representation for each word , and use it as input to a word vector , which can be used to train our metric extractor on a large dataset , which is the case for our dataset , as it contains pairs of pairs of words , and captions , which are the case of natural language text .

- in the context of dna data , the use of multi-scale representations has been shown to be useful for the visualization of data @cite . however , the focus of this paper is not on the visualization domain , but rather on the design of a general-purpose visualization tool for visualization , which is also the focus on the understanding of what is thinking ' ' . in contrast , we aim at finding the correct scale of the molecule , rather than simply taking into account the fact that the molecule scale should be <unk> in contrast to these works , we focus on a more detailed presentation of the dna .

- the dynamics of a dna is a well studied problem in the context of dna computing @cite . most of these techniques are based on heuristic rules , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . these are not designed for the visualization of dna levels. however , the focus of these works is on the scope of this paper , which is different from our work .
- the use of multi-scale visualization has been explored in the context of artificial intelligence @cite . however , the focus of the present work is on the visualization of the dna and its command , which is not the case for a long time interval. the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite is probably the most relevant work to ours in the sense that they use scale-dependent specificity and specificity control mechanisms. they show that the resulting dataset can be used to improve the quality of the dataset , as well as the number of tasks. however , as we saw in the introduction , there is no need for a large number of valid data levels .
- meta-learning in meta-learning has been studied extensively in the context of reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , this has been applied to few-shot tracking @cite @cite , and has been shown to be beneficial for few-shot image classification @cite @cite . however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that investigates the updating of adaptive optimization methods to predict the training set , and does not use adaptive learning mechanisms to adapt to model variations in the training set. in this paper , we propose a generic learning optimizer that has been proven to be powerful enough to train our optimizer .
- in recent years , deep learning has been revolutionizing the computer vision community. for example , skipnet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , etc. these methods are all based on pruning and removing unimportant parameters. in contrast , our method is designed for low-capacity neural networks , which is more general and can be used for low-capacity networks. moreover , we propose a novel pruning method for improving dynamic capacity of deep networks , in order to reduce the computation complexity of neural networks .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a definition of feature selection techniques for multi-label feature extractions and tweets , which is similar to our definition of <unk> they used computer-generated data sets to train a machine learning classifier that is trained on a plurality of labelled data , and trained a classifier on a large dataset of @math million samples from a set of @math samples , where @math is the number of samples in the reader , @math , @math is a vector of size @math of @math . the score function @math is defined as @math where @math and @math are the label values of @math .
- there is a large body of work on label testing in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a model that is based on dirichlet allocation ( lda ) , which aims to find multi-label labels which are then used to improve label recall at classification at the same time , while in @cite the authors present an algorithm to solve the problem of multi-label classification in the context of scene visualization. however , they do not consider the effect of semantic correlations between channels and channels , which is not the case for multi-label classification. moreover , the work in @cite does not address the issue of semantic testing for real-world data .
- <unk> @cite is a seq2seq model for dialogue tasks , which consists of a set of manually defined features , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. it is trained to detect influential events. however , it is not suitable for the evaluation of symptom testing due to the large number of modalities and the absence of ground truth labels for each data point , and hence limits its application to other tasks. moreover , tcm is based on a combination of the two goals : ( 1 ) <unk> and <unk> ( 2 ) <unk> . in contrast , we do not rely on the <unk> toolkit to extract features from china , and ( 3 ) the tcm prescription of the tcm task is <unk> .
- in recent years , there has been a number of studies on the activity recognition and understanding of the camera wearer ' s movement @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a method to predict the gaze behavior of each third-person third-person third-person camera wearer by using a hmm. however , they assumed that each third-person image can be taken into account in the wild ' ' ' @cite @cite . in @cite @cite , a <unk> approach was proposed to estimate the direction of preferences in videos. @cite proposed a 3d model to predict gaze behavior in first person cameras , where the goal is to predict whether a person is taken in the first frame , and then used a convolutional neural network to predict the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the person re-id problem has been extensively studied since the early days of person re-id @cite @cite @cite . for example , the problem of person naming is formulated as a classification problem , where @math is the label of the person , and @math are the number of subjects in the person with the same subject. in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical feature learning method , named lomo + xqda , to improve the performance of object detection in top-view video , which is based on a local feature extractor , and then a local descriptor is used to match those of those views. in @cite @cite , it is proposed to learn a ridge regression model , where each human is assumed to belong to the same person. in this work , we propose a novel different-view metric based on the human body color , which can be used for wearable cameras .
- zero-shot learning ( zsl ) aims at selecting a set of unseen classes from new classes , which can be considered as a generalization of the seen classes in the training set @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel method based on the kronecker product space ( <unk> ) @cite , which aims to learn a common latent variable for a specific class and the attribute space , which is a special case of our proposed method , where the unseen class is a linear combination of both the textual and semantic subspaces , and the corresponding attribute space is defined as where @math and @math are the identity of the class. in addition , we use a bilinear compatibility function to encourage the linearity of the distribution .
- zsl has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning techniques @cite @cite @cite . in particular , zsl has become a hot research topic in the area of zero-shot learning @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the more general problem , which aims at finding the optimal set of pseudo labels for unseen classes , and propose a generative adversarial network ( gan ) to learn the semantic relationship between seen classes and unseen classes in a semantic space , which can be applied to a wide range of applications , including object recognition , attribute recognition , and semantic segmentation .
- conditional gan ( cgan ) @cite is one of the most widely used methods for image synthesis and image generation tasks. it uses a conditional gan to generate realistic images , and the discriminator is trained to distinguish real samples from real samples drawn from real data distribution , which can fool the discriminator. the generator is trained in a minimax game , which is trained by an expert trained on real data , while the discriminator tries to distinguish test samples in real samples , and thus can be used to train the generator directly. however , there is no guarantee that the generated samples are blurry , as the training data is hard to train , as it does not require any additional training data .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision , with the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite . the fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite is a convolutional neural network , which consists of a convolutional network , and a long short-term memory ( lstm ) , which is trained to predict the semantic label of the image , and then predicts the label label for each pixel. note , however , there is a large body of work on semantic segmentation , such as urban scenes , road scenes , and objects , which are not detected and ignored .
- gan has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including face recognition @cite @cite @cite , face frontalization @cite , and expression generation @cite @cite . gan has also been applied to many applications , including expression recognition @cite , frontal view synthesis @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have been widely used for image generation tasks. gans have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite , image inpainting @cite , person super-resolution @cite , and image-to-image translation @cite @cite . generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite is the first attempt to learn a mapping from a source domain to a target domain. in this work , we propose the use of adversarial access to the output of the generator to fool the discriminator. the generator is trained on a single image and a discriminator is trained to distinguish whether a sample is generated from the background. in contrast , we focus on the generation of a lifelong neural network .
- knowledge distillation has been a hot topic in machine learning and machine translation @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use a conditional random field ( gan ) to train a classifier to predict the label of a game , which can be used as a classifier for generation tasks such as image classification @cite , image captioning @cite and image generation @cite . instead of using a feedforward neural network , we use a similar training strategy as in @cite , where the training set is encoded as a loss function in the loss function and the output of a classifier is optimized to minimize the loss between the source and target domains .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep learning research. it has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite , object detection @cite , and image generation @cite . however , most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , which have difficulties in converging to a clean pictures in the form of conditional random fields ( crf ) . in contrast to our work , we do not attempt to incrementally learn the continual relationship between the original and generated classes , and propose a lifelong learning algorithm for generation .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular and successful applications in many computer vision tasks , such as image generation @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and fashion generation @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our task since we do not need to train a generator to predict the logits of the input data , and thus we use it as a decoder to train our models for continual learning. moreover , our work is inspired by the recent work by @cite , who proposed a conditional gan ( cgan ) that generates a set of images from a given input image and a discriminator network .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , which are trained in an end-to-end manner , and are typically trained in a supervised manner to obtain a clean dataset from the object class. after that , the output of the image is classified as a histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) , histogram of gradients , haar-like features , along with the features extracted from the image , and then fed them into a classifier to classify the objects. in this work , we use the selective search @cite to improve the performance of two-stage detectors .
- overfeat @cite is one of the first one-stage object detectors based on the ssd @cite and r-fcn @cite , which are based on default boxes and <unk> each channel is classified as a set of candidates , and a binary classifier is trained to predict the class label of interest. yolo @cite and yolo @cite are regression-based one-stage , and are designed for background subtraction and class-imbalance detection , respectively. as far as we know , there is no prior work that treats the class imbalance problem as a multi-class classification problem , we propose to use nesterov ' s smoothing method in @cite and @cite . however , as we show in section , it is important to note that our one-stage approach does not require any prior knowledge about the class or background .
- in this paper , we propose a novel autoregressive model that is able to capture both audio and visual notes , and exhibits a powerful and powerful representation power in the comunicacio @cite . however , the contributions of this work are different. first , instead of using raw data , we use a temporal model to capture the temporal information , which is not suitable for timbre and translation . second , our model is based on the use of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) . second , we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in a more general way. second , the model is trained entirely in a way .
- el al @cite present a method for image detection in cluttered scenes. they use a cascade of convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) to detect and track objects in the image. their detector is based on a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier , which is trained on the <unk> coplanar pairs of images , such as <unk> , multi-probe object detection , etc. their performance is critically affected by the accuracy of their method , as they do not take into account the fact that they are not <unk> in contrast , our detector is designed specifically for <unk> imaging , and is designed for <unk> imaging .
- el al @cite present a method for object detection and segmentation. they use a single region proposal network ( rpn ) to predict the label of a object in a single image. their approach is based on classifying region proposals in an image , and uses it as input to a classifier. their method is based solely on convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , and takes as input an image as input , and output regions of interest to classify objects. finally , <unk> al @cite propose a method based on r-cnn , called yolo , that is trained on imagenet , with the goal of achieving real-time performance .
- in el salvador , the authors propose a method to detect solar solar solar outdoors @cite . they propose a technique that modulates solar intensity for each pixel based on solar reflection , and use it to determine if it is going to happen in the center of interest in the image @cite . they propose an approach based on <unk> @cite . they use solar crossing damages to the hessian of the hessian matrix , which can be used for image enhancement @cite . however , they are not sensitive to camera defect detection due to the fact that they have no effect on solar panel detection .
- existing work on dynamic light field reconstruction can be broadly categorized into two classes : ( 1 ) rule-based , and ( 2 ) learning-based approaches @cite @cite @cite . ( 3 ) regression-based approaches , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite @cite and <unk> @cite , have been proposed to estimate the refractive distance from the sensor node and perform 4d spatiotemporal prediction. the cl is one of the most popular approaches for wide-baseline deformation detection is the work of @cite who proposed a system that uses 4d light field data from the center of view , with the goal of creating a correspondence vector from the depth map extracted from the rgbd camera. however , these methods require the availability of a large number of viewpoints and dramatic light of the scene .
- video segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the assumption that the foreground and background are close to each other , and the goal is to estimate the scene from the background. the main difference between our approach and these methods is that we are interested in estimating the scene structure of the scene , and we do not impose any restriction on camera geometry or lighting conditions , which is the case in our case , as we do in this paper. in the case of video reconstruction , reconstruction estimation of 3d video from complex scenes is a well-explored problem .
- temporal reconstruction of multiple points has been a topic of active research for a long time , with a wide range of applications ranging from machine learning @cite , image retrieval @cite , and stereo retrieval @cite . in general , there has been significant interest in using machine learning techniques to track multiple points @cite @cite @cite . these techniques have been shown to be effective in segmenting multiple cities @cite @cite and stereo matching @cite . however , these methods require a large number of viewpoints to be stored in a complex environment , making it difficult to scale to large environments with large amounts of data .
- a number of methods have been proposed for free-viewpoint video-based segmentation @cite @cite @cite . these methods rely on the assumption that each pixel in the image is contained in the vicinity of the image , and then estimate the shape of the object with respect to each other , or to track the other objects. in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the scene , nor does it in a way that it performs well on other objects , such as cars , pedestrians , and cars , and pedestrians in a <unk> manner. our approach is similar in spirit to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a joint estimation of both optical and optical flow in a fully automatic manner .
- in contrast to these methods , our method is based on a data-driven approach to estimate correspondence between indoor and outdoor environments @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying geometry or topology of the outdoor and outdoor scenes , which requires a large number of viewpoints to be available at the same time , and requires large amounts of training data to track the motion of the objects. moreover , a large amount of annotated data is available to track and track objects that are occluded by the motion capture data , which can be prohibitive when the number of frames is large .
- scene reconstruction is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a popular topic in recent years. it has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including scene segmentation @cite , object detection @cite , and autonomous driving @cite . scene understanding has received a lot of attention in recent years due to the availability of large amounts of training data , which is often hard to collect in real-world environments , as it is often difficult to train and requires lots of training samples per training examples per training set , and the number of samples per image is often large , making the reconstruction of the scenes from the beginning and end of the self-driving cars .
- there has been a large amount of work on adt , for example , @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not require any prior knowledge about the genus , and use a marker to track the genus of the background. @cite , the authors present a joint refinement approach based on the camera evolution of inconsistencies and coherence , while @cite rely on a <unk> descriptor to estimate genus coherence in a <unk> interest-point based approach , such as bilayer segmentation minimization @cite , or bilayer estimation techniques @cite . however , none of these works are focused on analyzing dynamic textures .
- video reconstruction has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite , computer vision , and robotics @cite @cite . most of these works focus on reconstruction of movable objects , such as background , location , size , and viewpoint. in contrast , our goal is to estimate the scene structure from multiple viewpoints , and then predict to localize objects in an image in the scene @cite @cite . in contrast to video reconstruction , video reconstruction requires only one image per pixel , which can be post-processed to obtain dynamic correspondence matching @cite @cite . video segmentation has also been explored in the past @cite @cite .
- free-viewpoint correspondence estimation of multiple images is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. it is important to note that there is a vast literature on free-viewpoint scene reconstruction from multiple images , including with a camera image of interest ( see @cite for a review ) . in @cite , the authors proposed the use of 4d normals to estimate the shape of an object and projected onto an image plane , and then used it to predict the shape from an image. however , they did not use any information about the regions in the image , nor did they use a post-processing step to improve the accuracy of segmentation .
- there is a large body of work on decentralized hash functions. for example , @cite introduced the concept of locality sensitive hashing ( lsh ) , which is based on the fact that the label of each label is a subset of all other instances , which can be seen as a generalization of the hash function. @cite proposed a hash function , called , that is , @math , where @math , @math and @math are defined as @math . in contrast , our goal is to protect against any peer , while in @cite , we focus on autonomous driving , while @cite showed that it is possible to mitigate the bias in the label .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) based model for sentiment classification. they use a cnn to predict the sentiment of a document. @cite propose a gated recurrent unit ( gru ) for sentiment analysis on the imdb dataset , which consists of 16 hours threads. the model in @cite predicts the sentiment label of the document , and uses it to train a grading teacher. @cite uses attention to improve the sentiment score of the user. however , the model is only suitable for sentiment analysis. instead of just considering the sentiment information , it is unclear whether the model can generalize well to other products .
- attention mechanism was first proposed by @cite for sentiment analysis on machine translation tasks. they showed that attention mechanism can be used to improve the accuracy of the model , but did not address the issue of sentiment generation on the sentiment of the text or text , which is a key factor for our proposed approach , however , is not designed for products where parts of the sentiment are not considered in the sentence and the phrases are remained unchanged for the reasons that are not dealt with by the attention mechanism in the context of sentiment classification , and thus is not applicable to products where phrases are different .
- a number of models have been proposed to improve the performance of ctc-based sentiment prediction. @cite proposed a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for sentiment processing , where each word is represented as a fixed-length vector , and the output sequence is treated as a sequence of words in the sequence. @cite proposed an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model to solve the problem of sentiment generation and proposed a bidirectional lstm model that is able to capture the linguistic characteristics of the sentiment and tense of a program. they showed that the model achieves a better performance than dae , but also improves the accuracy of the model .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a neural network system to learn a sentiment classifier to disentangle the positive and negative polarity of the attribute-independent from the original text , and their model is trained on the screen of the source language. in contrast to @cite , our model is designed for short reviews of products and answers , which is different from our work in that it aims at training a sentence encoder and decoder for sentiment generation on short reviews , but it is not suitable for sentiment analysis. moreover , we propose a novel numerical method to learn the adversarial phrases in the target sentence in an end-to-end manner .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on neural networks @cite @cite . in particular , our scheme is based on the intuition that a dnn should be able to predict the correct output of the classifier. in contrast to these works , we do not use any sort of gradient information , and use it as an alternative to the gradient norm of the loss function , which is useful for our purpose. we also use a similar idea to the one presented here , but use a different loss function to encourage the forward- and <unk> moreover , we use a <unk> scheme to normalize the gradients of the training set , and show that it performs better at training time .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on machine learning , where the neural network is trained to predict the label of the training set , and the output of the network is a large number of training samples per class. this is an important part of our work , as it can be seen as an alternative to neural network , which has been shown to be better in terms of models trained on imagenet @cite . however , we believe that our work can also be understood as an extension of our neural network that can deal with high-dimensional data , as we saw in .
- proposed the use of active learning for object recognition , where the goal is to predict the label of a given data , and then use it to improve the performance of the classifier. the proposed scheme is similar to ours in that it uses a large number of examples per training set , and uses it to train a classifier that is trained on the data set , while in contrast to @cite , we do not use any information about the data in the data , while we use the information from the training set to the classifier. moreover , we are interested in the selection process , which is the focus of this paper .
- different from these works , we propose to use a large number of training examples to train models that are trained on data pulled from the data ( i.e. , training data ) . in contrast to our work , we use an ensemble of classifiers that can be trained in an end-to-end manner , and evaluate the performance of these models in an unsupervised manner , which can be seen as a special case of our proposed ranking model. moreover , we show that our approach can also be used for data augmentation , such as imagenet , and <unk> , which is the case of imagenet .
- our work is also closely related to that of @cite , where the authors propose a method to learn a large dataset that can be used for models that are trained on a dataset similar to ours. however , they focus on datasets that are not available for training data , which is not the case in our case , as we do in this paper. in fact , we do not have access to datasets that have a different class of classes , and thus do not use any findings about the cifar-10 and svhn datasets , but they are not directly applicable to our setting .
- adagrad is a technique that balances the sum of the learning rate and the learning rate. it has been widely used in machine translation @cite @cite , and has been shown to be effective in apparatus @cite @cite . however , it is important to note that in adam , the hyperparameters of each layer are dependent on the number of nonzero columns , which is problematic in practice because of the exponential growth of the dimension of the model. moreover , adam has the advantage that the randomness in the learning algorithm increases significantly , making the choice of the parameter @math . moreover , it does not scale well for adaptivity .
- there is a large body of work on context-aware deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , deep features have been used to generate 3d features for image generation @cite @cite . in @cite , a cnn was used to extract 3d features from image regions , and then used a cnn to predict the next 3d word in image regions and used it for human pose estimation @cite . in @cite the authors proposed a new framework for estimating human pose from single-view images , where the model is trained on a real dataset , and the model consists of 16 hours of the training set , and a large number of synthetic images are used for scene understanding .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite are the first to propose generative models that are able to generate realistic images , but they are notoriously difficult to train , especially for shapes with large variations @cite @cite @cite . generative models have been proposed for volumetric input data , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our model is designed for single-view 3d data , and the goal is to learn a low-dimensional representation of the object , and to reconstruct the object of interest .
- there is a large body of work on reconstruction of 3d objects from single-view images @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose to use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to capture the 3d structure of the vehicle , which is trained to predict the object of interest in the slam system. however , in our work , we focus on reconstruction from single-view 3d data , and propose a novel loss function that is used for reconstruction and reconstruction of the legs , such as depth , lighting , and viewpoint change. moreover , our method is more general , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the object , nor does it require additional annotations .
- multi-view reconstruction has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods use 3d convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn to predict class label distribution from 2d images , and then use it to predict category label distribution alignment. @cite use 3d cnn as a 3d cnn for 3d object recognition , and use it as a decoder for 3d reconstruction from 2d images. @cite propose to use 3d shapenets for 3d category recognition and 3d cnn approaches for 3d segmentation. the main difference of these works is that they do not use any 3d representation , whereas our proposed framework is more general and easier to integrate into multi-view learning .
- there is a large body of work on community detection in social networks @cite @cite @cite . most of these approaches are based on heuristic rules , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , they are not suitable for dynamic networks. in contrast , we focus on dynamic community detection , which aims to partition tiles in the time domain , in addition to the number of nodes in the network , which is the case for dynamic graphs. in addition , our work is the first to investigate community detection approaches in time-varying networks .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method to predict the time-evolving strength of a change-point in social networks based on social networks. they proposed a bayesian framework to predict time-evolving strength from social networks , which can be used to estimate the birth and death of protein communities. moreover , the detection of coarse-grained community detection is based on the observation that all community members are equally important for the detection task , as it is important to understand the relationship between community structures and social networks. moreover , their method is not applicable to our setting , as we saw in the introduction , which is the focus of our work .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular methods for person reid @cite @cite @cite . gans have been successfully applied to person re-id @cite , person reidentification @cite , reid @cite , and person transfer @cite . in particular , cyclegan @cite is proposed to solve the person re-id problem by learning a mapping from images to the target domain. in contrast to these methods , we propose a novel framework to integrate generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite and cyclegan @cite . the main difference is that our re-id framework is designed for natural images , which is more flexible and easy to implement .
- attacks on adversarial examples can be broadly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) adversarial attacks @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) fast gradient sign method ( fgsm ) @cite , which aims at imitating adversarial examples and ( 3 ) fast adversarial training @cite @cite . the fgsm method @cite uses adversarial examples to strengthen adversarial examples , which fool the original image to a clean image and applies it to the optimisation of the adversarial examples. ( 4 ) deconvolution @cite generates adversarial examples with the original input image , and generates clean image from a clean image. ( c ) <unk> @cite proposes an adversarial glasses ' ' , which can be regarded as a special case of adversarial training , where the adversarial examples are added to the original images , and is trained to confuse the discriminator in a domain-adversarial training paradigm .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who proposed a framework for semantic segmentation of objects in the image. they used computer-generated data sets to train a model for image classification , where the adjacency matrix is defined as the sum of distances between the images and the center of mass. they also proposed a similar approach to ours , but did not consider cleaning up the whole image into a single image. however , their approach is not suitable for medical images , as we do in this paper , we use a more general model for our purpose .
- in the context of deep learning , the probability of a given mr image is typically defined as a set of mr images , where @math is the signed distance between a query image and a query image. the method of @cite is based on the notion of winner-takes-all ' ' ' , which has been shown to be useful for maneuver detection @cite . however , there has been no study on the interplay between the inner product and inner product of a certain degree of security. we refer the reader to @cite and @cite for a detailed overview of the probability and accuracy of our proposal .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a method for hematoxylin and eosin stained image segmentation using histology images. the method is based on jpeg segmentation , which is a special case of histology ct scans , and is able to increase the spectral gap of histology images , while our method does not use any sort of prior knowledge about the topological structure of the mr image , it is not suitable for our dataset since we are interested in the topological characteristics of the ct image. moreover , our approach is more general , as we saw in the introduction .
- recently , deep learning has been applied to simultaneous fitting and relative pose estimation and fitting of image patches @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a deep network based model based on the spatial pyramid matching ( <unk> ) @cite to directly learn the image homography embedding for relative homography estimation using thin-plate spline point smoothing for fitting k-means clustering. however , these methods are limited to the fitting of k-means , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , they do not use any pre-processing step in the fitting step , which requires a large amount of training data to train the network .
- in recent years , deep learning has been revolutionizing the computer vision community. for example , pointnet @cite uses a deep neural network to extract features from point clouds , and then uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to capture the contextual information. dsac @cite is a deep reinforcement learning network that is trained to predict the camera pose , and uses it as a building block. pointnet @cite is an unsupervised learning method for semantic parsing. dsac is an architecture based on a gating function for each point of the 3d point cloud , for example by summing up the values of distances between all points of the left and right hand to the left femur , with the average of the largest @math nearest neighbours in each cluster , and achieves decreased performance compared to conventional k-means based methods .
- there is a large body of work on data retrieval. for example , @cite used conditional random field ( crf ) to model the relevance of each word in a sentence , and then used it for qe to improve the performance of qe systems. the tested system @cite on a limited dataset of 50 dissolved interest points , and showed that it is possible to train a model on top of conditional random fields ( crfs ) . this method yielded promising results on several data sets @cite @cite . however , this method does not scale well for large numbers of terms. moreover , there is no clear distinction between this approach and ours .
- wikipedia has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing work on wikipedia has focused on alleviating wikipedia ' s expansion mechanism. for example , @cite proposed to use wikipedia as a source for the retrieval task. @cite used wikipedia as the source and target terms to improve the enrichment expansion quality of the original queries , and @cite proposed a technique for alleviating wikipedia expansion in the language selection problem. @cite introduced a pseudo-relevance feedback scheme for the language expansion problem , where the language extracted from the original terms and the user ' s query expansion is used to reduce the number of candidates .
- in recent years , there has been a lot of work on online hashing @cite @cite @cite , which aims at improving the performance of online hash functions by reducing the hamming distance between the source and target domains @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to online retrieval , as they do not require any discrete representation of the data , which is hard to implement in online settings. in contrast , our method is designed specifically for online hashing , where the goal is to update discrete hash functions with continuous relaxation. moreover , our proposed method is different from those of @cite @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the online hashing ( <unk> ) @cite , which is a generalization of the online discrete matrix decomposition based on the @math -norm of the data matrix @math and @math . however , it does not scale to large datasets. moreover , it is worth noting that there exists a @math matrix @math such that @math , where @math is some matrix of the elements of the matrix @math . however , there are many other methods @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite assume that the data @math contains the same similarity matrix @math . however , these methods cannot handle online data .
- the most closely related work to ours is @cite , which proposes the use of cyclic binary codes to generate binary codes for online classification. however , they are not suitable for online image retrieval , as they do not have access to the data points in the image , which hinders their use in practice. moreover , their method is not sensitive to the number of data points , and it is not suitable to online videos since the data is in fact , in our case , the data in our hash function is not directly related to the query. moreover , we propose a new hash function based on the alternating product of binary codes , which is also useful for online videos .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite are one of the most popular models for image generation tasks. gans have been successfully applied in image generation @cite @cite , image colorization @cite , expression generation @cite , etc. for example , furry can be interpreted as a mapping from the latent space to a latent space , and vice versa. recently , generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite has been used for face manipulation tasks. however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work that uses gans to generate realistic images , which is the first attempt to address this issue .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a generative model for tracking the shape of a lie group of incomplete lie groups. the model is based on histogram of covariance matrices that are invariant to the cartesian product of the manifold laplace-beltrami operator to the manifold of lie group. in this model , the covariance vectors are projected onto a subspace. in the case of riemannian manifolds , the gaussian distribution is computed as the sum of the distances of all pixels in general , and the covariance matrix is defined as where @math and @math are the covariance matrices. in the form of exponential loss , the number of positive definite values is minimized. however , the method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the manifold .
- there is a large body of work on image colorization using user input @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are not directly comparable to ours , as they do not attempt to colorization of the groups , which is the case in @cite . in @cite , the authors present a colorization of an image that is supplied by a user , and a user is able to determine the coloring of the image , while in @cite a colorization is formulated as an colorization of a video game and a colorization model that is trained to distinguish between an image and a certain period. however , this approach is not applicable to our setting .
- image colorization has been a long-standing challenge in computer vision , and has received a lot of attention recently. @cite , the authors propose a method to learn a colorization of images from an input image , and then train a regression model to predict the colorized semantic label from an image. they use a similar approach to ours , but they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the input. in contrast , our method is able to generate realistic images , which is the case in this paper , as we saw in sec. . in addition , our self-supervised network is trained in an end-to-end manner .
- this work is also closely related to the recent work on image colorization @cite , which uses an input image as input , and output a output of the output of a photograph , and then uses a regression model to predict the semantic label of the image. in contrast to our work , we focus on altering the performance of the network , which is different from our work in that they do not attempt to colorize , but rather focus on image content rather than visual content , rather than simply attach to the output image. in addition , our results are more general and can be used to train our self-supervised model .
- in @cite , the authors train a neural network for colorization of a reference image and a histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) , and train a network to colorization of an input image , which is then used as input to a controller. in contrast , our work is more general , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the system ' s output , nor does it use a model for colorization . we also show that our network can be trained in a similar manner as that of @cite , but in our case , we use an adversarial training approach to train our network .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep learning research. conditional gans have been successfully applied in image colorization @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , and colorization @cite . in this paper , we use gans to generate realistic images to generate aged versions of the colorized <unk> , and generate images to be indistinguishable from real images. we show that our model can be trained in an end-to-end manner without requiring any additional assumptions on the input and output of a gan. conditional gan ( cgan ) @cite is used as a post-processor to preserve meaningful <unk> however , our method is able to train our model directly from this work .
- video observation removal is a hot topic in computer vision. in @cite , the authors propose to remove rain streaks along with rain streaks from rain streaks to improve the performance of rain streak removal , while in @cite @cite , bessel frames are used to obtain more accurate rain masks. however , the work in @cite does not consider rain streaks removal , and it is not suitable for videos with high interpolation rate. moreover , the works in @cite are based on rain streaks layer , which is not the case when the rain streaks are close to the center in the frame layer , and the work @cite is based on sparse coding , and achieves better performance than the state-of-the-arts .
- rain streak removal is a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use recursive neural networks ( cnns ) to capture rain streaks and improve the quality of rain streaks predictions. @cite propose a attention mechanism to detect rain streaks by attending to all positions in frequency domain , while @cite propose attention to locate nearby regions , which are further classified into two groups : ( 1 ) <unk> , ( 2 ) <unk> , which is a <unk> layer , and ( 3 ) the attention map is assumed to be negligible , causing the <unk> trade-off to be achieved. ( 4 ) <unk> is proposed to minimize the number of stages required for training raindrop de-raining , which can be regarded as a special case of <unk> .
- in recent years , deep learning has achieved great success in background subtraction , optical flow , and background subtraction @cite @cite @cite . in particular , liu al @cite proposed a mapping function to lie group layer , which is optimized to minimize the loss between input and output channels , while satisfying the constraints of bounding-box regression @cite . in contrast , our work aims to directly optimize raindrop parameters , while we propose to use resnet as a baseline to guide the learning of raindrop removal , while @cite proposes to use a resnet that is robust to background clutter and occlusion. in addition , we propose a resnet architecture that combines recursive and resnet to achieve better performance .
- the problem of structural attention has been widely studied in recent years , with a wide range of applications ranging from machine translation @cite @cite @cite , graph clustering @cite , structural clustering @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- a number of methods have been proposed to improve the performance of multi-task learning @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable in multi-task learning due to the fact that the features of the feature vectors are observed in the embedding space. in this paper , we focus on hard example mining , overcoming this limitation , and propose an efficient deep neural network architecture that achieves better performance than the conventional <unk> feature aggregation. moreover , we use a quadruplet loss which is trained in an end-to-end manner . this is because of the difficulties of training and training instability , it is difficult to train .
- in @cite , the authors propose a quadruplet multitask learning ( <unk> ) for image classification , which consists of a feature extractor and a shared feature extractor for image classification. in their model , the feature extractor is trained to distinguish between the different classes. in contrast to our work , we propose a novel multi-task learning framework for image recognition , which is trained on a large dataset of samples from a large set of samples in the training set , and then fine-tune it with a small number of classes to improve the performance of subordinate detection. moreover , our model is designed for fine-grained objects , including objects , and scenes .
- multitask learning has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite , image retrieval @cite , and image generation @cite . in this paper , we focus on optimizing subordinate ' ' , which is the focus of our work on fine-grained image recognition , which aims to jointly solve the fine-grained recognition problem. we propose a quadruplet loss to capture the relevance of each feature in the feature space. besides , we propose to use a quadruplet network to learn the representations of attributes in a given feature space. we also use a <unk> method to learn fine-grained feature representations in the training set .

- a number of papers have studied robust generation for s-t uncertainty. for example , @cite studied the robustness of s-t uncertainty. @cite studied an robust version of the assignment problem , where @math is the number of items in the data , and @math is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math . more recently , @cite showed an @math regret bound on the regret of a constant factor. @cite considered a more general class of robust optimization problems , where the uncertainty of the data is bounded by @math , and showed an optimality guarantee of a given assignment with @math polynomially bounded ( see also @cite for a survey ) .
- in @cite , the authors considered the problem of finding the minimum regret of a cut in a pseudo-polynomially hierarchy. they showed that the uncertainty of the selection problem is np-hard. however , they proved the exact regret bound for the selection problem. moreover , they provided a @math -approximation algorithm for the case where @math is the number of items in the input. they proved that , for all sets @math , one obtains the largest regret bound of @math for a constant factor. moreover , their algorithm is based on the dynamic selection of the papers , which is tight in the sense that it does not depend on @math .
- <unk> @cite is a data collection tool for 4.0 , which allows users to be <unk> and <unk> it is a tool for managing <unk> it offers a support for managing <unk> , but it is limited to <unk> and <unk> it is not intended to support the development of software , nor does it provide support for the use of <unk> , but is not suitable for the tool itself. additionally , it is also a platform for <unk> and <unk> it provides a python interface for the developers who are presented in this paper. additionally , the authors provide a data center for managing <unk> and <unk> in their work , they provide a tool to evaluate the role of aspect obstacles in the programmer .
- in @cite , the authors present a data collection for two different components of the network , namely <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> . they present a system that is based on fourth , <unk> , and <unk> , to identify the activities that are relevant to the query. in contrast , our system is designed to be <unk> and can be implemented in a permissionless and industrial environment , which is the focus of this paper , in contrast to our work , we do not focus on the scope of this paper. in addition , our approach does not support the temporal evolution of the stream of trust and semantics .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system for 4.0 , 4.0 , and 4.0 , which provides principles and principles for <unk> systems. they provide principles to support the development of software , and production principles , and tools to support data integration on the web and production tools. the system is also based on scripting environments and <unk> , but does not support any health functionality. it is also important to note that there is no support for users to manage data in the wild ( <unk> ) . however , it is not intended to support fine-grained data and is not a primary focus of this work .
- automatic segmentation of medical images has been an active topic of research in the past few decades. we refer the reader to the recent surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite for an overview of deep learning schemes for medical image segmentation , see @cite for a recent overview of recent work on image segmentation and @cite . a detailed presentation of a surrogate class can be found in @cite . a comparison between a segmentation method and ours is given in @cite , where a cnn is trained to predict the label of a given manuscript image , is trained on scratch with ground-truth data obtained from scratch .
- in the semeval-2010 task 8 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , were the first to propose a named entity relation classification ( relation classification ) . in this paper , we propose a novel relation based on the nominals. ' s embedding , which is the basis for relation extraction. in addition , we use the nominals. operator to improve the performance of ner systems. in other words , it is important to extract features from both academia and industry , as well as other relation extraction methods , such as word embeddings and part-of-speech tags .
- recently , there has been a lot of work on relation classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite used convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for relation classification , followed by lstms for relation classification. @cite utilized cnn and rnn to extract frame-level features from relation scores , and then decoded them into a joint embedding space for relation extractions and tweets , respectively. @cite used canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) to predict the relation mentions. @cite proposed a rnn model , which extracts features from word embeddings and feeds them into the final output word embeddings , which are then fed into a rnn to feed the rnn into rnn into a gated recurrent unit ( gru ) .
- dynamic data analysis has been a hot topic in recent years @cite . in particular , @cite , the authors propose to use deep learning techniques for data corruption detection and attribution. in this paper , we use a deep neural network based approach to extract features from the patient ' s visual data , which is then used as a feature extractor for detection and recognition. in this work , the authors <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors developed a method for extracting different representations of medical diseases using medical imaging data. the authors proposed a k-means clustering method based on k-means clustering , which was used to classify different types of data , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as content-based information , and content-based information sources , respectively. the authors used a similar approach to ours , but they didn ' t use any sort of information as a feature extractor , which is not the case for a specific type of disease prediction. moreover , they did not use any information about the disease or the disease , nor did they use a blind synthesizer .
- a number of studies have investigated the interpretability of human diseases on in-the-wild diseases @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a deep neural network ( crs ) architecture for in-the-wild data , which consists of a set of annotated training samples from the raw waveform data , followed by a gating mechanism to capture the visual characteristics of mri data. the obscured neurodegenerative diseases are regarded as a volume of the data , and therefore are not suitable for the purpose of emotion recognition. in @cite and @cite , they proposed a model that is based on k-means clustering , which is similar to our work .
- the use of long short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite and gated recurrent unit ( gru ) @cite has been proven to be very effective for maneuver classification. however , it is not clear how the residual network can be understood as a special case of mri , which is not the case for neurodegenerative diseases , thus making it more difficult to train due to the vanishing gradient problem and the lack of a giant component . moreover , there is no study that adopts a new residual network and a gating mechanism that is trained end-to-end and robust. it is also worth mentioning that our work is also the first to apply sgld sghmc to train properly , instead of using an unmodified residual connection , as we saw in .
- the feedback in task-oriented wbc paradigm has been explored in many recent works @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require the availability of labelled data , which is impractical for real-world applications such as mechanical slope and obstacle avoidance. in contrast to these methods , we do not attempt to improve the performance of the model-based control algorithm by allowing the covariance matrix to be close to the optimal solution , which can be generalized to dynamic environments ( e.g. , by adjusting the contact covariance matrix ) . moreover , the feedback loop can be unnecessarily large and can be effectively optimized by the covariance hyperprior .
- non-maximum suppression ( nms ) has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely used for object detection @cite @cite @cite , detection @cite , and detection @cite . faster r-cnn @cite is one of the first modern object object detection systems , which can be used to detect objects in the image , and then detect objects with high probability. r-fcn @cite divides the image into two parts , forming a pool of candidate detectors and predicts the detection confidence maps at different scales. <unk> @cite uses a cascade of convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) for generating drifted detectors and <unk> boxes and <unk> orientations , and crops them in a patch-wise fashion .
- the one-stage approach is based on the ssd @cite , refinedet @cite , and retinanet @cite . these methods are based on a two-stage pipeline : first , one-stage detectors are applied on a sliding window , followed by a bottom-up sliding window approach , and then a bottom-up proposal network ( rpn ) is applied to detect the objects in a network. after that , after each keyframe , it is classified into a selective search , and cornernet @cite proposes a method to detect objects with grass , which can be further divided into two groups : state-of-the-art detectors , two-stage methods , and data-dependent ones. in spite of the great progress , these methods require large amounts of training data to be available from a large number of tasks. in contrast to these methods , we focus on the dsod and on-par .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a topic of great significance. the problem of object detection was first proposed by @cite , who proposed a method to detect objects with high confidence bounding box detections , and then used it to find candidate regions with high scores and minimal cost. this method , however , requires a large amount of labeled training data and is computationally expensive. in our work , we use a simple and effective sliding window feature selection method , which is based on the use of a sliding window approach. in our method , we show that it is a low-cost and cheap and accurate method .
- bottom-up methods @cite @cite @cite detect identity-free body parts with a pipeline , and find the keypoints from a set of joint detectors and descriptors. in contrast to these methods , our method is built on top of a one-stage object detector , which is based on the ssd @cite . in contrast , our aligned. is a typical object detection pipeline , which can be regarded as a generic detector , and can be trained in a single image with the right-most only on the whole image. moreover , the right-most on the entire image , which contains a large number of points in the image. in contrast with these approaches , our approach does not require a large amount of bounding boxes .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite . in a recent work @cite , the authors propose to use a canonical point cloud representation based on representation of the category-agnostic bounding box ( <unk> ) . in contrast to our work , they use a compositional approach that estimates the bounding box depth of the object in a semantic map. however , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the objects , which is not the case in our case , as we do. in contrast , our 43.2 ap is a top-down keypoint detection method that is based on heatmap prediction. the main difference between our work and these two approaches is that we use implicit channel information , whereas our method is able to detect objects in a bottom-up fashion .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on headline generation @cite . the authors proposed a method that uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to generate headline sequences from the natural language text input. this method is based on character embeddings and character embeddings , whereas our method uses a bi-directional lstm ( bilstm ) architecture for headline generation and headline generation , headlines. the difference is that our model is trained on word embeddings of words in the source sentence , which is different from the one used in @cite , but differs from the previous work in that we do not have access to the listener , but instead uses a fixed number of paired training examples for this task .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on over-parameterized networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work , on the other hand , does not require any knowledge of the activation distribution , which is a key factor for our footing @cite . however , the work in @cite focuses on analyzing local minima , and does not address identity vanishing gradients problem in neural networks. moreover , in @cite , the authors study the problem of designing feedforward neural networks for neural networks , and show that it is possible to substantially improve the performance of neural networks under certain conditions .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite investigate the implications of code generation and debugging for understanding search engines , searching for searching for 21 c # , and <unk> @cite investigate what bugs are asked to <unk> and <unk> @cite present a study on 235 code asked by developers who use 34 million code and <unk> code comments to improve search engines and debugging engine performance. they also present an approach to searching 60 million services to 34 continents. however , their approach is limited only limited and does not provide any information about the search facilities for searching links in source code , which is not the case for our work .
- there has been a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . @cite , the authors propose a rule-based system that automatically detects the licenses by analyzing the scope of a debian , which is a set of predefined rules , and then associates them with each other. @cite present a system for detecting inconsistent inconsistencies and mislead it to perform use. they use rule-based systems to detect inconsistent inconsistencies between code smells and their relations. @cite propose a system that generates <unk> links based on code information from comments posted on java and <unk> code , which can be used for comment generation and comment generation .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the role of code changes in software development and found that developers had a good impact on the technical debt , and noticed that code changes the software development debt visible during the code became larger. @cite proposed a catalog of 10 code comments dedicated to the future. <unk> and <unk> @cite presented a system that detects developers who removed their pr comments and then used it to determine the extent to which code smells removed from 31 comments on pascal and source-code level , while <unk> ' e et at. @cite presented an approach to detecting what bugs are removed by developers in the source code .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite conducted a study on the outcome of time series aware project aware of a set of projects , namely dead. @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , etc. they found that the majority of projects are limited to specific types of software , which are not suitable for homepages comments , but they do not address the issue of knowledge dissemination in source code. they also found that there is no need for <unk> and <unk> @cite conducted an empirical study on project-wide task impact analysis and concluded that there exists an increase in the number of casualties and injuries in disasters , which is not surprising in the scope of this study .
- in recent years , there has been a number of studies on feature verification and traceability @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on software engineering and do not attempt to understand the types of software metadata , such as source-code level , correctness , and safety , but do not investigate the effect of software requirements in analysis @cite @cite . in this work we focus on feature engineering in this paper , as we do in the next sections , and propose a language model for identifying fragile links in licenses and comments on source code. in contrast to these studies , we focus solely on the licenses and source-code level .
- in the context of digital media , there is a large body of work that has been done on adt , for example , @cite , @cite . in this work , we focus on the type i , which is , in contrast to our work , the focus of this paper is on streaming data , which has not been explored before , as it is important for our study. in addition , our focus is on static video streams , which are the main focus of our paper. in contrast , our goal is to study network popularity , while the focus is not on streaming services .
- there is a large body of work on segregation , see e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in the context of contagion , the results of @cite are largely based on lattice mechanics , which has been shown to work well in the area of cities. in particular , in the model studied in @cite , the authors analyzed the model in @cite and analyzed the rate of convergence in neural networks , and showed that it is possible to obtain a model of the class of preferences that can be used to explain the model ' s behavior. in fact , our approach is more general , as we saw in the introduction .
- to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to investigate the dynamics of segregation in the context of generalized partitioned models @cite . in particular , our work is different : ( 1 ) we are interested in finding the location of the preferences of agents , ( 2 ) we consider only the case where agents are allowed to partition their preferences , and ( 3 ) we assume that agents are guaranteed to have the same chance of being requested. moreover , we do not assume that the sn is not guaranteed to converge to an equilibrium , which is a violation of the heuristics .
- for the online clustering problem , kearns and <unk> @cite presented a @math -approximation algorithm for the @math -median problem , where @math is the number of elements in the data , and @math is a constant factor of @math . <unk> and <unk> @cite presented an @math approximation algorithm for @math -means , and obtained an @math -approximation in the euclidean space. <unk> and <unk> @cite introduced a variant of a @math -approximate metric that can be used to model the outliers that is , for example , 2006 , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied a coreset that runs in @math time .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved that for the @math -median problem , one can achieve a @math -approximation for the online k-means clustering problem in the euclidean space , where @math is the number of points in the metric space. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that for any constant @math , the constant @math can be arbitrarily close to @math if and only if @math is above a threshold. however , they also showed that @math -median with size @math necessitates @math points and @math . moreover , they showed that a @math -approximate @math -median algorithm can achieve @math -median in polynomial time .
- the model of the time-decaying stream stream model has been studied extensively in the context of the histogram equalization literature @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the time-decaying model can be viewed as a special case of a streaming model @cite @cite . the model in @cite is based on a model that can be used to estimate the maximum decay window in the spectral domain , where the aggregates are pooled into a single ordinal matrix , and all quantiles of the remaining itemsets. the strauss model @cite is a model for handling @math in the worst case , where @math is the number of bits in the data stream , and has been shown to be a coreset @cite .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular models for image generation tasks. gans consist of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math is the real data and the discriminator is trained to distinguish real and fake data from real data. gans have been used for many tasks including text-to-image generation @cite @cite , image generation @cite , and image-to-image translation @cite . pix2pix @cite is a cycle consistency loss which encourages the generated images from different views to fool the discriminator. the generator is trained in a discriminator , where the discriminator tries to distinguish whether a sample belongs to a class , while the discriminator learns a mapping from one domain to another. in contrast , our model is trained with a generator and a discriminator. the discriminator acts as a conditional distribution of the generator and discriminator .
- style transfer has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to train feed-forward neural networks to predict the style of a given image. they propose a deep neural network architecture that ulyanov and <unk> @cite , which uses perceptual loss and perceptual loss to encourage style transfer @cite . in this paper , we propose to use optimization to solve the style transfer problem , which is a generalization of our proposed network , where an encoder is a content image , and a decoder is trained in real-time. in contrast to these works , our network is trained on a pretrained network , and is trained for each method .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use a genetic algorithm ( ga ) to select a subset of operators that are used to give a final fitness function for a given number of classes. their approach is based on the idea of using a genetic fitness function ( mi ) as a measure of the fitness function in a given fitness function , which is defined as the sum of the outputs of a user. the authors claim that their method is conceptually similar to the one presented in this paper , however , they do not consider the case of a single tournament selection framework .
- there is a large body of work on analyzing the performance of tournament selection for constructive programs @cite @cite . sac is a first step to evaluate the performance in the purpose tournament selection process , which is similar to sac . however , there is no prior work on the steady-state selection of random variables in the form of genetic programming ( ssc ) @cite , which has been shown to be very useful for performance improvement. however , in our case , the fitness function is defined as a function of the number of operators , which can be used to quantify the quality of the brood into the structure of random programs .
- there is a large body of work on analyzing the evolution of random trees , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , there has been little work done on analyzing tournament selection in the context of random medial axis ( e.g. @cite @cite ) . in this work , we use tournament selection to analyze the effects of the fitness function on the selection of the parent subtree from the left and right tournament tree ( see @cite @cite for details ) . in contrast , we do not consider the more general form of tournament selection , which is the focus of the present work .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they proposed a genetic algorithm that is based on genetic algorithm ( ga ) for search. they used a similar approach to ours , but did not use the fitness function to improve the performance of their algorithm. however , their work did not consider the case of a tournament selection process , which did not address the difficulties raised by the fact that it did not have access to other operators , and did not investigate the use of a descent-based tournament selection or a large corpus of annotated data .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use a tournament selection method to select a set of positive and negative samples from the target domain , and then use it as a <unk> for the selection of relevant classes. they use an open source software for evaluating the accuracy of their method on the selection of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a method that is based on a genetic algorithm to solve the problem of finding the optimal subset of the reals , where the fitness function is defined as a function of the set of points , and a classifier is trained to determine whether a class belongs to the class or not. they propose an approach to designing a classifier that is able to predict the number of points in a document , and then apply it to a multiclass classification problem. the authors report that the performance of their method is significantly worse than that of @cite . however , their methods are not applicable to multi-class problems .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use the tournament selection method to select a subset of the size of a set of size @math , where @math is the number of terms. they use a genetic algorithm to find the best set of features that are relevant to the query. they use this method as a preprocessing step and use it as a pre-processing step to improve the performance of their algorithm. they also use tournament selection and select the most suitable subset of features , which is then used as a feature extractor for feature selection .
- novelty selection for tournament selection was pioneered by ns and <unk> @cite . the authors proposed a variant tournament selection algorithm that is able to select the most suitable samples from a genetic algorithm ( ns ) . they showed that novelty selection can be used to determine whether a given fitness function is better than pns or otherwise , the selection of negative selection was performed using two different tournament selection techniques. the first one was the first to show the second search for a genetic search algorithm ( ga ) . the second one was based on implicit selection of random variables , which was later used by <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a machine learning tool for http : <unk> , which is based on the selection of operators , and uses a genetic algorithm to find the best suited for a given data set , and then used it to decide whether a given query should be changed or not. they used a similar approach to ours in their work , however , they did not use any tournament selection method , as they did in their study , as we do in this paper , we use tournament selection and selection techniques. in this work , we focus on operators that are used in our work .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a deep neural network architecture that is trained on ibm ' s <unk> dataset. they use an api similar to ours , but their approach is different from ours in the sense that they use a similar architecture as ours , as we do in this paper , but use a different approach to learn a set of arguments and the api is not appropriate for our work , but rather on a different set of features , which is the case in our case , and differs from that of @cite . in contrast , our proposed feature extraction is based on multiple api modules .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a deep neural network architecture for converting nl sequences into a set of isolated itemsets ( itemsets , itemsets , etc. ) . they use the arguments from the arguments of the api to determine the similarity of malware. their approach is similar to ours in the sense that they use a feature vector to predict the similarity scores of malware. however , their method is limited to the case of a single api and does not rely on the arguments extracted from the api , which is not the case for a given api , and is not applicable to our case .
- malware detection has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning and deep learning techniques @cite @cite . in particular , malware detection is a promising solution for malware detection. in @cite , the authors propose a method to detect malware , focusing on detecting benign and malicious attacks , while in @cite the authors present an approach to detecting malware infections , which can be used as a feature extractor for malware classification. in contrast , our work focuses on detecting malware , which is a low-cost solution to the problem of malware detection. the main differences between these works and ours are the first to propose this approach .
- in @cite , the authors propose an unsupervised approach for generating malware signatures for malware classification. they propose a trigram model based on deep belief networks ( dbn ) , which uses rnns to model the parameters of a hidden state machine. the work in @cite is the first work that utilizes rnns to learn a compact representation of the behaviour of the run-time system. however , their approach is limited to the case where the arguments are not updated for each language , and is not applicable to other domains such as headline generation @cite . in contrast to our work , we propose a novel architecture for generating multiple malware samples .
- deep learning has been revolutionizing the world by using the deep learning techniques @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of input data to be available and require large amounts of training data , making it difficult to train and test for new applications. in contrast , our approach is more flexible and easier , as it does not rely on the training data and relies on data generated by humans. moreover , the deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) is used as a feature extractor and the extractor is trained on a dataset and the input data is passed through the network .
- there is a large body of work on incorporating stochastic optimization into stochastic optimization problems @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite shows that stochastic optimization can be used for solving predictive optimization problems , and @cite proves that robust optimization problems can be achieved using decision making , e.g. , @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a distributionally robust predictive decision set concentration framework which can be applied to machine learning problems , such as overheads and cancellation parameters , etc. however , they do not provide any guarantees on approximation performance for the optimization problem , and they are not applicable to our setting .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which considers the problem of finding higher-dimensional covariates. however , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the covariates. on the other hand , our method is more general than theirs , as we do in this paper , we focus on the more general case , which is not applicable in dynamic settings . in contrast , our approach is more general <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on incorporating relative importance scores for data applications such as content prediction @cite @cite , and life-long learning @cite . for example , in @cite , the problem is formulated as a regression problem where @math is the number of samples and @math are the set of samples in the covariates. in this paper , we focus on the more general case of regression , which is the focus of this paper and we are interested in the framework of weight concentration for dynamic learning problems in dynamic programming and machine learning problems , and we refer the readers to @cite for more details .
- in the context of self-adjusting search , a search function is used to determine the variance of the growth of the search space. in @cite , the authors propose to use an l-bfgs algorithm that is based on the expectation of the gradients of the <unk> however , they do not consider the case where the iterates come from a stationary point of view. in @cite the authors present a method for analyzing degree distributions based on <unk> , and show that it is not possible to use a deterministic algorithm for counting non-optimal regions , such as those required by the adversary. in contrast , our approach is more general and entirely relies on the fact that the optimum is not known .
- there is a large body of work on transfer learning for transfer learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on the use of a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to optimize the fitness function of a model. the most closely related work to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which considers the problem of testing an optimization problem to determine if a hessian is missing. <unk> and <unk> @cite are the first to address this issue by introducing a hessian matrix , and then they treat the problem as an optimization problem. <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are among the most popular ones that are hand. <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a <unk> algorithm that is based on an l-bfgs update rule , which is a subset of fitness function functions. <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an algorithm that computes the gradient of an optimization objective function based on a product of an objective function .
- blackbox , the training of single-objective reaction networks has been extensively studied in the context of lstm neural networks @cite @cite @cite , which has been shown to be beneficial for the task of predicting the performance of trained neural networks in a variety of control tasks , such as the one presented in this paper , has been recently applied to various tasks , including prediction of the state and action recognition @cite , and predicting the next state of an action @cite . blackbox , an agent can predict the state of the system state and its neighbors during the training process , which is governed by a goodness measure of the model , as in the case of <unk> or <unk> in addition , mechanistic models do not explicitly take into account the uncertainty of the underlying state , and use reinforcement learning techniques to determine whether a typical model is trained .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who proposed a sampling-based approach for finding paths in continuous solutions. however , their approach does not require any a-priori knowledge of the grid , nor does it address the problem of finding a feasible mapf instance with obstacles or obstacles @cite . however , they do not consider the case where the grid is fixed , and therefore cannot be directly applied to agents with different orientations and paths. moreover , our algorithm does not use any prior knowledge about the environment , and does not provide any guarantee for the mapf .
- in this paper , we propose a multi-column architecture that is trained to predict the density map. mcnn @cite is one of the first methods to extract the contextual information from an image. mcnn @cite uses a similar approach to cp-cnn @cite , which uses a scale-aware context encoder to capture the context information of an object , and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the scannet and fddb dataset @cite . however , mcnn is designed for the task of density estimation , which is not suitable for other people since it is not designed for a specific task such as the one we propose in this work .
- in the context of compressive sensing , it is important to note that in our case , the signal @math -norm is defined as @math , where @math is the @math -norm of the signal , @math is a @math -norm , and @math -norm are defined in terms of the @math norm. for example , in @cite , the authors consider @math -norm and iht -norm , which can be used to recover the signal strength from the data. however , they do not explicitly impose any restriction on @math , which is not applicable to our setting as we saw in the recent paper @cite .
- in the context of neural networks , there has been a surge of interest in the literature on models that can be used to train neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a norm-bounded perturbation to approximate the @math -norm of the loss function , while in @cite the authors present an iterative method for removing the @math norm of the outer @math -norm , as well as regularizing @math -norm parseval layer , leading to an adversarial glasses ' ' inside the original layer , as in @cite . in contrast to these works , we do not attempt to defend against defend against attacks .
- in the context of neural networks , carlini and <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed fast gradient sign method ( fgsm ) , which augments the gradients of the gradients with adversarial examples to defend against adversarial examples against adversarial attacks. attacking methods against adversarial attacks have been proposed to increase the robustness of machine learning models @cite @cite @cite and to detecting the adversarial examples @cite @cite against the notion of @math <unk> @cite introduced fast gradient adversarial gradient sign pursuit ( iht ) , where the @math is the @math -norm of the @math -th -norm , and @math -norm is defined as the product of the pixel values of the original image , and the adversarial loss is used to determine whether @math is bounded from below .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for modeling the area of rigid tube tubes based on the predictive control ( mpc ) technique. they proposed a predictive control method to control the tubes of the rigid tube and the tubes are used to estimate the tubes and the remaining tubes are generated by a predictive model predictive model. however , they did not address the issue of offline control of the tubes , due to the fact that tubes are not independent. in contrast to the above methods , our approach is more general since it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the tubes .
- in @cite , the authors presented a hashing-based high-performance platform for nvidia gbps , called storegpu , which is based on intel <unk> . the authors inquired information about the cpu and the cpu demand. the authors proposed a catalog system that consists of 16 hours per second half of the gpu , and then used it to improve the performance of systems. in this work , we focus on the high-performance platform that can be used to support the detection of the workload and data contrasting paas and <unk> however , we do not investigate the impact of a gpu on online performance analysis on online middleware platforms. in contrast , our work focuses on the design and implementation of a library that can protect against programmable gpus .
- in @cite , the authors studied the minimum sub-packetization level of @math . they showed that @math is the maximum sub-packetization levels. they considered the case of exact msr codes with @math access to @math . they also showed that for @math , one can achieve the optimal repair lower bound of @math . however , they did not consider the case where @math is a special case of @math . moreover , they proved that @math , where @math and @math denote the coordinate-wise code and @math respectively , respectively , @math , and @math , respectively. specifically , they showed the significantly lower bound for @math .
- in @cite , the layered and @math lrc codes are constructed over the @math nodes and the sub-packetization levels. the problem of reducing the sub-packetization regeneration rate is studied in @cite for the case of @math , where @math is the number of nodes in the @math -th downloading over all @math nodes , and @math are all odd cycles in the file. the sub-packetization of the msr codes is @math -competitive , which is @math . for @math , @math , the sub-packetization is @math . in @math , for all @math , all nodes are either @math or @math , or @math is @math . in our case , we assume that @math is a subset of the data structure and @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers the case of the mds code with a @math symbol @math , where @math is the number of access disks of the symbol @math and @math are the same. however , our work does not rely on the fact that @math is optimal and does not imply a lower bound on the sub-packetization levels. we also consider the case when @math is a special case of @math , which is the case for the special case when the symbol structure of @math is large and there is no lower upper bound on @math .
- in @cite , the authors construct an array of array codes that can be used to characterize the optimal repair behavior of the mds mds mds codes with the maximum downloading probability of the optimal symbol , which is the case in which all the elements of the symbol are requested. moreover , the lower bound of the sub-packetization levels. in this paper , we consider a more general class of mds codes , which are the case for all @math and @math . in addition , our work is more general and does not investigate the impact of the blocking probability , nor the number of erasures .

- in @cite , the authors consider the case of @math , where @math is the number of access points of the disk , and @math denotes the @math -th symbol , and the shamir ' s method is used as a preprocessing step to improve the decoding lower bound of @math . however , in the case when @math is a galois field , it is not possible to achieve a lower bound on the sub-packetization levels. in addition , our work is more general and more closely related to the mds codes of @cite , which can be seen as a special case of our mds codes .
- there is a large body of work on inferring the similarity of small 8-bit lstms @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are limited to the case of sparse batch multiplication , which is inadequate for training purposes. this is because it is possible to use residual blocks in an efficient way to reduce the number of filters needed to capture the locality of filters @cite @cite . we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details on tensorflow and yolo systems. we refer interested readers to the recent surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a detailed overview of resnet50 .

- this work is also closely related to the recent work on llc @cite , which uses the co-occurrence matrix to estimate the feature of a given feature vector in a feature space. however , they do not consider the locality of the feature vector , which is not suitable for other tasks such as image classification , image annotation , image retrieval , etc. in contrast , our work focuses on the feature extraction , rather than feature extraction in a single image. moreover , our objective is to train a feature extractor in a fully convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , and then train a network to predict the label of a gene in a supervised manner .
- the morse theory has been used for image-based understanding of cubical diagrams @cite @cite . however , these studies are limited to the extraction of extremal complexes , which is the focus of our work here. moreover , there are some studies that focus on how to preserve the persistence of the user , while we do not assume that the morse effect is known as scalar and importance sampling. in contrast to these studies , we assume that there is a large number of complexes that can be used in the extraction process. in contrast , our work aims at finding simplicial versions of the morse structure that we consider in this paper .

- our work is also closely related to the recent work on generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite . in contrast to these works , we use a gan to generate samples from a distribution , and train a discriminator to distinguish between real and fake samples generated from real data. we also use dcgan @cite to learn the distribution of samples in the latent space. however , unlike our work , the internal representation of the input distribution is not conditioned on the input distribution. moreover , our model can be trained in an end-to-end manner and is trained to predict the correct class label of the generated sample .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular methods for image-to-image translation. gans have been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite @cite , image translation @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite @cite . gans have also been used to generate realistic images @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for image-to-image translation because they do not have a one-to-one mapping between domains. as a result , our model is able to generate images from a domain to a given domain. in addition , our system can generate realistic image pairs and imitate the generated images .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on image classification @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we use the fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite to transfer image features from a generative adversarial network ( gan ) to a distribution of image pixels in an image. we formulate the task of image classification as a regression problem , where the output of the output is a probability distribution over all pixels in the input image. our work differs from these methods in that we do not attempt to learn the mapping from input images to the output domain. our approach is similar to the one proposed by @cite .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , which are trained on pixel-level annotations , such as bounding box annotations , bounding boxes , locations , and bounding box annotation labels. the main challenge of these works is the lack of supervision for semantic segmentation. in order to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation , @cite propose to use a generative adversarial network ( gan ) to learn segmentation masks from the ground-truth image , and then use it to predict the label of the target image .

- image-to-image translation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on synthesizing the mapping from a source domain to a target domain , while our goal is to translate the target video into a mapping from the source video to target video , while we focus on mapping from audio domain to visual domain to audio and visual recognition , which is different from our work. in contrast , our approach is based on spatial and temporal features of the target domain through an intermediate representation , which allows the mapping between the source and target domains and the target domain. in addition , spatial information has also been exploited in image-to-image translation tasks @cite @cite .
- instance detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been studied in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a weakly supervised learning method to avoid negative bags. positive bag is positive and negative if the positive positive bag contains the positive bag , then negative bag contains negative words ( bag ) from positive labels. @cite propose a method that is based on instance segmentation , and characterizes the object ' s location based on a density map. @cite propose an approach based on density estimation and instance segmentation to improve the accuracy of the classifier. @cite present a hybrid mil framework for instance detection in the context of video class detection. @cite propose to use instance similarity to suppress detection. however , they do not consider instance level information , which is unavailable for our task .
- a number of weakly supervised methods are based on support vector machine ( svm ) @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a method to estimate the visual similarity between positive and negative bags. instead of using a density function , <unk> al @cite used a pairwise ranking loss to measure the similarity between instances and positive bags. <unk> al @cite utilized a support vector machine. zhu al @cite applied a em-dd approach to learn a visual bag of words model from positive definite images , where the instances are positive and ambiguous if their instances are close in the positive bag , and then used it for instance segmentation .
- weakly supervised video labelling has been studied extensively in the context of video annotation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , an algorithm is proposed to estimate the probability of positive and negative bags. instead of using unlabeled data , @cite proposed a framework that estimates the mean and variance of positive definite images from unlabeled data. @cite proposed an approach based on an estimator based on the principle that the bag of words ( bags ) is defined as where @math is a positive bag , and @math is the number of instances in the bag , respectively , @math . in this paper , we propose to use expectation maximization ( nmf ) to learn the similarity between instances .

- the problem of object proposals has been extensively studied in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , which are trained on a large dataset of face proposals , such as fast r-cnn @cite , and faster r-cnn @cite . however , they are not suitable for the task of object detection. in contrast to our work , our method is based on a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , and is trained for the detection of objects in the image. moreover , our approach is more general than theirs , as it requires a large number of anchors to be used for training .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing object detectors are based on faster-rcnn @cite , r-fcn @cite , and retinanet @cite . the main difference of these methods is that multi-scale detection is performed by generating a region proposal followed by a post-processing step which is sub-optimal. @cite propose a feature pyramid matching network based on faster r-cnn @cite , which uses fpn @cite to detect objects in a single image. however , it is not suitable for face detection. in contrast , ms-cnn @cite and ssh @cite are proposed to detect multi-scale objects in an object , which are detected by a top-down mechanism to detect thousands of boundaries .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite study the importance of online and online online advertising advertisers and their impact on ad targeting. they conclude that there is a wide variety of estate analysis mechanisms that can be used to predict ad targeting. however , they do not address the problem of detecting targeted ads by shown. <unk> and <unk> @cite present an approach that is based on maximizing a utility score of a browser cookies , where the number of ads is the same as those used by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they find that most of these campaigns are affected by <unk> and <unk> , while they are not applicable to our setting , they are less suitable for crowdsourcing scenarios .
- <unk> , <unk> , and lowe confirmed that it was possible to achieve a better performance in terms of online blocking. however , they found that there exists a large number of valid campaigns , namely , when the number of ads is large , and that there is no representatives for all sets. in this context , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite showed that , for all cities , the radical usage can be used to evaluate the quality of service quality reports. as a result , this is the case for all users , and the ad is not the case in which all users are likely to appear in the same group as those used in our experiments. the main difference is that we do not have access to the actual data used in this paper .

- locality-sensitive hashing ( lsh ) @cite is one of the first attempts to extract audio features from melody , audio , and visual features , respectively. it is based on dimensionality reduction ( svd ) @cite @cite . however , it is not easy to implement , but it is hard to find an optimal choice for the detection of melody , which is not the case for mir task , as it is the case of short text retrieval , where each audio file is represented by a vector indexed by audio words. the main difference is that our network is designed for melody , but there is no need for a comprehensive review .
- in this paper , we propose a novel method that is similar to the one presented in @cite . this method is based on the fact that it does not require any knowledge of the melody , or for example , it is not suitable for mir tasks , as it can be seen as a generalization of the network , where the encoder is a vector of dimension @math , the output dimension of the matrix @math is the output of a matrix @math , where @math is a matrix of dimension at least @math . in contrast , our method does not need to learn anything from the data .

- in medical imaging , u-net @cite was the first to propose a network that is trained on melody and melody , but it is not clear how to parametrize the number of wanted classes in melody but also the drums @cite . u-net @cite is a symmetric convolutional neural network network that can be trained in an audio domain , and can be used to recover melody with small size @math , @math the number @math -th harmonic functions is @math , and @math is the architecture of u-net @cite , @math , which uses @math convolution , @math convolution and @math normalization , @math and @math .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been no prior work on adt extraction of features for asr systems. however , there is no previous work that uses speed perturbation as an indicator of features , such as part-of-speech tags , pos tags , chunk tags , etc. @cite have shown to be a good hint for asr systems , as well as by <unk> and <unk> ' s method , as it is quite simple. however , in the case of speed extraction , features are context-sensitive , which are not the case in the sense of the corpus , which is the case for asr system .
- there is a large body of work on quality calculations for rdf applications @cite @cite @cite . the main focus of this work is to quantify the degree of errors for the quality of the dataset , which is the focus of our work , as we do here , are interested in measuring the semantic gap between the source and the target datasets , which can be further categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) <unk> , ( 2 ) <unk> , and ( 3 ) <unk> , ( 4 ) <unk> , ( 3 , 3 ) <unk> and ( 3 <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the most relevant work to ours is @cite , which proposes a graph-based analysis framework for the last layer of sub-graph based on neo4j @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the commonly used measures of consume a large amount of data , while we do not use any measures of graph-theoretical generators. in addition , our work is a first attempt to apply a graph based analysis for foaf or foaf graphs , which has been applied to foaf graphs @cite @cite . however , as a matter of fact , there exists a large number of possible link graphs , such as neo4j @cite or <unk> @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a kernel-based approach for kernel domain adaptation , where the geodesic distance between the source and the target domain is defined as a regression problem , which is trained on the source domain to the target domain. in contrast , our approach is more flexible and easier to train than the target domains , and can be easily integrated into a deep neural network as it can be trained on a source domain and a target domain. we believe that our approach can be applied to other computer vision tasks , such as image classification and semantic segmentation .
- the problem of finding graphs in complex graphs has been studied in the context of artificial intelligence @cite . in particular , it has been shown that there exists a large body of work in the area of earthquake and its growth in the number of edges in the graph ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) . however , in the case of manipulating graphs , it is not possible to determine if one is not interested in finding the correct set of points in the graph. moreover , the distance between @math and @math is defined as @math , where @math is the minimum number of vertices in @math .
- <unk> and murray @cite studied the statistical properties of the property in the context of a sequence of betti structures , such as the geodesic distance @cite , reeb graphs @cite , and the reeb graph @cite . they showed that for any constant @math , the geodesic geodesic distance in the graph can be used to approximate the reeb graph. however , they did not investigate the effect of space complexity in the space of the graph , which is not the case for a specific class of graphs in which the distance between two graphs is bounded by o( @math ) . moreover , <unk> and <unk> showed that there exists a lower bound on the number of betti spaces @cite .
- in the context of functional structures , <unk> and <unk> @cite investigated the reeb vector machine ( svm ) and showed that it is possible to compute distances between two dimensions. <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that , for any @math , the reeb graph @math , @math can be approximated by @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . they showed that the distance between two graphs is at least @math if and only if @math is a small subset of @math . <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a distance function to measure the degree distribution in the graph , which is the case for all @math .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on unsupervised exploration of epsilon-greedy and reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . count-based exploration has a rich history of exploration , where the exploration of exploration has been an active area of active exploration @cite @cite , and has recently been applied to the domain of reinforcement learning ( rl ) @cite @cite . we refer the reader to the surveys by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for a thorough overview of the state of the art. we refer to recent surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite and <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details and more details .
- social interactions have been widely studied in the context of robotics @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) to model the social interactions between pedestrians and oncoming vehicles , and train a classifier to predict the birth and death of videos. @cite propose to model dynamic crowds as a social langevin process , where the object is visited and the destination is stationary. @cite further improve upon this work by proposing a real-time pedestrian prediction. however , these methods are not applicable to our setting because the agent moves to a stationary point and does not take into account the behavior of the object , which is not suitable for navigation. besides , our work is different from @cite and @cite .
- our work is also closely related to apprenticeship learning @cite @cite @cite , which aims to learn a posterior distribution from a given set of observations @math , where @math and @math are the set of distributions of the state @math and the distribution of each state @math , and @math is a probability distribution over a set of states @math , @math is the probability distribution of a state distribution @math that minimizes the probability of playing a distribution @math from the training set @math . apprenticeship learning has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks including markov decision processes @cite and markov random field ( mdps ) @cite .
- branchynet @cite is a subset of classifiers , which selects the most appropriate subset of proposals. this method is based on the idea that an image should be bypassed to save a high computational cost , but it is impractical for large scale deployment. the main disadvantage of these methods is that they usually require a lot of computing resources , which is sub-optimal. @cite propose a sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts rejection method , which divides the gradients into several blocks of size @math , each with a constant @math , and a smaller number of bits per unit is used as well. however , the collapse of classifiers is still a major challenge , as it requires a large number of inputs to be processed as a whole .
- in @cite , the authors propose a .41 defense scheme for inference in a aig network , which is based on the <unk> defense mechanism. convnet-aig @cite and resnet-101 @cite are two separate branches , and are complementary to our work. however , they do not address the issue of residual inference in nearly all categories. in our work , we use a <unk> approach to verify the correctness of resnet-50 , while we use the <unk> approach in @cite . in contrast , we consider a more general setting , which allows the programmer to specify which parts of the configuration are executed on the other layers. moreover , we do not require any additional knowledge about the configuration space .
- reducing the accuracy of network compression has been a topic of active research @cite @cite @cite , which has been extensively studied in the context of neural networks @cite @cite . most of these methods rely on pruning the parameters or activations of the network to remove unimportant connections from the parameters @cite @cite . reducing the number of parameters to filters in the network , increasing the relevance of each layer in a dnn , and prune it according to the weights of the model. however , these methods require a large amount of memory. in contrast , our work focuses on removing a square grid of filters , which is a key component in our approach .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the authors propose to use nesterov ' s algorithm for reducing the mode collapse problem. however , they do not consider the case when the inputs are close to the sparse inputs , and they are not bypassed to save memory. moreover , they propose an accelerated version of this method , which is based on the fact that per-layer collapse into the loss function. as a result , they use a structured sparsity constraint on @math and @math , where @math is the number of weights in the training set , and @math is bypassed to @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a stochastic gradient descent approach to reduce overfitting in neural networks. they use stochastic depth strategies to reduce the number of layers in the training phase , and use it to improve the computation efficiency of training. however , they do not consider the case when the inputs are executed , which is not the case for data flexibility. in addition , they propose an algorithm that takes @math layers as input , where @math and @math are the output of the last layer , and @math is the same as in @cite . however , their approach is not applicable to our setting .
- this work is also closely related to the recent work on recommendations. @cite proposed a ranking model based on climf @cite , which uses climf @cite as a ranking algorithm for recommendations. however , they didn ' t use any information about the user ' s and items. instead of using climf @cite and @cite , we use a ranking loss to train the ranking model. moreover , they do not consider cleaning up the ranking function into the ranking function. moreover , we propose a novel ranking model that is able to capture the correlations between implicit and implicit feedback , which is more suitable for evaluation .
- our work is also related to the recent work on spoofing resolvers @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not investigate the effect of fast quic @cite and <unk> @cite . however , their focus is on the establishment of tls quic that is based on elliptic curves , which is the focus of our work on network lookups and on dns quic @cite . however , they do not address the vulnerability of cloud lookups on a few years. moreover , they only consider a small number of floating points , and do not consider the vulnerability measurement. moreover , our work differs substantially from these prior works in that we focus on a more detailed analysis of isp quic @cite .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of denial of service attacks on the asap handshake protocol @cite . however , they do not address the impact of dns traffic on the package. moreover , our work is different from theirs in that we consider the establishment of dns quic and dns traffic , which is a key source for our work , however , we focus on the use of isp quic and quic @cite for spoofing resolvers in a distributed fashion , rather than the ip address cutting and <unk> moreover , we do not provide any prior work that uses dns quic to perform spoofing naming and ingress .
- our work is also closely related to the work done by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use dns data as a source of representatives for the rest. as a result , they use a dns proxy for the extra download rate for the client to determine if it has been requested. moreover , their method is not suitable for a specific number of dns records , and is not robust to insertion of <unk> in contrast , our approach is more general , as it is not designed to be parallelized , and can be stored in the dns with <unk> quic @cite and <unk> @cite .
- culotta and <unk> @cite proposed a method for extracting patterns from a text corpus , using a snowball ( snowball ) to measure the similarity between two tuples of a given document and a newspaper corpus of the sample. they tested their method on yin and <unk> datasets and found that it is possible to use snowball queries to perform better than other methods such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , present an approach for extracting missing facts from a newspaper text corpus from english and chinese <unk> their method is close to ours , however , they do not use any domain knowledge nor do they are able to capture the candidate facts .
- knowledge base extraction has been a hot topic in biomedical domain @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on extracting text facts from text pairs , which are either valid. for example , ollie @cite , <unk> @cite , patty @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are among the most popular approaches for extracting text features from text and text , respectively. recently , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are the first to investigate the relations between text categories and text fragments. while these methods are effective , they are limited by the number of casualties and injuries in disasters , they require a large amount of annotated training data , which limits the scope of our work .
- template matching is a classic problem in computer vision and has been researched for a long time @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the hamming distance is defined as @math where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math is a function of hamming distance. in @cite the authors proposed device-to-device ( dis ) matching based on hamming distances , which can be used to measure the distance between outliers. @cite proposed a robust matching method based on linear histograms , which is based on the hamming distance. @cite and @cite extended the work by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an inverted cross product based method to estimate the hamming distances .
- summarization is a hot topic in computer vision. it is important to measure the similarity between two images and the center of the image , which is a measure of the number of similar pairs in the image. in @cite , the authors propose a parameter-free matching method based on matching two patches , namely , @math , and @math . in this paper , we measure the overall similarity between the input component and the output of our method to detect the object of interest , and then develop a novel method for non-rigid visual data based on the similarity of pixels. however , it is not clear how to detect and change the edges in the template .
- the problem of image inpainting has been extensively studied in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite , computer vision @cite , and machine translation @cite @cite . the most common approach is to train a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that is trained to predict the next output of the classifier. this approach has been successfully applied to image recognition @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in robotics , robotics , and computer vision , and robotics communities. for the first exciting few years , there has been a great deal of interest in solving the problem of training deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite . however , they have difficulties in converging to incorrect solutions to the parameters of encoder and decoder networks , and are not applicable to our task as we do here. in contrast , our network learns a mapping from parameters to the output space , which is the case of 3d rotations. in fact , our decoder is more general , and is more robust to noise than parameters .
- a recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite is the most closely related to ours in the sense that they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying distribution , while they are not directly applicable to our setting as we do here , as we saw in the forthcoming sections of section . in comparison to these works , we focus on super-resolution and super-resolution of the interpretable class of images , which is also the focus of this paper. in contrast , our model predicts the optimal number of images of the points in the image , thereby increasing the width of the image .
- unsupervised landmark alignment methods can be roughly divided into two categories : model-based methods @cite @cite @cite and deep learning based methods @cite . in feature-based methods , the features are extracted from two images , and then fed into a classifier to classify the unconstrained objects. the detectors are then classified into three categories , namely <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in the former , the latter is trained on a single image , and the shape is estimated by the template. in @cite , the authors propose a sparse set of fiducial markers and markers on the detected objects. in the second category , the detections are used to estimate the shape and shape of the facial objects. in contrast to the methods based on deep learning , our method is more robust to unconstrained variations due to the lack of ground truth data .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including face recognition @cite @cite , face detection @cite , object detection @cite @cite @cite and face tracking @cite . in recent years , convolutional networks ( cnn ) have achieved great success in various tasks including face swapping @cite @cite . however , these methods are sensitive to illumination changes and viewpoint changes , which hinders the use of deep learning. for example , facenet @cite is a deep convolutional neural network that is trained on rgb images and requires a large amount of annotation. it is unclear whether it is possible to use a deep neural network to learn a mapping from input images to input images .
- neural networks have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , image generation @cite , style transfer @cite , etc. most of these methods are based on prior knowledge of the behaviour of the input image , which can be viewed as a form of prior knowledge transfer ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in contrast , our approach is based on deep neural networks which are trained in an end-to-end manner without sacrificing the ability to train the network , while we focus on facial expression recognition. in contrast to these methods , we propose to use a deep network which is trained to predict whether an image is an image or a facial image , while in our case , the markers are assumed to be known in advance .
- there is a large body of work on pseudo-random time analysis in the context of games. for example , @cite proposed a deep neural network that uses deep neural networks ( rnns ) for the ale environment. @cite introduced the use of multilayer perceptron ( mlp ) for distributed games and showed that it is possible to train agents on the ale @cite . they showed that the performance of dqn is significantly lower than that of the state of the art. however , they did not show that these algorithms can be fooled easily by memorizing the impression of the source , which is the case when the source and target states are small. however , there is no guarantee that the amount of impression is <unk> in contrast to these studies , we do not explicitly use a deep architecture , but rather focus on task-specific definitions .
- transfer learning has been a hot topic in computer vision and machine learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on transfer learning , which aims to transfer knowledge from one domain to another @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we propose a novel representation network that is trained on both source and target domains , and then train a classifier to predict the label of a target domain , which is the case for a new task , as we will show in section . the main differences between these works and ours are that they are designed for a specific task , and are not applicable to our task .
- unsupervised domain adaptation is a classic problem that has been studied by many researchers @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose an unsupervised method to learn the new feature representations of the source and target domains , which can be used as a post-processing step to improve graph-based representation learning. moreover , we show that it is possible to train a model that can be trained in a domain-adversarial training paradigm , which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. propose a novel domain adaptation network ( <unk> ) @cite to alleviate the difficulties of labeled training data , where labeled data are scarce. the key difference is that the triplet loss is defined as @math , where @math is the distance between source and the labeled data , and @math is a measure of the similarity between labeled and generated data .
- clustering and clustering has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the principle that the latent space should be close to the embedding space , which is the case when the data is small. however , there is a large body of work on clustering , where the mean and variance are close to each other , and the mixture components are not just the same as that of the variational auto-encoders ( vaes ) and the covariance matrix is defined as the sum of the distances between the source and target domains .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system for forum with latex <unk> they show that it is possible to improve the performance of 64 bytes in 21 bytes as a result , they do not provide any information about the content provider , but also provide a tool for a full-fledged kb passing system. however , the focus of their work is not on a specific topic , nor does it address the need for a broader range of software , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , in contrast to our work , is the first attempt to address the issue of detecting all-to-all messaging in bytes .
- in @cite , the task-based bytes interface was used to implement a ucx interface for openshmem , which is not suitable for a specific kb , but also for a <unk> stack of bytes bytes metadata regarding the network throughput. the authors envision that openshmem are not <unk> in contrast , our library does not support a <unk> library , nor does it address the need for a <unk> interface , which provides a comparison between the two threads : a <unk> interface that is <unk> , is designed to support <unk> bytes at the time of submission , a comparison is provided in tab : <unk> .
- key-value stores have also been proposed for ramcloud applications @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not designed to be suitable for a specific class of applications , such as ramcloud @cite and ramcloud @cite . in contrast to these systems , we do not rely on a library of bytes stored in a shared repository , which is problematic for latency reasons. first , our design is based on a <unk> key-value store , which allows to use bytes as a fallback for every rate of the system. second , ibdxnet provides a concise description of a library that can be used to provide a complete description of the rate .
- in @cite , the authors developed a tool for proving the security limits of definitional and eavesdropping on a random " <unk> , which is based on simulation-based dwork @cite . in particular , the results presented in @cite are more general than ours. however , in our work , we focus on the constructions of covert covert covert communication on distillation , where the forward and authentication requirement is @math and @math is the signed distance function ( @math ) . moreover , our approach does not require any message exchange between a receiver and a receiver , and a previous round of message exchange protocol .
- our work is also related to the study of deniability dake @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors developed a key authentication protocol for active messaging under the assumption that all users are allowed to access a key and perfect security. however , our work differs from @cite in that it does not rely on a trusted party and does not address the problem of achieving the optimal key in the setting of active eavesdropping and adaptive eavesdropping on a <unk> protocol. moreover , the protocol does not guarantee the existence of the forward oracle , which may not be information-theoretically generalized to one-round communication .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the security limits of the qbc protocol for a ( <unk> ) , where the optic qbc protocol is formalized , where a bit of keys can be injected into the integrity. however , the reductions presented in this paper do not consider the effect of fake key generation. moreover , the impossibility result in @cite relies on the notion of perfect security. moreover , in @cite the authors present a <unk> protocol that can enable a ( <unk> ) exchange between two candidate sets , showing that it is possible to enable a more off-the-shelf protocol than one of the above three techniques .
- our work is also closely related to the hough transform @cite , which uses hough transforms to approximate the attraction of a line map. however , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying line , nor does it need to be able to segment the objects. moreover , our lsd convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite is a state-of-the-art method for semantic detection and mapping the features into a vector space , which is a generalization of hough transform , which can be applied to the input space and to the output of a multi-layer neural network to predict the boundaries of a pixel .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on image coloring as it is the first to propose to use random hough transform @cite @cite to detect the boundaries of an image , and then use hough transform to find an optimal set of peaks @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to 2d line detection as they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying line or line boundaries , which is often hard to be generalized to other types of images , such as line search and line search @cite @cite , and line detection @cite .
- chordal tensors have been widely studied in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . for example , superimposed curves on the surface and machining @cite @cite , parametric tensors @cite and free-form tensors @cite are used for generating user-friendly control @cite . in this paper , we focus on the cutting and machining of one-by-one , and propose an efficient algorithm to finding the optimal path describing the direct area of the cutting surface. however , the guarantees are limited to smooth curves , such as machining @cite , and physics @cite @cite . in addition to these studies , we propose a new technique to finding user-friendly curves .
- in this paper , we focus on the cutting of one-by-one generated views of the interior of the cutting and smoothness. in @cite , the laplace transform is used to reduce the cutting precision of each conflict , while in @cite the laplace equation is used for finding the optimal path in machining systems. however , in @cite @cite the authors propose to use differential smoothness to solve the cutting problem. however , this method is not suitable for height systems. moreover , the method in @cite does not provide a mechanism for generating the optimal conflict curves , which is not appropriate for machining , machining and physics .
- active learning has been a hot topic in machine learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on heuristic rules , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our proposed algorithm is based on the search tree controller , which emits a new cell in the design space. in contrast to these search methods , we do not require any search for the design space , which is a strict subset of a set of cell architectures that can be executed in a single network , and hence search for new architectures .
- active learning has been used for active learning in the context of machine learning @cite . in this paper , we focus on reviewing the related work on active learning , where the goal is to learn a model from a set of structures , such as cpu , memory , and memory unit. we also note that in @cite , we do not have access to the structure of the neural network , which is the focus of this paper . in contrast , in @cite the authors propose a coresets that can be trained on a large dataset of imagenet and large datasets , which are not available on the internet .
- our work is also closely related to the work done by <unk> al @cite , who proposed a network for visual tracking. the network is trained to predict the pose of the image , and the pose is estimated from the image plane using a rough camera pose. however , this approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the scene. therefore , it is not possible to train a network on a large dataset , which is not available in the real scene. moreover , we use a sequence of rgb images to estimate the pose , and then use it as input for our approach .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a deep neural network for human pose estimation. they trained a cnn to predict the pose of a cnn. they used a similar approach to ours , but their approach is different from ours in the sense that the network is trained on a large dataset of images in order to improve the accuracy of the network , rather than using a rough initial training set , which requires a large amount of training data to be available for the training set on a new dataset , which is the case in our case .
- in @cite , the authors present a review on the visibility of 20,000 stream systems. in this work , they focus on a single type of data center , i.e. , a set of sensors , and a ue is assumed to be drawn from a distribution of trust values. in this context , the architecture of the microservice-based system is similar to ours. however , they do not address the issue of fault tolerance and do not consider the effect of inter-cell interference. in contrast , our work focuses on the use of sensors in a distributed fashion , which is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors propose a catalog of 30 web services ( <unk> ) , which is based on a time span of web design. in this work , a set of tools are used to assess the quality of service ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to evaluate the popularity of a web service. however , these approaches are not intended to be suitable for a broad range of applications. in contrast , our goal is to provide a detailed view of a user in a smart city , while in our case , in this paper , in contrast to @cite , is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors use a deep neural network ( cnn ) for image classification and audio classification. they use a cnn to extract features from a new image , and feed them into fusion layers to improve the accuracy of the classifier. they use the classification loss as a loss function , which is trained on a dataset of imagenet , and the classification accuracy is significantly lower than that of the classification margin. however , they do not use any other modalities , such as images and images , which are ignored in the training process. in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the dataset .
- in @cite , the authors propose a fusion method that is trained on a dataset of e-commerce inputs. they use a multi-modal classification network to classify each dataset into five modalities , namely , the classification loss and the classification loss. they use the softmax loss to predict the label of each dataset , which is used as a loss function for classification. in contrast to our work , they do not rely on the training data , but instead use a different loss function that is used for fusion of different modalities , such as audio and visual features , as well as training data for fusion .
- the work most closely related to ours is auto-sklearn @cite that uses mip to solve the problem of hyperopt attacks @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on the optimisation of <unk> rules in a new context , namely <unk> @cite , auto-sklearn @cite @cite is another popular machine learning system that has been applied to a wide range of problems including machine translation @cite @cite , bayesian optimization @cite , and bayesian decision tree @cite @cite . however , none of these methods are designed for new settings , such as machine translation , machine translation and machine learning , in which case the evaluation of a software system is <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on agnostic learning in the context of machine learning , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that they do not require any knowledge of the pipeline and the pipeline to be modular and do not impose any restriction on the number of time steps , which can be costly to implement in practice. moreover , we assume that all time steps are synchronized , while we are interested in the case of <unk> , which is the case for a broader class of applications , such as ad hoc observational data .
- auto-sklearn @cite is the first automl approach for agnostic learning in machine learning and machine learning in the context of machine learning , which is based on monte carlo tree search ( hyperband ) @cite , which aims at finding the optimal configuration for a given set of data points in a given dataset , and is able to decide whether or not to answer the question whether it is thinking ' or not ' , but it does not provide any guarantee on configuration space or configuration space in the dataset , nor does it discuss in detail in section , section 6.2 and section 2 of section 4 of this work .
- this work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which is the closest work to ours in the sense that they use a genetic algorithm to select the best pipeline for a given pipeline , and use a similar approach to ours , but they do not use any preprocessing step , nor do they do it in a configuration space. however , their approach is limited in the case of configuration space analysis , as it is not possible to use a pipeline similar to ours as tpot in @cite , but it is also possible to implement pipelines in a round-robin manner .
- auto-sklearn @cite is the first automl method for building machine learning systems in the context of machine learning and machine learning. it is based on monte carlo sampling , which aims to tailor a learning algorithm to a specific task. adam and adam @cite is a automl technique that has been applied successfully in machine learning , but it is limited to the configuration space and configuration space , which is not the focus of this paper , as we do in this work , we focus on configuration space exploration , rather than configuration space optimization , which can be integrated into our hyper-parameter tuning framework .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a two-stage approach for configuration optimization over a set of data points in a pipeline that is based on a shared representation of the pipeline , a pipeline for configuration , and a pipeline to determine if it is going to happen next , and if it has been applied to other domains , it is not possible to use a pipeline similar to ours as tpot by <unk> @cite , which also uses a genetic algorithm to implement algorithm for configuration recognition. however , they do not provide any guarantee for configuration construction , and they are not applicable to our setting .
- depression media has been studied extensively in the context of social media , including depression , spread , and cognitive radio networks ( e.g. , @cite ) . however , there is no study that investigates the engagement of the social media and its stock market , which is the focus of this paper , as we are aware of any other prior work that has been done in the domain of depression , which focuses on detecting and classify the different types of social signals , such as onset , etc. in contrast , our work focuses on identifying the behavioral features that are relevant to our work .
- in the context of attention systems , attention has been widely used in many fields including machine translation @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use a hierarchical attention mechanism to attend to different parts of the representation. in contrast , our model is more flexible and more robust to out-of-vocabulary items than a single one. also , we use a simple attention mechanism that uses the hierarchical structure of the attention mechanism , as well as the number of words in a sentence , which is the focus of our paper . we use the ideas from @cite to show the effectiveness and prominence of text and pos tags .
- in this paper , we propose a novel attention mechanism based on the idea of attention mechanism , namely to attend to different parts of the sentence. the mechanism is based on a set of features , such as pos tagging and dependency parsing. we show that our model can also benefit from the mechanism proposed by @cite , which uses a similar approach to @cite . however , they do not use any information about the parts of a piece of information as input. thus , we use the mechanism of @cite to normalize the weights , and weights , which is a measure of whether the features of the model. moreover , we do not require any prior knowledge about the source and target sentence .
- attention mechanism was introduced by @cite for machine translation. it was shown that attention mechanism can attend to different parts of the input sentence and improve the performance of nmt. the difference between the output and the embedding lies within a fixed-length vector , which is important for reducing the size of the sentence. however , it does not address the issue of attention mechanism in neural machine translation systems , which we propose in this paper will show in our experiments in section . in addition to @cite , we show that attention can also be used to achieve better performance in attention-based nmt systems in terms of performance .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed the use of a neural network to predict a sequence of tokens in copying tweets from social media data. they showed that it is possible to predict the results of a turing machine. however , they did not use any information about tokens and did not answer questions about why they tried their model had tried to answer questions related to sentiment. they did a similar approach to ours , but did not consider cleaning up to 16 mb of tokens , which was not the focus of this paper . in contrast , our model is more general , as it does not require any machine learning model .
- in recent years , there has been a growing interest in userspace transports due to their flexibility and ease of innovation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the ecg signal can be used as a source of data , such as physical reality , weather , weather and traffic @cite @cite . however , there is a large body of work on compression of wireless analog-to-digital converters , which is not suitable for wireless applications such as health monitoring and traffic monitoring @cite @cite . in this paper , we reduce the number of required nodes in a patient , by adjusting the placement of the body body , and propose an efficient and automatic method that enables the compression of the physical system .
- optical sensing has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely studied in the context of wireless sensor networks ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . most of these works focus on reducing the number of transmit adcs to reduce the transmit and transmit rate. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use the <unk> channel ( e.g , @cite ) to reduce increase the snr of analog analog analog images , using the elliptic curve coding ( dd ) @cite , as well as the <unk> source-channel model ( gmm ) @cite . however , the <unk> is not suitable for wireless applications .
- there is a large body of work on analog source-channel impulse source-channel compression. for example , @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite give an overview of various compression techniques , such as gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) , gaussian mixture model ( hda ) , but not suitable for analog source-channel compression. more recently , @cite have been proposed for analog broadcasting in analog channels with a spice technique. however , as far as we know , our work is concerned with analog adcs to reduce the number of analog-to-digital converters ( <unk> ) . moreover , our proposed method is based on a user ' s adcs .
- there is a large body of work on image classification in cluttered environments , including https : <unk> en <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work is the first to propose the use of toa matching for single time series recognition. in addition to mmc , we propose a classifier that is able to beat the consequences of leaves in this model. moreover , we show that it is possible to perform the task of single time warping as well as the leaves of the articulated path .
- in the context of deep learning , convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) have been widely used in image classification @cite @cite . in this work , we use a cnn to extract the features from the image , and feed the concatenation of the features extracted from the feature maps , and use a dropout technique to extract features in the feature space. we use the output of a cnn as a part of the feature extractor and show that it is possible to use a cnn. we also use an architecture that is similar to @cite , but instead of using rectified linear unit ( relu ) .
- in the context of directional access control , the authors in @cite investigate the effect of directional cell reception in millimeter-wave ( 802.11ad ) and propose a hybrid approach to estimate the optimal access rate in the presence of delayed and angular errors in the cell. however , they do not consider the bf direction in the downlink and complicates the access control decision. furthermore , the work in @cite proposes an angular allocation scheme based on free-space regions , which is based on a <unk> connection. however , all of these methods are based on the assumption that the bs is stationary , and thus cannot be applied to other scenarios .
- there is a large body of work on clustering communities in social networks @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on learning features from user-generated content , and propose a novel heuristic to optimize the quality of computer-generated links , which can be seen as a combination of matrix factorization ( <unk> ) and clustering ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we consider the problem of detecting groups that are relevant to the community detection , which is also the focus of this paper . here , we use clustering rationales to improve community detection and provide a more complete understanding of community detection .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a deep learning based method to predict users ' topics based on boltzmann machine. they proposed a model to predict the user ' s topics in the social network , which consists of predicting trust. @cite proposed an approach to model the social relationship between users and opinions , which can be used for fall detection in a similar way as in @cite . however , their method didn ' t take topics into account the temporal relationships between topics and topics , which is not suitable for community detection. in contrast , we propose a dense model that can detect users in a diverse way .
- reinforcement learning ( marl ) has been extensively studied in the context of protein game theory ( see , e.g. , @cite and references therein ) . this has led to a surge of interest in the area of artificial neural networks ( e.g. , the self-avoiding chain , or dill @cite , which connects adjacent proteins to protein sequences , can be viewed as a cubic game between the conformational space and the abstract state space. this corresponds to the setting considered in this paper. in this paper , we propose the use of reinforcement learning to obtain upper and lower bounds on the confidence chain .
- there is a large body of work on reinforcement learning for protein folding , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works are based on heuristic rules , such as the existence of a feasible set of devices , or the advantage that the structure of the conformational space can be used to evaluate the quality of a protein structure , e.g. , the degree distribution , the number of amino acid heads , the structure , and the time complexity of this algorithm is proportional to the size of a set of dimensions. in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the structure and does not impose any restriction on its energy budget .
- our work is also closely related to bilevel optimization @cite , which aims at solving a convex optimization problem , where the goal is to minimize the sum of the costs of the original objective function and the objective function of the objective function. however , in our case , we assume that @math is the set of points , @math is a set of possible actions of the problem , and we are interested in finding optimal solutions of the optimal solution set , and @math is an upper bound on @math . we also note that our method is more general , since we do not require any prior knowledge of the environment. moreover , our method does not require the computation of the gradients .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on inverse reinforcement learning ( mab ) , where the goal is to minimize the sum of the parameters of the optimization objective , and the objective function is to maximize the online objective. this setting can be seen as a generalization of the inverse problem , where @math is the number of samples in the optimization horizon , and @math can be arbitrarily large ( see @cite for details ) . in contrast to our work , we are interested in finding an optimal solution for the optimization problem , which is , in the sense that our optimization problem can be viewed as an optimization problem. we also note that in @cite , the authors propose an online algorithm for inverse reinforcement learning. in contrast , our algorithm does not depend on the parameters , and does not require online updates .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , where the authors propose to use nesterov ' s algorithm for the purpose of reversing the optimization of the optimization algorithm. however , they do not consider the case where @math is a set of values , and @math are the number of values in @math and @math . in contrast to our work , they use a momentum term in the form of momentum , which is the case for the optimization problem. moreover , we do not have access to the optimization problem , and we use it as a black box for future work .
- in our work , we propose to use the nrf sampling strategy to improve the classification efficiency of decision trees @cite . in addition to the nrf model , nrf samples are used for classification purposes , which is the main focus of this paper is the work of hermans and <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the authors propose differentiable kernels for enforcing the weight of each node to be close to each other node in the training set , while we use random weights for updating the weights and activations from the training set. our dshm differs in that it uses a stochastic gradient based classification loss , and is designed for a sparse set of neural network , which is <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- there is a large body of work on personalized genome aggregation @cite @cite @cite , which has been broadly categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) identifying important data in a set of data that is , ( 2 ) identifying the lr data and ( 3 ) finding that the optimal subset of lr data is infeasible. the first attempt to address this issue is that it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the data , or ( 3 , 3 ) identifying the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- captioning has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the grounding of the video content from the video , while we focus on reasoning about the short-term input from the logical forms , such as the video captioning model @cite @cite and the video description model @cite . in contrast , our work aims to predict the short-term action from the web , which is a more challenging task in instructional instructional movies and videos. in contrast to these works , the goal is to understanding the long and future understanding of the daily activities in videos .
- question answering has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of understanding questions from the questions and answers in videos. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a compositional approach to automatically answering questions based on the logic language model ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose a novel static model based on recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , which is trained to predict the next answer in the question and the answer. in contrast , we focus on logical reasoning in instructional instructional instructional questions and actions in the wild .
- visual attention models pay attention to visual attention to the image captioning task @cite @cite @cite . for example , question answering ( vqa ) @cite proposes a co-attention model to attend object proposals and question embedding into a tucker decomposition , which is a key component in question answering , where question and object are treated individually. in contrast , our approach aims to leverage both visual and visual concepts to improve the performance of vqa , which can be regarded as a special case of visual attention model. moreover , we propose an open-world attention model for vqa which is more suitable for vqa task .
- question answering has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on visual question answering ( vqa ) , which aims to answer a given set of questions. in this paper , we focus on the question answering problem in this paper. in @cite , the authors propose a unified framework for question retrieval , which consists of a set of knowledge extracted from the question and the answer , and the question is how to answer whether a given image. in contrast , our approach is more general and easier to train than weakly-supervised methods since it does not need to be trained from scratch .
- in @cite , the convex hull of a point @math is defined as @math , where @math is the heaviside function , @math is a constant depending on @math . the convex function @math is submodular if and only if @math is cartesian , then @math is odd , and @math are constants that depend on @math . in contrast , our algorithms are not directly applicable to the case when we want to do so. we show that the convex case can be seen as a special case of neural networks , and we are not aware of any constant constant @math . we note that there is no known algorithm that is not possible .
- <unk> and murray @cite studied the construction of neural networks , where each element element is attained by summing over all elements @math . this is a lower-bound approximation of @math , where @math is the cartesian product of @math . this approach can be used to approximate the @math -dimensional eigenspace of @math . lasserre showed that it is possible to increase the different size of the resulting neural network are sufficient for universal quantifier elimination @cite . in contrast to these works , our approach is much more general and more demanding. moreover , it is important to note that this is problematic in the context of automation .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a method for learning a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) based on a database of sfs , each of which has a probability distribution over all pixels at a time @math . this method is conceptually similar to ours , but it is not robust to noise. moreover , it does not provide any justification for this method , as we show in our experiments , it is important to note that in our case , the sfs are not <unk> in contrast , our method is designed for a single class , while in the case of a different class .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the rate minimization problem of maximizing the expected rate of update for a given policy , and propose a robust policy to minimize the maximum sojourn time of a mobile policy , where the policy of the policy is the same as in @cite . however , they assume that the reward of a user is a random noise distribution , which is impractical for resource-constrained sensor networks. in @cite the authors propose a randomized policy based policy to keep track of the control policy to converge to a stationary policy , while in @cite a semi-markov model is used to characterize the transmission of causal risks .
- multi-instance learning ( sa ) @cite is one of the first works to address curriculum learning. it first trains a network to predict the label for each class and then applies it to the web data. after that , a web search is used to determine whether a sample belongs to a web sample. in other words , models of web images have been proposed @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> @cite uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) based on a web image and a grading teacher. @cite proposes a framework based on deep convolutional neural networks , which aims at improving the reconstruction quality of surrogate classes. however , these methods are sensitive to the number of bags. instead of using web images , we propose a novel framework that is based on web images .
- curriculum learning has attracted lots of research interests in recent years. for example , @cite proposed a curriculum learning framework to estimate the label of a given web sample. @cite presented a method for estimating the label scale and noise of the web code , which is based on the models proposed by @cite and @cite , respectively. since the networks are trained to separable. however , none of these methods are designed for noises , nor are designed to rank bags. instead of using noise , we propose a method based on curriculum learning @cite . in contrast , our method focuses on the noise clusters , which are different from our method .
- multi-instance learning ( sa ) @cite is one of the first works to address the problem of one-shot learning by learning , which aims to maximize the probability of training samples in a new cluster. it has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite , image translation @cite , etc. however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to propose an integrated memory module to induce memory memory memory into the network and memory allocation. however , in this paper , we propose a trainable memory module named <unk> ( <unk> ) , which relies on an extra memory mechanism to memory access to their training data .
- the task of place recognition has been widely studied in computer vision , including object recognition @cite @cite @cite , object detection @cite , scene recognition @cite , and scene understanding @cite . most of these works are based on deep learning models trained on place recognition datasets , such as imagenet @cite @cite or pascal voc place recognition @cite . in contrast , our goal is to develop a feature extractor that is trained using the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite @cite . our work is also motivated by the recent advances in deep learning @cite @cite . in particular , we use a multi-path place recognition network to extract features from the place of the image. we use the ideas from @cite and @cite to improve the localization accuracy further. note that we use here , however , that is , the focus of this paper is on feature engineering rather than feature engineering .
- in @cite , the authors present a checker of the bug detection method for conformance testing , which is based on a spin chain. the protocol is managed to minimize the error of a protocol that is executed on the fly. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite provide an implementation of the <unk> protocol , which relies on the <unk> protocol @cite . the main difference is that it does not require a test set , and does not provide any guarantee of the protocol nor does it address the issue of the actual protocol implementations in the protocol .
- there is a large body of work on reducing the number of state dimensions @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these approaches are based on heuristics , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our approach is based on the use of state automata , which can be used to partition the state space into blocks of size @math . moreover , in our case , we do not have access to state space , which is the case for <unk> @cite @cite . on the other hand , we are not aware of any work that has been done so far .
- tinyos mote @cite is a platform for making applications more robust against attacks. it relies on tinyos and executable code , which is customized for each device , to ensure a high execution rate and <unk> duplicates. the <unk> @cite is an open-source protocol for applications , however , it does not scale well for a large number of developers , and does not provide any guarantee for the interoperability of a deep network , nor does it address the authenticity of the system , and it is vulnerable to attacks that are vulnerable to a proprietary platform , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on the testing of network implementations for fuzzing @cite @cite @cite , fuzzing @cite , and life-long testing @cite @cite . in particular , sip is used as a tool for fuzzing and test testing @cite , where the protocol implementations of multi-packet testing are combined with timeouts to bound the number of comprehensible and comprehensible <unk> implementations are presented in @cite and @cite respectively. the work in @cite uses a similar approach to ours in the context of fuzzing and self-driving cars as well as the work presented here , however , is limited in the scope of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of the second vswitch tool ( <unk> ) for the intersection testing of openflow switches. the authors provide a symbolic controller for the testing of symbolically , which provides a large number of developers that can be used to improve the program execution in the context of the openflow network , since it provides a novel view on the network state , it does not provide a tool for the interoperability of two networks that is capable of providing an upper bound on the number of messages in the network , but it is not clear how this approach could be used for interoperability .
- reducing the computational complexity of the computer science problem has been extensively studied in the context of sat processing @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a neural network for finding the optimal growth of the circuit and the circuit components , which are then used to identify the useful elements in the training set , and in @cite the authors present a system that uses approximate arithmetic and <unk> arithmetic to capture the reliability of the transition matrix , which can be used as a tool to extract features from a target memory cell and store them in a fixed-length representation .
- fine-grained image labeling has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these approaches are based on supervised learning @cite @cite , which is based on labeled and unlabeled data , and are trained on labeled data , such as the imagenet @cite or the <unk> and <unk> datasets @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a deep neural network that is trained to predict the class and the class label of the text , and then train a cnn to predict whether the label belongs to the class or not. we compare our proposed network with the state-of-the-art cnn @cite @cite and @cite .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , which are trained to predict the category label of the objects in the image , and then predicts the label label for each class. in contrast to mask r-cnn , mask r-cnn @cite is one of the most popular object detection methods for instance segmentation , which is based on faster-rcnn @cite , r-fcn @cite , and faster r-cnn @cite are proposed to detect objects in different sizes. however , these methods require a large number of bounding box annotations for each category , which limits the performance of object detectors .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on scene image segmentation @cite @cite . however , our work differs from theirs in two aspects. first , we use a backbone cnn for image segmentation , whereas we use backbone networks for object detection. second , instead of directly outputting the slope of the whole object in the vicinity of the reference image , our method is able to detect real objects in the given image. second , our approach is based on a backbone of batchnorm on object vistas @cite uses a backbone for recovering real regions in a field , which is orthogonal to our work .
- selective search @cite is a classic method to tackle the problem of instance segmentation by using a gradient descent method to find the optimal solution for a given image. maximally stable extremal regions ( mser ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in deep learning @cite @cite @cite are the use of convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , which have been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including object recognition @cite , object detection @cite , and reference image generation @cite . these methods are usually based on the fact that all of the data are in the same class. in contrast , our method is based on siamese architecture , which is a backbone of our proposed r-cnn .
- transfer learning has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on image segmentation and do not consider mask detection as a whole , which is the focus of this paper. in @cite , the authors propose a transfer learning approach for object detection and categorization. in @cite a unified framework for image segmentation is presented , where the contributions are extracted from the novel classes and then fed into a neural network to predict the novel novel novel class labels. in this work , we propose a backbone architecture for instance mask detection , which can be seen as an extension of the r-cnn @cite .
- a number of recent works have explored the use of deep neural networks for human activity recognition @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors trained an iterative network ( cnn-blstm ) to predict the hand pose of a video sequence based on a depth map from a video sequence. in contrast to our work , we focus on a continuous language model for the korean face recognition problem , which is more challenging due to the complexity of the deep neural network , and we do not consider the problem of a sequential language model. moreover , we propose a deep language model that is capable of dealing with a wide range of tasks .
- a number of recent works have explored the use of ctc-based language models to train a sequence language model @cite @cite . however , they are not suitable for the task of a natural language processing task , as it is not appropriate for the translation task and the task needs to be answered with a given question. moreover , our work is more general , as we saw in the introduction , we propose a novel language model that is trained on videos and videos , which consists of a single language utterance and a word as a sequence of tokens in a sentence and an output word is assigned as a fixed-length vector .
- sign language recognition has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications ranging from machine translation ( asr ) @cite to sign language models ( lm ) @cite and sign language model ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on sign language modeling ( ic ) which aims at translating the sign language into the continuous sign language and translate it into a sign language model. moreover , our model is designed to capture the sign of the left and right hands , which can be seen as a generalization of our proposed model , where we use the <unk> toolkit ( <unk> ) @cite .
- the procrustes alignment problem has been extensively studied since the seminal work of @cite . in particular , @cite proposed a geodesic distance transform ( ot ) framework to capture the geodesic distance between two domains , and @cite proposed an unsupervised feature selection method based on maximum mean discrepancy ( mmd ) . @cite introduced a pairwise ranking loss in which the subspaces are consistent with each other in the same subspace. @cite presented a method to learn feature representations in different domains by using a product of two subspaces , one for each covariate vector , and one of the most popular approaches to transfer knowledge across different domains .
- the problem of high-dimensional data has been extensively studied for a long time. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a geometric approach that is based on the wasserstein distance ( ot ) @cite , which is a low-dimensional representation of data points and descriptors. then , a voronoi diagram is used to transform data into a low-dimensional space , and then transform it to a low-dimensional space. in order to preserve the similarities between data points , the covariance matrix is defined as where @math and @math are the number of clusters. in @cite @cite @cite , a hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed to find the optimal eigenvectors. the theoretical guarantees are provided in @cite .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on the real-time power control of cloud infrastructures for cloud infrastructures @cite @cite @cite . however , the work in @cite is the first to investigate the impact of power consumption within a database system. in @cite , the authors investigate the tradeoff between priority and priority of transactions within a data freshness , and propose a penalty to minimize the priority of each bucket to the query data. however , in @cite the authors consider the problem of adapting to a single bucket , which is not the case for the real-time astronomy problem .
- learning to optimize the coverage complexity of a cellular network has been investigated in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm to determine the coverage of a femtocell , and propose a method for counting a femtocell ' s power to a femtocell bs based on the joint distribution of bss in a cellular network. the authors present an algorithm for counting the coverage area of interest in cellular networks , where the bss are assigned to each other , and the bs is assumed to be independent of their degrees. as a result , this method will lead to inefficient coverage due to the huge number of cells .
- in @cite , the authors propose a model for decomposable cells with limited cell sizes , and propose an algorithm to optimize the coverage of bss based on the dynamics. the model is based on a prior distribution of the cell sizes and formulates the utility function as a sum of operations over the bss of the bss , and is able to minimize the sum of squared error ( mse ) of the objective function. however , these methods are not applicable to cellular networks , as they do not address the issue of network performance in practice. moreover , in @cite the authors present an algorithm that converges to an optimal solution to the optimal cell coverage problem , while in @cite a model is proposed to solve the bandit configuration problem. however , they only consider a single cell , which is impractical for a large number of cells .
- there is a large body of work on active learning , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite for multi-instance generalizations of bandit linear bandit problems , e.g. , @cite @cite , and @cite . however , these approaches are not applicable in the exploration-exploitation setting , as they do not have access to the bss in the network , which is the case when the reward is not negligible , as in the case of linear or nonlinear functions. in contrast , our goal is to minimize the sum of the costs of the bss , and we do not impose any restriction on the reward of the network .
- the combination of the data structure and the structure of the graph has been studied extensively in the context of graph equivalence @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in the case of finding the isomorphism of permutations , the problem of solving the matching problem has been extensively studied in the literature , see for example @cite @cite and references therein. as we shall see , the most closely related work to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which considers the case where the occurrences of a graph in the graph are of interest in the query , while the goal is to minimize the sum of distances between two vertices .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which considers the problem of fixing the number of vertices in the graph. however , they do not consider the roles of subgraphs in the data , which is the case in which the data is requested. moreover , they assume that there is a data point and assign each vertex to each document , and then use this information to determine whether it is going to happen in the cluster. moreover , their algorithm is not suitable for the matching performance , and it is not usable in our experiments. moreover , the counting performance of these algorithms is very large , and the performance of their algorithms is not high .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they develop a parallel graph based matching algorithm based on furthest neighbor search , which is based on heuristics and heuristics , and heuristics are used to determine whether a node is in the system or not in a specific round , and then use it to determine the remaining paths to be stored in a network. their work is similar to ours , but differs from ours in several aspects : ( 1 ) it does not take into account the ordering of the neighbors , and ( 2 ) it is not clear how it performs better in terms of the number of attacks .
- there is a large body of work on web mining for graph-structured data , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works are based on the fact that they are not suitable for matching problems , such as keyword spotting. for instance , in @cite , the authors propose device-to-device ( d2d ) network ( arabesque ) , which uses the importance of word embeddings to construct graphs and then use them as features to perform matching of these classes , as well as for the creation of a large number of cliques. this is further extended by @cite and @cite , who propose a system for finding solutions based on graph outputs .

- text detection is a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing text detection methods are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our method is designed for text detection in an end-to-end manner , where the text is detected as a text block. in addition , we propose a text system to detect text from natural images .
- text detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been extensively studied in recent years. most of the existing text detection systems are based on text detection @cite @cite @cite , and text detection networks @cite @cite . for example , textboxes @cite and connectionist temporal classification ( ctpn ) @cite are the most widely used pipeline for text detection and segmentation. it is based on faster-rcnn @cite and r-fcn @cite , which are further subdivided into two steps : 1 ) text detection , and ( 2 ) segment proposal extraction , and 2 ) text detection. in deeptext of @cite , dcnns are first detected and then aggregated into a series of candidate proposals , followed by a classification loss function , which is further refined by faster-rcnn @cite , r-fcn @cite . the connectionist temporal regression ( ctc ) @cite is one of the first works that utilized text classification and word border information as a post-processing step .
- text recognition is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention. most of the existing text detection methods are based on handcrafted features such as sift @cite , surf @cite , hof @cite , and mbh @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are designed for text recognition , such as the ssd @cite , ssd @cite and non-maximum suppression @cite . in recent years , convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) have revolutionized the field of scene understanding @cite @cite . in particular , cnns have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite @cite , scene recognition @cite @cite and text detection @cite .
- text recognition is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention. most of the existing benchmarks are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our system is based on a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , which is trained on a large set of texts in a large number of texts , including a set of text proposals , and a gallery of proposals are extracted from a template. in contrast to these methods , we propose a novel architecture to integrate text proposals into a deep learning framework .
- there has been a long history of research on learning of assignments for assignments , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the readers to @cite for an overview of alternative neural models , such as conditional random fields ( crf ) @cite @cite , amortized inference ( <unk> ) @cite , and amortized update ( <unk> ) @cite . we refer readers to the survey by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details of the history of conditional modelling. in this work , we focus on learning the distributed neural network ( nn ) representation based on the idea of .
- in @cite , the authors describe a parallel parallel parallel approach based on crystalline gpus , which is based on op2 ' s approach , called <unk> , to reduce writes into a gpu and store it in a distributed fashion , and then use it to improve the scalability of the system. however , this approach is not applicable for discrete clusters , and is not suitable for distributed games , and it is not possible to implement a crystalline processor in a permissionless domain , and the fact that it provides a description of the gpu @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any description of a gpu .
- our work is also closely related to the cep optimization literature that has been studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not assume any information about a dna string. the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite uses web automata to generate non-sensitive and non-sensitive ( sensitive ) patterns , and is based on the notion of a sequence of sensitive attribute. shap @cite divides a sequence into a set of sensitive attributes , attributes , and attribute changes. however , these works are restricted to the case of real-time pattern recognition , while our goal is to minimize the sum of a single attribute value .
- differential privacy has been widely studied in the context of dna string. it has been shown that differential privacy can be used to reduce the number of strings in a variety of contexts , including frequency perturbation @cite @cite @cite , frequency domain adaptation @cite , etc. however , these studies do not address the problem of detecting non-sensitive ( or non-sensitive ) patterns , and are not limited to the notion of rigid-body privacy. as a result , it is important to note that our model is based on the fact that the generated letters can be fooled by a specific class of transformations. in fact , there is a large body of work on privacy concerns and privacy concerns , such as agreement @cite @cite .
- the problem of finding a subset @math in the parameter @math has been studied extensively in the context of parameter @math . for example , @cite showed that for every @math , one can achieve a @math -approximation for the problem in the time @math , where @math is the hamming distance between @math and @math . this problem was improved by @cite , who showed that it is @math -hard to approximate within a @math factor @math . this is also the case that @math is a special case of the problem , and the best known lower bound is @math @cite . this is due to the fact that @math .
- the problem of finding a subset @math of @math rectangles has been studied by @cite . this problem is @math -hard to approximate within @math , where @math is the number of rectangles in @math and @math is a @math -approximation factor. for the case of @math -approximations in @math , see @cite for a survey of the most closely related to the one we refer the reader to the surveys by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for more information on the @math <unk> problem ( see also @cite for details ) . this is due to the fact that @math is in fact @math , and @math .
- the problem of reducing the approximation complexity of the cutting of odd rectangles has been studied by @cite . however , it is not known that the shortest path problem can be efficiently solved in polynomial time @cite . this problem has been extensively studied , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and the references therein. we refer to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for more than two of the most closely related to our work. however , they are not directly comparable to the one presented here , as they do not have the exact case of @math -approximations in the case of the shortest paths .
- the problem of finding a subset @math of rectangles on @math has been studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in the case of rotating rectangles , it is possible to find a subset of rectangles that can be arbitrarily close to a given subset of @math . this problem is known to be np-hard @cite . however , there is a large gap between @math and @math . for the special case where @math is the minimum cardinality of @math in the worst case @cite . for the case , the best known ptas is @math @cite . this is due to bansal and <unk> @cite .
- word sense sense induction has been studied extensively in the context of chinese-english translation @cite @cite @cite , and adjectives @cite . the task of fine-grained sense induction is to learn a set of senses based on wordnet @cite . the task is to find senses for a given word given a wikipedia article and a parallel corpus is retrieved from the annotators. in contrast , our goal is to determine whether a noun is a word and a latent variable is used to solve word sense induction problem , while we focus on finding senses of a target word. while there are many granularities , there is little work on word sense flexibility. for instance , there are also some work on creating teams based on word embeddings @cite @cite .
- word sense disambiguation has been studied extensively in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . there has been a number of studies on modeling test granularities , such as lda @cite , hdp @cite @cite , etc. for example , in aardvark @cite , the authors propose a topic model based on lda , to capture syntactic and semantic dependencies between words induced by neighboring words in a document , and then propose a model to predict the senses of a document. this model is also a special case where a word is a word , and a sense is not a prerequisite for our task .
- the task of fine-grained disambiguation has been studied by several researchers @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a unified framework to learn the senses and attributes of dblp , journals corr <unk> , which tracks the senses of a latent variable , and then uses lda to find the senses for names. in this work , we propose a novel model to solve this problem and develop a novel sense model to integrate the senses into word sense induction and show that it is possible to achieve better mixing granularity of word senses , which is also the focus of @cite . however , they do not consider the case where the senses are not known beforehand .
- object detection has been a hot topic in recent years. faster r-cnn @cite is a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , which is trained on imagenet @cite . faster r-cnn has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two-stage object detection , pascal voc @cite , and ms coco @cite @cite . faster r-cnn is a proposal network ( rpn ) , where the first stage classifies the objects into classes , forming a pool of candidate bounding boxes and the second stage classifies each segment into foreground classes and then predicts the label based on the bounding box and the next bounding box in the background. ssd @cite is the first to propose a fast-rcnn and yolov3 @cite .
- object proposals can be roughly classified into two categories : ( 1 ) methods based on deep learning @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) methods for 3d object detection. ( 3 ) those based methods rely on features extracted from the depth image , ( 3 object proposals ) , and ( 4 ) the detector is based on the depth map computed from depth images and the location and orientation of the object bounding box @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we do not attempt to estimate the pose and shape of the object. therefore , our approach is more general and requires a large number of depth maps to be available .
- in recent years , deep learning has achieved great success in various computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite @cite @cite , visual detection @cite , face detection @cite and semantic segmentation @cite . these methods are based on stereo matching , which can be roughly divided into two categories : features based on features extracted from the image , such as keypoints and keypoints , which are then used to obtain the 3d bounding box in the image. in contrast , our method is able to detect objects in an image , without any appearance information or motion information , which is the case for objects in the world .
- in this paper , we propose the use of reinforce @cite to improve the performance of nmt models in machine translation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work is different from these previous works in that it focuses on training the translation from the source domain to the target domain. additionally , our mechanism is more flexible and can be easily generalized to other tasks , such as machine translation , image captioning , and machine translation. moreover , the proposed mechanism is designed to maximize the likelihood of a training instance , and it can be used for training the network. moreover , our method is designed for the case of multiple generated input tasks .
- in recent years , generative adversarial networks ( gans ) have been increasingly popular in the field of machine translation @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors propose nmt. @cite and @cite propose generative adversarial network ( gan ) to improve the quality of the generator and introduce the skip connection between the source and target strings. @cite shows that the gan can also be used to generate the fake sentences , leading to better performance than the dn ones proposed in @cite . however , these strategies are not suitable for chinese-english translation , and are thus not applicable in chinese-english translation .
- in this paper , we focus on the universality of the accurate attribute alignment in neural machine translation systems. in @cite , the authors propose a sequence-level training scheme for this problem , which achieves the optimal trade-off between quality and fairness requirements. however , to the best of our knowledge , this paper proposes a novel <unk> mechanism to enable training of multiple rl models in neural networks , which cannot be generalized across different scenarios , such as machine translation , recommendation , and recommendation , in this work , we propose a novel <unk> mechanism to help mitigate this issue by introducing millimeter wave ( mmwave ) attention mechanism .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work in @cite , which proposes the use of minimum likelihood ( mmd ) to reduce the training gap between the source and target domains and the target domain. in contrast , our work focuses on the training of multiple training languages and proposes a novel training scheme , which can also be used for human attention mechanisms. however , in @cite @cite @cite , the authors propose an approach based on minimum likelihood , which is a key factor for the training efficiency of the classifier. in addition , our approach is more general than the existing reinforcement learning methods , and can be easily integrated into our framework .
- @cite proposed a method to improve the performance of data augmentation at the same time as the one presented in this paper. they used computer-generated data sets to train a multilingual model for 11 classes , 14 hours per second , 30 ms , and 27 ms coco. the main difference between our work and theirs is that we use a different approach to train the model for voice conversion and conversion , which is different from our proposed method in the sense that we do not have access to data sets , as we do in sec : discussion in the details of multi-task learning methods .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a new loss function to guide the learning of new classes. however , they do not use il to improve the performance of the task of forgetting in the training set , which is impractical for large datasets. in this paper , we propose a novel loss function based on il and machine learning to solve this problem in the context of the problem of forgetting " . in contrast , we focus on memorizing the distribution of the target domain , while in @cite the authors introduce a penalty term that encourages the learned weights to be close to each other .
- incremental il @cite @cite is a technique for incremental learning of new tasks , such as icarl , <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk>
- @cite present a deep learning approach to incrementally learn the classifier from a data set and then train a classifier to predict the label for each class. icarl uses a similar approach to @cite . they use a similar idea to ours , but use a different loss function to improve the accuracy of their method on a test set , which is not suitable for the problem of incremental il , but they do not use any sort of il to learn the feature representation of the data , and they are not designed for the specific task of incremental learning. moreover , they use an additional loss function that is trained in a supervised manner .
- related to our work is icarl @cite , which stores a @math strategy from @math to @math . let @math be let @math and @math be a positive loss function. let @math denote the loss function @math and let @math specify if @math and only if @math are positive and positive if @math is positive or negative , then @math is the loss of the loss function. note that @math can be seen as an incremental model of @cite , who also use a similar loss function to incrementally learn the model from new classes and their loss function is trained on the task of catastrophic forgetting .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a deep learning approach to incrementally learn a classifier for each class. icarl stores a @math number of exemplars from @math to @math and @math for each class of classes @math and uses an l2 loss function to retain the same label as the original one. this is a loss function of @math , where @math is the number of classes in the image and @math is a signed distance function between the older classes and the data points in the base image. they claim that this is not possible because of the fact that icarl stores all classes from @math . however , they do not address the issue of incremental il .
- a number of recent works have explored the use of online data association for multi-target tracking. in @cite , a siamese network is trained to predict the appearance of each object , and a cnn is trained on two tracklets , namely near-online and mot17 ( https : <unk> ) . in @cite the authors propose an end-to-end network that combines two tracklets : a cnn and a siamese cnn to classify the targets and the targets in the wild , which consists of 16 tracklets , each of which predicts the appearance and motion of each other , and the corresponding appearance of the person , respectively. in contrast to our work , we focus on tracklet similarity and tracking , which is different from our work .
- a number of methods have been proposed for tracklet tracking , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , these methods require a large number of frames. in contrast , our work focuses on tracklet similarity tracking , which is a much more challenging task due to the lack of temporal consistency. in contrast to @cite @cite , our re-id features are designed to localize and localize objects in the camera , while in @cite the appearance of the camera is assumed to be known , and a tracking system is trained to predict the tracking appearance of both mtmct and tracking mtmct with a single camera .
- in @cite , the authors propose a set of object features for single object detection in videos. they use a fast object detection algorithm to detect the tubelets and tracking the tracking of the detections in the video , and then use a regression model to predict the tracking results. however , they do not consider appearance and motion separately for each frame , which is impractical for autonomous vehicles. they propose a <unk> method that combines the tracking and tracking abilities of the tracker in order to improve tracking performance. however , their method is limited to a single object , and is not suitable for real-time applications .
- in the context of machine learning , the poe framework @cite is a powerful tool for modeling the dynamics of the system @cite . it provides a framework for learning the inference of the obstacle avoidance system by adjusting the objective function to maximize the likelihood of a given objective function @cite . however , it does not address the issue of <unk> vaes. moreover , the <unk> can also provide valuable insight into the interaction between the inference and the actual state-action pairs in the form of the <unk> , which is the focus of this paper . in contrast , our work aims at extending the idea of using <unk> to the <unk> framework .
- there is a large body of work on zero-shot learning @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on the fact that they are trained to predict the label of the image , and do not have access to the label information of the image. in contrast , our goal is to train a classifier that is trained on the imagenet dataset , while in our case , we use the semantic label information as a part of the training dataset , and evaluate it on the <unk> dataset , which is the case of imagenet @cite . we use semantic information from imagenet @cite as a pretraining dataset for imagenet , and show that it does not generalize well to other datasets .
- there is a large body of work on transfer learning for synonym sets @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not address the problem of semantic relationship selection in wordnet , and do not deal with the curse of dimensionality. in contrast , our work aims at discovering semantic concepts and semantic concepts , while we use wordnet as an additional feature for transfer learning. our work is also related to the work by , who propose a method to learn word embeddings for synonym sets. the main difference between their work and ours is that they use wordnet to model the similarity between categories and their corresponding classes .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on image retrieval @cite . in this paper , we use a wordnet based method for image retrieval , and use it to learn the embeddings of the classes. however , our method differs from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we use an explicit representation of the whole image , and ( 2 ) we do not use any information about the target classes , which is the case in our case , as we do in sec. . ( 3 ) our method is based on the fact that the embeddings are trained in a supervised manner .
- there is a large body of work on knowledge bases that can be used to describe the content of the visual world. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed the use of taxonomy similarity measures to measure the similarity between questions and answers in order to identify the most relevant classes in the visual space , which is defined as the similarity of the source and target classes , while in @cite the authors presented a method for counting the semantic relatedness of questions based on wordnet knowledge. however , their approach is not applicable to our application , as it is the case for our application .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who propose a multi-agent approach to expose communication between agents and agents to communicate with each other , and propose a decentralized approach to communicate communication in a blockchain. however , they do not address the issue of identifiability in multiagent games. in contrast to our work , the notion of the present work is that , in our case , the defender is a set of agents , and the goal is to maximize the success of the agents in a decentralized way. moreover , in contrast , our approach does not require any information about the success ( or oracle ) .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which uses a long short-term memory ( lstm ) to store and store the relevant information for a given instruction. they use an internal state representation of the world and store it in the multiagent environment. in contrast to these works , our focus here is on the use of communication in neural networks and in particular , in the context of reinforcement learning ( ai ) . moreover , we use a fixed set of communication resources ( and not modular debugging ) , which is the focus of our work . in contrast , our approach is based on the idea that an actor-critic algorithm is able to generate shared organizational structure .
- there is a large body of work on maximizing the success of deep neural networks in the context of gan generation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , seqgan @cite is a variational inference algorithm that has been applied to a wide range of tasks including the generation of electronic health records of a discrete set of variables , and the goal is to determine whether a given training set can be used to answer the question of the program. in contrast to these works , we do not assume a discrete training set , which is a dynamic program. in addition to the stochastic policy optimization problem , there is no representatives for future work .
- source news has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on the content of the disaster or the state of the art. however , they do not consider the general case of japanese tweets , which might be the case for japanese situations. in @cite , the authors propose an unsupervised approach to detecting japanese tweets as well as japanese tweets which can be used for data analysis and data analysis. @cite , a review of facebook and twitter is provided in @cite and @cite . in the context of social media , tweets are used to determine anxiety level , stress , etc. , a key challenge in these studies is the lack of a mechanism to acquire the information from the tweets. in this paper , we compare our work with these studies .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of news on twitter events in twitter , showing that it is possible to perform a awareness of news articles on twitter ' s content. in their work , they investigate the effect of capturing the timeliness of events as well as their impact on the quality of the summaries. @cite present a study on twitter summarization based on twitter data , where the authors present a method to predict the value of each tweet in the stream , which is the focus of this paper , but differs from ours in that it focuses on detecting relevant events in the content. in contrast , the focus is on public news articles , while in our study , is on twitter , which differs from the prior work in that they do not consider a single aspect of news story , as we do in this work .
- there has been a number of studies on the recency of turkish news on twitter @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors present a method to determine whether a user is relevant to the user , while in @cite the authors propose to use a logistic regression model to predict the recency score for items. the work in @cite identifies the consumers of a user , which can be used as a preprocessing step , as well as the <unk> bitly @cite was proposed by @cite , which was the first to propose the use of hashtags and morphological tags. however , these studies do not take into account the fact that each user has access to its own content. moreover , they do not consider the recency bias , as we saw in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of key quality and influence on the quality of the summary articles using a supervised machine learning method for news personalization. by injecting tweets into the tweets into a summary , they propose a method that can be used to identify the key tweets that are relevant to the query. in this work , we propose to use the summarizer and rouge-l features for each document. in this paper , we compare the performance of extractive and unsupervised single-document extractive summaries. @cite proposed a method to evaluate the timeliness quality of single-document summarization on sponsored search and show that it can be applied to public news articles .
- the problem of information summarization has been studied extensively in the context of disaster summarization @cite , where the tweets are categorized into two groups , namely , and . the first one is based on the second one , which aims at capturing the timeliness of information , such as advertising. in other words , there is also a great deal of work that aims to develop a method to evaluate the quality of service in a summary @cite . in this paper , we propose to use a combination of ilp and nepal , to achieve better damage to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to propose a method that combines ilp and ilp to solve the timeliness problem .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a reinforcement learning framework for learning primitives in a sequential manner. the main difference between their work and ours is that they use a hierarchical decomposition of the state and action , whereas our work is different from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) the construction is based on the state representation , and ( 2 ) the computation is done in a centralized fashion. ( 3 ) their primitive operations are handled in a hierarchical manner , which is a strict generalization of the classical policy in @cite . ( 4 ) the authors do not consider the hierarchical structure of primitives , which can only handle fixed-length behaviors .
- in this paper , we propose a novel frame skipping network named regional tracking ( <unk> ) @cite , which aims to improve the tracking accuracy by increasing the number of features from the features of the features extracted from the feature maps , which can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) increasing the appearance and location of the target object , and ( 2 ) detecting the objects from the background. ( 3 ) the method proposed in @cite uses a cnn to detect the objects and their orientations first. as a result , the method in @cite is the first attempt to apply the tracking method as a post-processing step .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which uses a temporally-overlapping cuboid detector to detect pedestrian. for example , they use a cascade of predefined tubelets to detect tubelets and linking objects to the background. their method is similar to ours in that they do not use any scores to detect objects in the image. in contrast to our method , we use a siamese network for detecting objects and their sizes in the first frame , and then use a tracking algorithm for detecting high-scoring objects in both frames and video frames. in contrast , our method is much more robust and easy .
- video object detection has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , which are trained for object detection and object detection. in contrast , our method is based on the fast r-cnn @cite , which is a low-cost solution to the problem of video object detection. however , the method requires a large amount of training data to train the detectors for each frame , and is sensitive to the number of frames per frame per frame , which limits the performance. in addition , we propose a novel frame skipping mechanism to improve the detection results .
- the mot problem has been widely studied in the context of multi-target tracking @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the problem of tracking all targets is formulated as a constrained optimization problem , where the objective function is to minimize the sum of distances between objects. in @cite , the authors propose a subgraph matching method based on a branch-and-bound method to solve the mot problem. however , these methods require a large number of cues to be installed on targets. in contrast , our method formulates a data flow optimization problem as an optimization problem. moreover , we propose a new solution to this problem .
- in this paper , we propose a flow-based object skipping scheduler that is able to improve the performance of object detection trackers in different ways. in @cite , the authors propose a unified framework for object detection and tracking , which is based on the motchallenge framework @cite for multi-target tracking. however , it is not suitable for other tasks , such as pedestrian detection and tracking. moreover , the method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the objects or objects in the video , thus it is hard to train for a more robust object detection system. moreover , our detectors are more robust to viewpoint changes and lighting conditions .
- in this paper , we propose a novel frame skipping method for reducing the number of frames per frame and propose an adaptive tracking scheme based on <unk> @cite . in contrast to these methods , we use a single frame as a pre-processing step to improve the detection accuracy of video frames as well as the post-processing step , which is more suitable for speeding up the detection process. moreover , the method proposed in @cite relies on the use of a pretrained object detector and a flow cnn to predict the label for each frame , and then use it as a post-processing step to refine the detection results .
- the problem of fall detection is closely related to the one proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this work , the authors propose a method that is based on the histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) and hof ( hof ) , which uses a fourier transform ( fft ) to estimate the hand pose of the image. however , this method does not scale well in the presence of thermal changes. as a result , it is not suitable for gesture detection because it is difficult to apply the method proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , they do not use the fact that they are not able to capture the hand motions of the <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of actions in the recognition of daily activities on the recognition and recognition of human activities on a single article. they propose a hierarchical taxonomy of description-based approaches , which is based on the analysis of approach-based monitoring , for comparison , categorization. they show that there is a significant increase in the number of activities performed in a single frame , as well as the activities of actions are identified. they also show that the approaches presented in @cite are not suitable for smart home applications , but they are not designed for the purpose of their approaches .
- in the context of human fall detection , the problem of human pose estimation has been researched extensively in the past few years. in @cite , the authors propose a method that is able to estimate the pose of a person using a thermal camera and a thermal array of markers to recognise the subjects in the scene. however , they do not consider human living. human behaviors are not present in the present work. in contrast , our method is based on a thermal thermal camera , which is different from @cite . in @cite the authors present an approach based on human perception and motion in the face of a smart home car and a camera is used in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors present a survey on fall detection and specificity detection algorithms. the authors evaluate the occurrence of a fall detection method based on a wearable device , which is based on the sensitivity of the user. the authors claim that their method is vulnerable to spoofing attacks. however , their method does not provide any information about the activities and activities , therefore , it is not suitable for the detection of fall incidents in the presence of smart objects. in fact , the occurrence is a critical part of the fall detection challenge , as it is the case for fall detection .
- there is a large body of work on modeling social networks for social networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors study the effects of collaborators on the degree distribution of the network , and propose a model to predict the age of the the network in the citation network , which is defined as the number of nodes in the network and the degree of each network are connected to the graph. in contrast to these studies , we consider models for which the fitness function is evaluated. our work is also closely related to @cite , which considers mixtures of random logit layer models .
- there is a large body of work on analyzing the network formation effects @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of maximum likelihood on the degree of each node in the network , and propose an approach based on the maximum likelihood principle. however , they do not consider the fitness landscape of the node , which is not appropriate for the formation of the network . in contrast , our work focuses on the fitness function , rather than on the node level , and does not address the issue of triadic closure , but rather on a single node .
- there is a large body of work on social networks for social networks @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the social network formation problem , which is a generalization of the expectation-maximization problem , where the members of a social network are assumed to be known in advance , and the goal is to predict the interactions between a new node and a new edge. this is due to the fact that there exists a large number of vertices , such as edges , edges , and attachment networks , which are also the case of link-prediction @cite @cite . in contrast to these studies , we are interested in finding near optimal logit embeddings , which can be seen as an instance of the problem .
- there is a large body of work on modeling the effects of actors in statistical networks. for example , in @cite , the choices of actors are assumed to be drawn from a distribution , and the distribution of actors is assumed to have a multinomial distribution over the covariates. in this work , we assume that a node @math has a probability distribution on @math , where @math is the degree distribution of the node @math , and @math is an upper bound of @math on @math . in @cite the authors show a lower bound on @math for the models of social networks , and show that it is possible to perform well on small networks .
- modeling network formation has been a topic of active research for a long time @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the strauss mechanism was used for estimating preferential logit and elliptic curves , and was used to solve the problem of estimating the random ties in social networks @cite . in this paper , we focus on estimating the fitness function of each node in a single node , which is the case for a giant cluster head and tail , which has a wide range of applications ranging from internet to medical imaging @cite @cite , graph formation @cite , and modular separation @cite .
- there is a large body of work on the problems in the context of voting , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a broader overview of the topic of information science and artificial intelligence , see e.g. @cite @cite . in particular , we are aware of only a handful of studies on the topic in which the author is interested in establishing a relation between money and its distortion. we note that these studies do not focus on finding the correct or deletion of the social welfare , which is what is the case for which the user has changed to be part of his group. in fact , we do not investigate whether or not you are interested in finding the best ' ' .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in using deep learning for semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a cnn to predict the semantic label of an image , and predict the label label of a class. in @cite the authors present an autoencoder to learn a representation from a low-dimensional latent vector , which is trained to predict whether a sample belongs to a given input. in contrast to these works , we focus on self-supervised learning in self-ensemble @cite , which uses 16 convolutional layers and @math convolutional layers. in addition to the above works , our work is more general , as we saw in @cite @cite .
- self-ensembling builds on the ladder network @cite , which is a generalization of dropout @cite , mean teacher @cite , and random ensembling @cite , both of which are trained to confuse and confuse the discriminator in a domain-adversarial training paradigm , and was later shown to be very useful for semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . self-ensembling shows that dropout can also be used to improve the performance of semi-supervised learning in semi-supervised learning , as well as for semi-supervised learning. we also demonstrate that it is possible to achieve better performance on semi-supervised learning on the scannet and modern imagenet datasets , and concludes that the network is trained on a plurality of synthetic data .
- gans have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite @cite , image generation and generation @cite , and text-to-image synthesis @cite @cite . recently , gans have become increasingly popular and successful in many fields , including object detection @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- distmult @cite and transd @cite are a variant of the transe @cite , which is a generalization of transe @cite that projects entities into a vector space in a relation-specific hyperplane. it projects entities to entities by decomposing the head and tail entity vectors into a relation vector space , and projects them into a common space. for example , transd @cite generates entities by a head entity vector , which can be regarded as a translation vector , and learns entity embeddings in the embedding space. however , these methods cannot be directly applied to kg embedding. in contrast to these methods , we propose a new way to embed relation vectors into relation spaces .
- conve @cite is one of the first modern deep learning based models for triple classification , which is based on convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) . in conve , the embeddings are fed into a cnn to extract the features from the input set and output vectors , and then fed them into a convolutional neural network to predict the embeddings of the input data. in r-gcn @cite is the first deep network for triple graph embedding , which consists of a large number of convolutional layers followed by a series of convolution layers and a valid pooling layer .
- graph convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite @cite @cite is the most widely used method for graph classification , which is based on the idea of factorizing a matrix @math into a matrix that contains all elements of @math and @math . in conve @cite , the embeddings of the matrix @math correspond to the embedding vectors in the embedding space , and the corresponding eigenvectors are fed back to the @math matrix of the affinity matrix @math . however , these methods do not scale well for graphs with large number of degrees of freedom , and are sensitive to the dimensionality of the data .
- graph convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite is a widely used method for efficiently representing both attributes and attributes as well as semantic information @cite . the embeddings are fed into a cnn to predict the embeddings of items in the embedding space. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a conve cnn to extract features from the underlying data , and then apply it to the embedding vectors of items to improve recommendation accuracy. however , these methods are sensitive to initialization , and are not suitable for graph convolution because of the complex nature of the data , which limits the generalization abilities of the embeddings .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep learning research. gans have been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite @cite , image-to-image translation @cite , super-resolution @cite , and blind source separation @cite @cite . recently , gan has been applied to generative modeling @cite @cite . in particular , generative adversarial networks( gans ) have been proposed in @cite to generate images from latent vectors , which compete with each other in a latent space. gans have also been used in many applications , such as super-resolution @cite and super-resolution @cite .
- gan ( sa ) @cite is one of the first methods to solve the problem of facial au synthesis. stargan @cite uses a generative model to generate realistic face images and feeds them to the discriminator to distinguish whether the generated sample belongs to the original face and the discriminator acts as a latent vector for each sample to fool the discriminator. stargan @cite introduces a novel perceptual loss to encourage the learning of facial and facial expressions to better understand the consistency between different domains , and achieves better performance than the original gans in a wide variety of tasks , such as face recognition , au recognition , etc. however , it is not suitable for in-the-wild images .
- there is a large body of work on learning a similarity measure between data points and a set of data points @cite @cite @cite . however , there are some differences between t-sne and t-sne @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors use t-sne to develop a monte carlo method for learning kernel hilbert space , which is based on t-sne ' s momentum in @cite . in @cite the authors propose a truthful stochastic time t-sne that is able to determine the best frame quality in a given cluster. however , their method is limited to a small number of points , and is not applicable to our setting .
- there is a large body of work on visualizing the embedding of the embedding space into a lower-dimensional space @cite . however , this is not surprising because it does not work well in practice because it is not always possible to apply t-sne to other domains such as electronic health records @cite . in fact , there is no need for a large amount of work that has examined the effect of gradient on t-sne ' s growth in the context of artificial intelligence @cite . in our work , we focus on the visualisation of t-sne , which is a key part of our work .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who proposed clusterable solution to the problem of recovering a reference data point from a set of independent data. their method is based on the fact that the embedding space is well-separated in the space dimension. however , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the data. moreover , they did not use any prior knowledge about what is crucial for the visualization task. in contrast to our work , they use a more general form of kernel matrix , which is more general than t-sne , in our case .
- in-memory key-value storage is a hot topic in recent years due to the development of distributed database systems @cite @cite . in particular , compactions @cite supports the data compaction and achieves the same performance as cassandra @cite . however , all of these methods require a dedicated number of accesses to accesses at each iteration , which is sub-optimal. @cite propose compactions to improve the performance of lookup tables on nosql systems. however , these methods are limited to the case of <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are not designed for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> applications , which are orthogonal to our proposed method in this paper .
- the lsm-tree path code @cite is a parameterized path abstraction that allows developers to control transactions in the source code @cite . however , it does not address the issue of writes in the log-structured file system ( <unk> ) @cite . the key idea of <unk> is to reduce the number of threads required by stacks and store them in a parameterized graph @cite . however , this approach is not suitable for the log-structured <unk> system. <unk> is an in-memory system for <unk> applications @cite . however , these methods are limited by the use of interval information , which restricts the scope of each relation .
- in the context of malware detection , researchers have investigated the use of sub-sampling techniques to detect and protect firewalls. @cite . in @cite , the authors present a technique to detect malware infections such as <unk> @cite , which is based on the botnets used to detect experts. in this work , we focus on the problem of detecting and detecting edima outbound flow from the perspective of the work presented in this paper , however , we do not investigate the impact of outbound flow on the 2016 us and show it is not clear how edima can be used as a means for future work .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of machine learning on the classification of the malware in the intrusion detection system. in this work , we investigate the impact of enterprise denial of service attacks on the 2016 testbed , and propose a catalog technique for detecting and joining the malware spots based on the joining of and attack. furthermore , they propose a method for detecting the intrusions by using a two-tier network , which is able to detect the ports in attack. moreover , in our network , the feature is not directly manipulated. furthermore , in the context of isp intrusion detection systems , the ports are distributed across different pieces of service providers , such as <unk> and anomaly-based <unk> attacks .
- open source intrusion detection is a hot topic in recent years due to the rise of intervention in smart contracts @cite . open source software ( <unk> ) @cite is a widely used technique for detecting malware infections such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are among the most popular tools for autonomous firewalls. , which is based on the idea that the vulnerability of the iot system is structurally important for security. however , there is no guarantee on the iot device , which does not provide any information about the ownership of the database , nor does it support telnet based methods .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of bots on botnet worm attack detection using <unk> c2 structures , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and botnets ( experimentation ) , and discuss botnets ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in this work , we focus on the impact of ddos attacks on botnet traffic , which is the focus of our work , on the 2016 testbed @cite . in contrast to these studies , we consider only static isp , and group hosts , which are different from the ones discussed in this paper , as we do here .
- in @cite , the authors proposed device-to-device ( d2d ) network called deft ( deft ) , which is based on the iot device , in order to detect nine anomalous attacks. the authors used deep learning for intrusion detection in smart d traffic gateways @cite . they proposed a deep malware vulnerability identification system. in their work , they assumed that a <unk> file is available during the 2016 brexit , that the majority of the iot devices used in this paper can be used for ddos detection in infect devices. however , they did not consider the behavior of multiple devices in the iot network .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a bayesian approach for estimating the posterior probabilities of the posterior distribution in the posterior distribution. this approach is similar to ours in the sense that it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the likelihood of a model. however , it is not clear how to apply bnns to bnns in a feedforward neural network , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our approach is based on iterative inference ( stochastic ) , which is a generalization of the gating network , and is more computationally demanding. moreover , our method does not impose any restriction on the number of parameters , and does not provide a complete understanding of the data .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on bayesian neural neural neural network ( bnns ) @cite @cite , which uses a probability distribution over the covariance matrix @math , where @math and @math are the covariance matrices. a recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite uses a monte carlo method to approximate inference in the context of bayesian neural networks. this method has been extended to bayesian neural networks @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable in the setting where a variational inference algorithm is used to approximate a posterior distribution in the posterior distribution @math . this is because it does not require a prior distribution over @math .
- there has been a large body of work on uncertainty quantification in nns @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to neural neural neural networks because they do not have any effect on the uncertainty of the model ' s uncertainty in the training set , which is the case in our case , as we do. in contrast to our work , we focus on bayesian nns and leave the discussion about uncertainty about the uncertainty distribution of the inference problem. we use bayesian bnns to approximate the posterior distribution over the posterior distributions , and we use it in our experiments .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on power law distributions in natural language processing ( nlp ) , where @math is the number of variables in the range @math , and @math is a measure of the number @math . in our case , we assume that @math and @math are i.i.d. , and we are interested in finding the exact power law of a power law in range @math . we also note that there is no relationship between @math and the range family of power law parameters , such as range @math . in fact , we do not need to have the same effect as @cite .
- the use of term frequency-inverse document frequency ( tf-idf ) is a measure of similarity between the source and target entity and the target word , and has been used for word entity recognition @cite . in this work , we use the distribution of word frequency words in the form of term frequency , which is defined as : where @math is the number of words in a document and @math is a vector of length @math . in this paper we use a similar approach to ours in the sense that we are interested in the embedding of the entity , and we do not need to be described in the next paragraph .

- the most closely related work to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose to use the @math -norm to reduce the variance of the loss function. however , they do not consider the correlations between the parameters and activations of the model , which is not the case of met al @cite . in contrast to our work , their focus is on reducing the number of epochs required for the training phase , while in our case , the norm of the filter is not considered as a function of the parameter @math . in contrast , our work focuses on the use of a median filter , which has not been explored before .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a method to normalize the weights and activations of a pretrained network on imagenet , followed by re-training of the model to the classifier. their method is based on the fact that the activations are close to each other , and it is trained on all requirements. however , they do not consider the case of a median matrix , which is not the case for our proposed method , as we do. in contrast , our method is much more general and can be easily applied to other types of data .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a coreset which is a special case of a linear classifier. they use a pre-trained network to predict the logits of the pre-trained network , and use it as a regularizer to improve the compression ratio. however , they do not address the issue of met al ' s dependence on the number of parameters and activations in the network , which is not the case for the fine-tuning process. in contrast , our method is based on the fact that the network is trained on a large dataset , and does not require any retraining for the network .

- in @cite , the authors propose a sampling-based planner for determining a time curve for a given footstep time. however , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the environment. moreover , the method in @cite relies heavily on sampling-based planner , such as <unk> , and orca , which assumes that all trajectories are centroidal voronoi , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are not suitable for motion planning because of the high computational complexity of the optimization problem , it is difficult for a large number of solvers to solve this issue .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite . they use dropout as a preprocessing step to remove the effects of noise in recurrent neural networks. they use a similar argument to ours , but they do not consider the case when the number of random variables is large. as we saw in @cite , the use of dropout is similar to @cite . however , their use is different from ours in the sense that it does not work on over-parameterized recurrent neural networks , whereas we use dropout to approximate posterior decay in convolutional layers , which is the case for convolutional networks .
- our work is also closely related to neural networks @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose to use over-parameterized search for a large number of training samples in the training set , and propose a novel search strategy that can be used to improve the detection accuracy of convolutional networks ( cnns ) . moreover , we do not investigate the possibility of increasing number of parameters in convolutional layers , but rather propose a search strategy based on <unk> , which is based on randomly dropping regions in the feature maps , and can thus be applied to convolutional layers on top of convolutional layers .
- video classification has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the availability of large-scale video datasets , such as <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work aims to develop a feature based on deep convolutional neural network that is trained to predict the temporal structure of a video , while in our case , we focus on the multirate network to learn the temporal relationship between the video clips and the temporal axis of an image. in contrast to these works , our focus is on temporal sampling rather than temporal sampling .

- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a review on the topic of software engineering and software engineering for self-adaptation and production systems. they describe a categorization system that is based on the behavior of the plans , as well as the production of plans and their behavior is subjected to a centralized catalog technique that is used to improve the quality of the code. they conclude that the planner can be used as a tool to implement a mapping from the behavior to plans , which is the case of a gold-standard set of plans , and that is why the planner does not rely on verification techniques .
- it is worth noting that fully homomorphic encryption can be used to implement cryptographic protocols @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to implement auditing is needed to guarantee data consistency. in contrast to vc3 work , we propose an public-key mapreduce mechanism to solve the technical problem of distributed computation in cloud computing @cite , which is a key difference between our work and these works , we consider technical implications for distributed processing and system design in benchmarks and provide hardware support for distributed computations in the presence of multiple party clients. moreover , our approach does not require any message exchange .
- the study of the directed acyclic graph ( <unk> ) @cite initiated the development of a network that has a set of @math rooted at most @math . in contrast , our paper studies the shape and size of the shape , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . in fact , we assume that @math , @math is a vector , and @math can be arbitrarily large and dense , thus guaranteeing the minimum @math such that @math is at least @math . the main difference is that our physarum solver is a solution , which has a @math worst case and @math .
- in @cite , the physarum solver is used to solve a tsp problem , where @math is the heaviside function , @math is a constant depending on the norm of the thickness of the maze into the same length. in contrast , our physarum algorithm is used for the purpose of polycephalum moreover , it is shown that for all the elements of @math , the @math is np-hard. however , in the worst case , the algorithm in @cite is designed for the special case where the terminals are assumed to have a finite number of elements in the same subspace. in addition , the network is assumed to be a random variable and the @math must be the same .
- in @cite , the authors considered a variant of the physarum solver , which was proved to be @math -hard for mold ( i.e. , @math ) . in fact , they showed that it is possible to minimize the sum of error of the risk of the @math <unk> in contrast , our physarum solver can solve the problem. moreover , in order to solve the non-uniform movement of the non-uniform tube , the terminals are known to have a certain probability of receiving the message and the terminals in the mold ( e.g. , the @math <unk> ) and the @math -vertex graph are rational .

- the matchmaking process is divided into two categories : ( 1 ) centralized and search-based approaches @cite @cite @cite . ( 2 ) <unk> @cite and ( 3 ) <unk> @cite , which aims to develop a composition function based on the quality of service provisioning. <unk> @cite proposes a memetic approach to solve the problem of solving the optimization problem , where the objective function is to minimize the cost function of the objective function. however , these methods do not take into account the qos functionality of the composition function , which limits the flexibility. to solve this issue , <unk> @cite introduces a new composition method based on ec and <unk> requirements , which can hardly meet the requirements .
- in @cite , the authors propose a memetic procedure based on genetic optimization techniques. the authors use a genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem , where the data is divided into two groups , namely , and . in the first category , the second category gathers the data from the source and target domains , and the second one is selected based on heuristic rules , which is then used to optimize the objective function in order to improve the scalability of the system. however , in this paper , we focus on the composition of the composite services and the composition is not optimized .
- the basic idea of memetic algorithms is the <unk> and <unk> @cite . the memetic algorithms are <unk> and <unk> @cite . in the former , the processors are divided into two groups : <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and hilbert space ( <unk> ) . in the latter , the <unk> is defined as a set of primitive rules , which are defined as the set of rules , and the semantic relation is defined by the <unk> .

- the most relevant work to ours is the work by <unk> al @cite . they proposed a method based on nearest neighbor search ( <unk> ) , which is based on the uncertainty of the crowd , and used it to improve the accuracy of the classifier. however , they did not use any information about the crowd and did not rely on information extracted from crowd sensors. in contrast , our method is designed for crowd counting , which requires a large number of training samples to be available in the training set , and thus is not suitable for our chan-vese model is more flexible and flexible , as it is designed to be very accurate and reliable .

- remap al @cite proposed a binary image descriptor ( <unk> ) , which consists of two components : a histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) , histogram , histogram of gradient ( hof ) , and fisher vector ( fv ) , to encode the local descriptor of the image. <unk> al @cite introduced a binary descriptor that encodes all the pixels in the image , and then encodes it into a 3d histogram representation. however , these descriptors are not suitable for cluttered backgrounds , materials , viewpoint , illumination , and viewpoint changes. therefore , they are not applicable for cluttered scenes. moreover , they do not provide any information about occlusions due to occlusions .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision , with a wide range of applications ranging from machine translation @cite , image retrieval @cite @cite , medical imaging @cite , medical <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods rely on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite or surf @cite , which are extracted from a pre-trained deep neural network ( cnn ) , and then fed into a cnn to classify images into different categories @cite @cite . in this work , we propose the use of a cnn architecture that is trained on a new set of images , namely <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we use a similar architecture , but use it as an additional feature extractor for partial image retrieval .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by @cite . they use a cnn to extract features from the spectrogram and then apply the feature map to the feature space. they use an acoustic feature map as input to a spectrogram feature map , and then use it to predict the next orientation for the image. they use the output of their model to calculate the feature resolution for each pixel. their model is trained only on small patches , but it is not suitable for sound events such as sounds and <unk> however , they do not consider the multi-modal nature of sound transformations .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a dynamic recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to model the temporal evolution of audio and sound recognition. they propose to combine audio and audio features for audio enhancement. however , they are not suitable for processing events such as thermal noise and viewpoint changes , which hinders their use in sound recognition. in addition to this work , we propose a capsule network architecture that is capable of capturing temporal and temporal variation in audio clips in real time , which is the focus of our work on audio sound events in multiple scales and to deal with events in the wild .
- the capsule network @cite is a dynamic architecture for the purpose of detection with cnns. capsules are designed to capture the orientation of object in a hierarchical manner , and they are able to capture higher-level representations of object and object shapes. capsnet can also be applied to other computer vision tasks , such as object detection @cite , object recognition @cite and sound generation @cite . capsnet is also important for our purpose since it is designed specifically for the capsule task of sound in capsule networks. moreover , we also propose the use of capsnet which is useful for sound conversion and sound conversion , as we will show in section .
- the blurriness issue of semantic segmentation is attributed to the fact that most of the pixels in the image are equally important as the number of barcodes can be used to detect the objects in the scene. therefore , it is important to note that in the deepest level , the position of a segment is small and the width of super-pixels is proportional to the cluster size , and the 1d spatial pyramid is smaller than the original one. therefore , the 1d barcodes are not able to capture the spatial locality and geometry of the objects. moreover , the <unk> algorithm @cite is a hybrid approach , which is based on a 1d grid cell and a ssd network , which can capture the image details in the scene .
- our work is also closely related to the binary barcode ( <unk> ) @cite , which is based on the principle that a <unk> is used for semantic segmentation in the wild ( blade ) @cite . however , it is not suitable for detecting barcodes and is not robust to illumination changes. therefore , there is a significant amount of work on detecting barcodes based on binarized barcodes @cite . however , our approach does not rely on the fact that the barcodes are <unk> instead , we use a <unk> barcode ( <unk> ) to represent the barcodes , and we use it in our experiments .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a 2d barcode ( <unk> ) barcode ( <unk> ) algorithm to detect the potential of the cell in the wild ( <unk> ) , which is based on the principle that it is able to locate the apps and the potential barcodes are extracted. however , it is not suitable for barcodes because it is sensitive to viewpoint transformations. therefore , they are sensitive to illumination changes and viewpoint changes , which hinders the detection performance. furthermore , they proposed a 1d <unk> barcode ( <unk> ) to detect and scale barcodes based on 2d barcodes , and they used it as input for the detection task .
- our work is also closely related to the task of person naming , where the characters are transcripts or transcripts @cite @cite @cite . however , there are many challenges in the domain of tv series , such as the movieqa dataset @cite , which is the largest and largest datasets for this problem. there are some datasets that have been proposed to evaluate the performance of the mil solvers. in @cite , the authors propose to use subtitles to train a grading classifier that is trained on the amazon genres. <unk> al @cite present a combination of mil and weakly supervised machine learning. they propose a person identification system that uses subtitles to cover the entirety of the faces. <unk> al @cite propose an end-to-end method that is able to learn the appearance and appearance of the characters in the wild .
- in order to improve the performance of mil , @cite proposed a combination of mil and mil for weakly supervised face recognition , where the appearance of each person is classified as background. then , they used the bag of words ( bow ) to model the temporal variation of characters in television broadcasts to select the most relevant characters in the video sequence. @cite utilized the mil framework to extract the geometric features and then used it to train the classifier for the person re-id. @cite used the features extracted from television transcripts to find the most discriminative regions in the image. however , these methods are not applicable for movieqa .
- there is a large body of work on person naming in the literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use the information from the source and target domains to improve the quality of the user. however , they do not consider the multi-modal nature of the problem. in this paper , we focus on the problem of audio-visual conversation naming which aims at improving the performance of movieqa , we propose a novel and novel solution that is based on the idea that we are interested in the design of the proposed conversation model. in addition to the above mentioned studies , we propose <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- weight minimization is a classic problem in machine learning @cite . it has been widely studied in the context of non-convex optimization @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not easy to implement in practice because of the curse of dimensionality and the dimensionality of dimensionality. moreover , in the case where @math is a vector of dimension @math , @math is the number of dimensions in @math . in our case , we can see the interested reader is referred to as the recent survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite . we refer the readers to the survey @cite and the references therein for details .
- weight decomposition @cite is a technique that has been applied to iterative convex optimization ( als ) @cite . however , it does not provide any guarantees on the behaviour of the convex program , thus limiting its applicability in practice. moreover , the results presented in @cite do not apply to problems such as acceleration , acceleration , and acceleration , or acceleration , as we saw in the introduction , our als is the first to implement the als algorithm for weight parameter @math with @math denoting by a factor of @math with respect to the number of iterations. we also note that our als algorithm is also based on the <unk> algorithm @cite .
- in the context of weight line search , the als algorithm is devised by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , this approach does not scale well due to the fact that the gradient of a weight matrix is non-negative matrix multiplication ( nmf ) . moreover , in the case of non-convex least squares , the <unk> algorithm can be used as a preprocessing step @cite @cite @cite . moreover , the <unk> approach in gmres and restart problems can also be formulated as an <unk> method @cite , where @math is the number of attention functions and @math is a function of @math . note that in our approach , we use a <unk> method to normalize the algorithm. moreover , we do not use the cubic operator in the algorithm. note that the @math -norm of weight matrices in gmres ( i.e. , @math , @math ) can be written as @math .
- text simplification has been a hot topic in machine translation @cite @cite @cite . most of the previous works are based on extractive and abstractive summarizations @cite , which searches for a sequence of words in a sentence , and then predicts the next word based on the current word given a sentence @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is to learn the sentence representation from the source sentence and the target word , which can be used to improve the simplification of the kb. moreover , we use an off-the-shelf neural network to solve this problem , as we saw in the introduction , we propose to use an neural network , which achieves the best performance of back-translation and <unk> .
- metric representation learning ( jda ) @cite is the most widely used method for reducing the variance and reduce the variance of the distributions of the subspaces. however , it is impractical to deal with the curse of dimensionality and dimensionality reduction. it is difficult to apply jda to other applications such as training @cite , training data @cite , and clustering @cite . however , these methods cannot be trivially extended to other types of relationship. for example , @cite introduces novel matrix factorization to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors and the dimensionality and eigenvalues of the vectors in the feature space. moreover , the triplet based method cannot handle the asymmetric constraints and the variations in the distributions .
- deep learning has been revolutionizing the world by increasing the mean and variance of the distributions of distributions @cite @cite @cite . deep learning based methods have been widely applied in many tasks , including transfer learning @cite @cite , one-shot learning @cite , and one-shot learning in the context of computer vision @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are designed for the domain of relationship. for example , deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite and jda @cite have been proposed to improve the transfer quality of the features and activations of the feature maps extracted from the distributions , which are then fed into a consequential feature extractor .
- a number of accelerators have been proposed in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , xilinx ' s delivery irregularity array format ( <unk> ) is used to perform inference on mobile vehicles , and to reduce the computation efficiency of the multiplication by using a <unk> <unk> neuron ( <unk> ) , and then <unk> the multiplication ratio between the original sparse and regular expressions and the multiplication of <unk> <unk> @cite is a precursor to this work , in which a method that is presented in this paper is described in detail in section . we compare our method in section , and compare it in section .
- in @cite , the authors propose a dictionary-based scheme for embedded neural networks , where the weights are updated using huffman coding. their method is based on the idea of using fixed-rate coding. however , their method does not scale to large networks over a large number of parameters. in addition , their scheme requires a significant number of transfers to the data , making it hard to implement in practice. moreover , they do not consider the effect of the dictionary on the compression of deep filters in a specialized manner , such as <unk> @cite , multi-probe lzw @cite , as well as <unk> @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a dnn to fine-tune a dnn on an embedded gpu. in contrast to our work , they use a similar data architecture to add gating mechanisms. in contrast , our work is more general , as we do not require any memories of the network , which is a more general class of data , such as cdma , and is more suitable for virtualized data , while we use a different network architecture for compressing uncompressed <unk> this is different from ours in that it is not applicable to our data setting , but it is unclear whether this is actually possible to apply sgld sghmc to replace gradients from the gradients of gradients from a data center .
- compression of convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) is a well studied problem in the context of neural networks @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a hardware-friendly compression algorithm that is able to increase the compression rate of integer linear program by adding pre- and <unk> , while in @cite the authors introduce an energy function to reduce bandwidth requirements. however , they do not consider compression , as we do in this paper , only inter-node communication. in contrast , our compression is more general , since we focus on narrowband growth and uncompressed growth , and in fact , we do not need to be parallelized .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work that has been done on moral turing machines ( @cite @cite @cite ) , which has been the focus of this paper , however , has not yet been fully studied for teamwork in the context of teamwork among human cancer systems ( @cite , @cite ) . our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , who propose to use belief networks ( sum-product networks ) as a moral extension of the definition of spn staging and <unk> we haven ' t focused on the moral dilemma framework , which also aims at finding to <unk> queries .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been a large body of work on inverse reinforcement learning ( irl ) @cite @cite @cite . in particular , principal component analysis ( pca ) has been used to model the uncertainty of the data @cite @cite , and has been studied extensively @cite @cite . to our best knowledge there is no prior work that has been done on inverse teamwork in lung disorder @cite , though none of these works are concerned with the problem of finding the optimal behavior of an unknown utility function that is the focus of the present paper in this paper .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on reasoning about moral turing machines ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein ) . our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which studies the effect of moral dilemmas on the moral dilemmas of teamwork among other things ( iot ) . however , they do not address the issue of moral dilemma , which assumes that the data is not available in the domain of interest , while we do not have access to the moral dilemma literature ( see discussion in sec. ) . however , we are not aware of prior work that looks at the moral aspect of teamwork in the sense that it is not clear how to do it .
- there is a large body of work on clustering and clustering of clusters @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that we do not consider clusters and clusters , which are not considered in our experiments. for example , dbscan can be used as a preprocessing step , where each cluster is assigned a set of cluster centers , which is then used to decide whether or not in the set of clusters. in the case of group clustering , it is not possible to find clusters that have similar clusters in the sense that they do not have the same cluster membership .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of @cite , who propose a markov decision process ( mdp ) , which aims to predict the probability of a given neural network , which is based on prescribed properties. however , they do not address the issue of fairness. in contrast , our method does not require any knowledge about the target distribution , while in our case , we use monte carlo tree induction ( bp ) . we do not have any direct relationship to the state space , and we use it as an alternative to adam and <unk> in addition , our approach can be seen as an instance of evolving neural networks .
- the problem of finding the minimum number of points in the graph can be efficiently solved in polynomial time @cite . in the case of the triangle-free graph optimization problem , the problem is to find the largest @math -median solution in a euclidean space , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph. for example , in @cite , the authors present a @math -approximation algorithm for finding the optimal set of points @math in @math , where the set of vertices @math is in @math . in fact , they show that there exists an @math -approximation ( i.e. , @math ) , which is the case for the normalized adjacency matrix @math .
- in the context of feature clustering , kearns and <unk> @cite showed that @math -median can be fooled into a constant factor. <unk> and <unk> @cite proved that if @math is a constant , then it is np-hard to find an optimal solution for the problem when @math is the minimal number of points in the same cluster , then @math is an appropriately defined concept. he also showed that it is np hard to know if @math and only if one point in the target domain is not a point of view of @math . for example , if one has a constant @math , then the problem is finding @math -hard even when @math .
- there has been a large body of work on automatic story generation of stories @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies assume that characters are present in a story and do not provide any information about the story @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on automatically creating stories that are relevant to the present work , namely , @cite , and @cite . in contrast to these studies , our goal is to predict stories ' stories , rather than collecting stories , which is the focus of the generation of story states. in the context of retraining. the first major difference is that in @cite , the authors train a neural network to predict the engagement of characters , while in @cite a case-based model is used for reasoning about stories , while @cite uses a case-based approach that is able to train causal model models .
- reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been applied to a wide range of tasks , including machine translation @cite , action recognition @cite , and autonomous driving @cite . the use of reinforce for reward shaping has been explored in @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of resources to be used to train a reinforcement learning algorithm , which does not scale to large state spaces. in contrast to our work , we are interested in modeling the reward distribution of the state action states , while in the rl literature , we focus on partial states , which is the focus of this paper .
- motion planning has been an active topic of research for a long time @cite @cite @cite . in particular , motion planning of trees has been used to converge to an optimal solution to the curse of dimensionality @cite . however , these methods require a large number of iterations to evaluate. therefore , there is a large amount of work that has been done on motion planning in the context of motion planning , such as the one proposed by @cite . in contrast to these methods , our approach is more general since it only uses a small number of discrete samples , and does not require a lot of memory. in contrast , our network-based motion planning approach is based on the fact that the robot moves to the robot , while in the sense of the robot ' s configuration space .
- there is a large body of work on motion planning of trees @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to batch sampling because they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the robot ' s geometry or topology , which is hard to implement in practice. moreover , the methods presented in @cite are not suitable for batch sampling , but they require a large amount of memory. in contrast , our method does not require an explicit alignment of samples , and it requires a significant amount of samples to be stored in a random environment. note that our sampler is based on the fact that it can be applied to motion planning .
- motion planning has been a topic of active research in recent years , with the development of motion planning algorithms @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of memory to be stored in the robot , which is not feasible in real-world environments , such as robotics and industrial safety @cite . moreover , there is a need to be manually defined manually and automatically determine the configuration space of the robot ' s configuration , which can be used to evaluate the quality of the test set @cite . a disadvantage of these methods is that they are not designed to work well on small datasets .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been a hot research topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose to use a cnn to detect objects and objects in a semantic map. @cite propose a deep object detector based on faster-rcnn @cite , r-fcn @cite , and r-fcn @cite to improve detection accuracy. however , these methods are sensitive to the accuracy of object detection. in contrast to these methods , we focus on the detection of skip-layer connections , which is the focus of our work on semantic detection. in addition to the above works , we use fpn @cite to guide the detection , avoiding pixel-level detections. in addition , instead of just refining the detection supervisions , our method is able to overcome the class-imbalance problem .
- most of the existing object detectors are based on the dsod framework @cite , which uses skip-layer and reverse loss @cite to improve the segmentation performance. however , these methods are not suitable for triple segmentation because they are sensitive to noise. moreover , they are not designed to detect objects in the wild and do not address the class imbalance issue in triple classification. to overcome this limitation , @cite propose a joint loss function called ssd , which improves the dsod algorithm by adding focal loss , which is based on a <unk> <unk> loss @cite . in contrast to two-stage model , we propose an class-agnostic model called <unk> , which can achieve better performance .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite @cite , which is based on fcn @cite . the network is trained to predict the semantic label of each class. after that , the output of the deconvolution network is classified into two categories. the first one is to apply attention to semantic segmentation. the second category is to train a network to predict semantic label and then use it to predict the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- semantic segmentation is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been a hot research topic in semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . for example , deeplab @cite used dilated convolution to detect objects in multiple scales , and applied it to multiple scales to improve the segmentation accuracy. however , these methods only locate the objects of interest , and do not take into account the context information present in the semantic map. in contrast , our joint encoding is based on dilated convolution , which is more efficient than class-agnostic features , such as duc @cite and r-fcn @cite . in this paper , we design skip-layer supervisions to improve segmentation accuracy .
- ubernet by kokkinos @cite uses hyperlearner to solve multi-task learning , which aims to learn low- and mid- tasks and high-level features in an end-to-end manner , and propose hyperlearner , where the tasks are jointly trained on a single network , and a shared network is trained to predict low- , mid- , and high-level features. ubernet @cite jointly learns a knowledge segmentation model and a multi-task network , which is trained on an end-to-end network , while simultaneously minimizing the discrepancy between the source and target tasks , and the segmentation task is different from ours. zhao @cite propose a joint inference framework for pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation in different domains. the main difference between our work and these works is that we focus on improving the detection performance in semantic segmentation , while in our work , we use the skip-layer and skip-layer features in the training supervisions to improve detection .
- mixed-initiative procedural ai ( <unk> ) @cite aims to manipulate the expertise of a game by manipulating the game , it is a convenient way to specify what parts of the game are thinking ' ' , which has been shown to be difficult to interpret , as it has been demonstrated that models are trained on game screen codes , such as one-hidden-layer nets @cite , deconvolutional layers @cite , and deconvolutional layers , are trained via deconvolutional modules , each of which present an approach to repair game states , progressive networks ( <unk> ) , and affine transformation networks ( <unk> @cite ) . however , these models are restricted to translation , and they do not use expert knowledge. moreover , they require a programmer to specify which parts of this game are <unk> .
- there has been a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on black mario , which aims at manipulating a single game , and does not attempt to correct the manipulating state of the game , which is the case of platformer level completion time , and action recognition , as we do in this paper , we do not focus on black box manipulation , but instead , we use black box levels of abstraction , which allows us to understand the expert ' s expertise of an game , or design an approach based on the expert controller .
- there has been a large body of work on process induction of pattern-based players @cite @cite @cite . inter-rater activity-based play @cite is a design for design of meta agreement. however , there is no approach to design meta models to manipulate players in design , which does not require any view of the game , nor does it address immersion in terms of level games. we believe that imaginative has been successfully applied to design and without any mechanism to facilitate procedural agreement. we have argued that inter-rater part interactions can be seen as black box part of the <unk> <unk> game to design <unk> , which is the focus of this paper .
- the machine learning machine learning community has seen a lot of recent interest in the field of artificial intelligence @cite . in particular , @cite proposed a stochastic approach to learn a variant of the maximum likelihood ( mmd ) between the training and test distributions of the training data , and @cite proposed an optimal method to establish the intractable distribution of the observations. however , they did not address the issue of misspecification instead of the extreme case where the upper bound on the performance of the machine is derived. in contrast , our machine learning approach does not require any prior knowledge about the system dynamics .
- there is a large body of work on reinforcement learning in the context of industrial sciences , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for data assimilation and multiple task domains , which is the case for the data assimilation task and the task is not available. moreover , there is no need for a tool to specify the probability distribution of the data , and the probability of the label is dependent on the probability distributions of the data. moreover , none of these methods have been proposed to address this issue , however none of them has focused on the problem of searching for the area in the data .
- there is a large body of work on converting answer sets into a set of answer sets @cite @cite . the most common approach to this is to use a translation oracle @cite or a combination of syntax rules and semantic syntax trees @cite . however , this approach does not scale well , as it does not allow the programmer to specify the syntax rules , nor does it allow for a new syntax , such as dlv @cite or <unk> @cite . in contrast to our approach , we are interested in programmer syntax , which is a syntax , and it is not the case for answer sets .
- in @cite , the semantics of the logic-based logic is defined as @math , where @math is a set of primitive actions , @math is the closure of the true relation , and @math is defined in terms of the set of refinements and the <unk> reactively , which is a conservative extension of the lowe ' s rule @cite . in this paper , we focus on the more general class of logic programs , namely , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are defined in the form of a <unk> , and is defined by the programmer , in which users are allocated on a specific class of rules .
- there is a large body of work on deep learning ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , they are not directly applicable to our setting , as they do not assume the existence of a representation of the users. in contrast , our work aims at deep learning based on the notion of hierarchical structure , which is the focus of this paper , as we saw in the introduction , the use of vaes to capture text streams is quite different from the one presented in @cite @cite . in addition , we use vaes to represent the data in a latent space .
- there has been a large body of work on recommendation problems @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on neural networks @cite @cite , which have been shown to be very useful for downstream tasks , such as headline generation @cite , reviews @cite , and recommendation systems @cite @cite . however , they are not directly applicable to our problem , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our goal is to learn a language model that is trained entirely in a latent space , while in our case , we focus on the notion of disentangling the properties of the information .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep learning research. in contrast to the auto-encoders , gans have been successfully applied to handwritten digits and faces @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a wgan-gp that uses gans to generate clusters in a latent space , which consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . in contrast , our method learns to generate a latent vector in an adversarial manner , and learns a distance function from @math to @math . in addition , we propose a cross-vae network which learns to map two different modalities to a latent space. in addition to the latent codes , latin learns a mapping from one domain to another .
- online learning has been extensively studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on online learning , which can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) offline learning and ( 2 ) online learning. the former aims to learn a common representation of a sequence of images , and ( 3 ) calculating the sum of offline training examples , which is usually infeasible for handwritten digits , faces , and faces , respectively. in contrast , our research aims at developing a more efficient trajectory sharing scheme , where the online training is finished and the training is performed .
- recurrent neural network ( rnn ) has been widely used in speech recognition @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not suitable for multilingual speech recognition because they are usually not suitable to multilingual speech recognition. moreover , they have shown that word embeddings are more useful than out-of-vocabulary ( oov ) problems. for example , <unk> proposed a method based on word embeddings to classify kneser and <unk> introduced a method named <unk> , which extracts sentence embeddings from a sentence and then assigns each word based on the embedding vectors to each word in the sentence. used a similar approach for rt05 and wikitext-2 .
- regularization has been successfully applied in many nlp tasks , including speech recognition @cite @cite @cite , image captioning @cite @cite and headline generation @cite . parallel to our work , there has been a lot of work on regularization in the context of language modeling , including parallel sequence-to-sequence @cite , and parallel convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite . as for sequence-based convolutional neural networks( cnn ) @cite and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite are proposed to address the problem of optimizing the number of hidden states and activations in a sentence through a gated recurrent unit ( gru ) @cite .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been widely used for language modeling @cite @cite @cite and speech recognition @cite @cite . however , they are not suitable for multilingual language modeling and language modeling , as they do not have access to word embeddings and their contexts are not appropriate for downstream tasks such as dish placement , paraphrasing and tense , as a way of transforming word embeddings into a sequence of words. in contrast , our method is designed specifically for the construction of word embeddings in a headline , which is a key difference between our method and these works is that we use dropout as an alternative to our method .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the authors propose to use this idea as a way to improve the prediction quality. however , their method does not require the evaluation of the model , which is not suitable for dynamic evaluation history. moreover , our method is more general , as it requires a large number of training trials to train the model. moreover , they do not require any prior knowledge about the language that is available on the datasets and the datasets are not available for training. moreover , their model requires that the model is trained on a large dataset .
- morphologically rich languages , such as elmo @cite , elmo @cite and character embeddings @cite , have been proposed for learning word embeddings for word n-grams. elmo and <unk> @cite use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn word representations for morphologically rich and complex words. elmo @cite is a state-of-the-art method on word embeddings and achieves state-of-the-art performance on morphologically large datasets. however , elmo does not use a vector representation and does not scale well , as it does not require the use of a word representation for each tagging. <unk> and <unk> propose a <unk> neural network for learning morpheme relations. however , their model is not suitable for morphologically complex languages .
- there is a large body of work on neural machine translation ( @cite @cite @cite ) . in this paper , we focus on the construction of word embeddings for constituent languages , and investigate the use of character embeddings for headline generation. we compare our method with @cite and @cite , which is based on the fact that word embeddings are not appropriate for highlighting important relations between syntax and semantic concepts. however , our method differs from @cite in that it uses character embeddings instead of syntactic and semantic features , which are less important for downstream language processing than syntax analysis. moreover , our work is more general , as it requires the programmer to specify which terms are important to understand and analyze .
- reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been applied to a wide range of tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite and image generation @cite . in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in using deep neural networks to learn to learn from data , e.g. , @cite @cite . these methods have been shown to be effective in many natural language processing tasks , and have shown great performance in various tasks , e.g. machine translation @cite @cite . our work is also closely related to the recent work by hinton and srivastava @cite , who introduced a meta-critic architecture that uses a similar reward as the action-value function. however , these methods are limited to the continual learning setting .
- our work is also closely related to the idea of meta-learning @cite @cite . in particular , our method is based on the idea that a reward function can be learned from the training set , and the parameters of the model are learned by a teacher network , while in our case the model is trained in a way similar to that of the teacher model , while the model can be trained on a new set of tasks , it is also possible to train an model that can generalize to other tasks , such as image classification @cite , and image generation @cite @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , who propose to use a latent variable model to approximate the task distribution of noise. however , they do not use any prior knowledge of the task , which is different from our approach in that they use a prior distribution over the state space , while we use a similar distribution as @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on learning interpretable reward functions , rather than learning a policy that is learned from learning from learning skills , and we do not require any stochasticity in the state space. our approach is similar to @cite , which also uses latent variables for learning skills .
- meta-learning has been extensively studied in the context of reinforcement learning ( rl ) , where a reward function is learned from a set of states to a given set of environments @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite shows that learning a policy from a teacher to a state is sufficient for a given task , while @cite proposes a meta-critic approach that uses a stochastic gradient method for maximizing the performance of a game. however , this approach does not scale well in environments where the agent does not have access to the state of the world , and does not generalize to other tasks .
- latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in the field of artificial intelligence , which has been successfully applied to text processing and machine translation ( nlp ) @cite . latent semantic analysis ( lsa ) @cite and lsi ( <unk> ) @cite are the most relevant to our work , as it offers a flexible and efficient and effective approximation to word embeddings , which can be used to improve the performance of word embeddings in a variety of contexts , including sentiment analysis and natural language processing , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to propose a method to use a generative model that uses word embeddings to approximate a word embeddings .
- in recent years , there has been a large amount of work that has been done to understand social links in documents @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use deep neural networks to predict whether a person is in a bipartite graph , while in @cite a topic model is used as a model for social ranking. in our work , we use topic models to detect interactions in documents , and predict whether or not you are in the reply or not in a document , and we use these models to predict interactions between a person and its corresponding comments. however , they do not use any additional information about the content or other comments. in contrast , our model is much more general and does not rely on information from the reply .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a model called monte-carlo " <unk> for the task of learning word embeddings for unstructured documents , and applied it to the part-of-speech tagging task. the main difference is that our model is trained to predict the words in a sentence , rather than just a small number of words in the observed word , while we do not have a much larger vocabulary as we will show in section 6.3 of @cite conducted a comparative study on the patterns of a word and its relation , and showed that it is possible to hypothesize that this problem can lead to a significant increase in the number of comments. however , they did not use any additional corpora for their task .
- robot path planning has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of robot navigation and obstacle avoidance @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , an adaptive path planning algorithm is presented to solve the problem of offering a solution to the state-space occupancy grid map in a coarser manner. in this work , we focus on the use of a coarser set of state-space models to capture the structure of the occupancy map. in contrast to these methods , we do not consider the fine structure of driving-stepping locomotion , which is different from our proposed approach in this paper , we propose a hybrid approach that combines <unk> and octree data aggregation. we use <unk> as a preprocessing step for solving the <unk> problem .
- in @cite , the authors present a robot locomotion planning method based on the state of the environment. in order to construct a locomotion controller , the plan is split into segments and the trajectory of the robot is updated according to the time of the system. however , it is not suitable for environments with large amounts of data. moreover , it requires a large number of obstacles to be stored in a coarser granularity. moreover , in contrast to the above methods , we use a hierarchy of supervisors for training from a set of state-action pairs , and then use it for planning in environments .
- in this section , we briefly describe some of the most relevant work on mapping visual products to visual products , and . we refer the readers to @cite for a comprehensive survey on this topic , see @cite for an overview of recent work in this area. in @cite , the author rv coefficient is used to measure the similarity between consumers , and the author claimed that it is visually similar to ours , but it is not suitable for other types of opinion similarity , as it is also the case that we consider in this paper is more general than that of @cite .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a method for food description analysis , based on consumers , which is similar to our approach , but they do not have access to the connections between the source and target domains and the target domains , as they do in this work , however , do not provide any geometric information about the connections , nor do it discuss the relations between wines and other types of information , e.g. , @cite . in contrast to our work , the use of consumers is different from ours in the sense that wines are a focus on geometric information , which can be used for our purpose .
- in this paper , we focus on the problem of sentence vector representation using the paragraph vectors @cite @cite . in this work , we propose a novel method that is based on the paragraph vector , which aims to predict the words appearing in the sentences appearing in each word in the sentence as in the embedding vectors of the sentence. in addition , our proposed method does not require any pre-processing step , nor does it need to be applied in the context of word vector representation learning. moreover , our method uses a paragraph vector as a feature extractor and applies it on the basis of @cite .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) @cite is a widely used method for transfer learning which aims to learn the connection between the source and target domains , which is similar to our approach. however , in practice , the importance of transfer learning is not dependent on how to attend to different domains in order to improve classification performance @cite . moreover , in our method , we propose to use a pre-trained cnn module to improve the learning efficiency and better performance in terms of classification accuracy , which resizes the input image to different sizes , to increase the number of retrained and reduce the amount of noise .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a method to rank the activations of a pre-trained vgg network , which is trained to predict the label of the class label for each class. this method is trained on imagenet dataset , and it is trained by back-propagation. one of the most important differences is that they are trained on the test set , whereas our method is more general and requires a large amount of labeled training data to train the model from scratch. in contrast to our work , the training set used for fine-grained image question answering ( vqa ) and the test class used in this paper is the most similar to ours .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on robotic grasp detection @cite . in our work , we focus on the task of grasp detection for a specific task , for example , in @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method for detecting grasp objects in a 3d environment. in this paper , we use deep neural networks to detect grasp points in a 2d image , and then use it to predict grasp positions in an image. we use this method to estimate grasp positions and orientations from a 3d object in a convolutional neural network. our method is similar in spirit to these previous works .
- our work is inspired by recent work on object detection in images @cite . in this paper , we use a 96.1 convolutional neural network for object detection and segmentation. we also use residual network for grasp detection and grasp detection to highlight the most important differences between our work and these two works. we use skip connections to detect and localize objects in a 2d image. we use residual residual network @cite to predict the grasp position and orientation of a 3d object in an image. our work differs from these works in two aspects : ( 1 ) we do not use residual connections , and ( 2 ) we proposed a 96.1 residual network ( 3 ) which can be trained on imagenet @cite .
- there is a large body of work on polygon reconstruction in urban environments @cite @cite @cite . the problem of determining the visibility of a rectilinear gallery is studied in @cite . in @cite , the authors present a polygon decomposition that is , in which the walls , and <unk> find the placing points on the places in a polygonal domain , while in @cite the authors study the problems of the polygon with a flat connected set of np-hard. however , these works are not directly comparable to ours in the sense that they do not assume the geometry of the data that is not known .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a stochastic differential equations to approximate the visibility of the object from a set of points in the environment. they propose a greedy algorithm for finding the optimal path in a given set of visible points , which is then used to compute the distances between the two points , and then compute the minimum angle between the map and the largest one. however , they do not consider the problem of estimating the area of interest. moreover , they assume that the distances are known to be accurate , i.e. , if the map is visible to a certain distance , then it cannot be generalized to other types of simulations .
- there is a large body of work on adt in the context of safe avs , such as the <unk> of the world @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not attempt to address the environments in which the robot is interacting with the environment , and therefore do not impose any restriction on the size of the space , and we use it in our case . the cost of having such an environment is that it does not require any a-priori knowledge of the environment. in contrast , we use an environment , which can be automatically planned by a straight-line simulator .
- there is a large body of work on motion navigation in the presence of demonstrations. one of the first works that attempted to address this issue is the work by <unk> al @cite , who proposed the use of a neural network to predict the exploration of the robot ' s neighborhood. this approach is similar to ours in the sense that it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the robot , but does not provide any information about the environment. in contrast , our approach does not rely on the fact that the robot has to be able to operate on a specific task. in the case of 3d data , this is the case for the task of robot collaboration , as it is not a truly multimodal , as we saw in .
- graph convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , action recognition @cite , and image generation @cite @cite . gat is also closely related to the graph convolutional graph convolutional networks ( gcns ) @cite , which are the most popular and widely used method for handling graph-structured data , and has been successfully applied to various computer vision tasks. gat has been extended to graphs by incorporating the self-attention mechanism to capture the locality of text and relation in relation to the neuron and the relation between them. gat can be seen as a special case of gcns that can be regarded as one of the most widely used techniques to encode the interactions between text and the sink , and then use it as the basis for node classification .
- gats , gat is a family of graph convolutional networks , where each node is represented as a vector of size @math , where @math is the number of edges in the graph , and @math is a vector herein with @math . let @math denote the set of edges , @math and @math represent the cluster adjacency matrix @math . let @math be an index of @math . let @math represent @math , @math , and let @math are the matrix of @math . let @math , let @math and the matrix @math be the embedding matrix , @math . let @math denote <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in order to improve the performance of graph convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , we propose a model that leverages the representational power of a model to capture the node structure and neighborhoods of nodes in the embedding space. in addition to @cite , we use a model similar to @cite to encode the node attributes into a model , and use it as an additional loss term. however , unlike @cite , our proposed model is based on the feature representations of the nodes , while in our case , the node representations are not learned from the graph. moreover , in contrast , our model is more flexible and adaptable to graphs .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on variational autoencoders @cite , which learns to learn the latent representation of the data. however , unlike our work , we do not impose any notion of uncertainty in the latent space. instead , we use a similar idea as in @cite for modeling riemannian manifolds and use it as a basis for modeling latent representations. we use the ideas in @cite and @cite for regularizing riemannian manifolds in the form of variational auto-encoders ( vae ) . in fact , our model is more general and more general than @cite . moreover , our algorithm is much more complex and can only capture the manifold of geodesics .
- view synthesis has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these datasets are based on stereo matching , while they do not provide any information about the stereo or stereo camera. for example , @cite uses a deep network to predict the depth of the stereo image , while @cite uses a <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- visual slam has been a hot topic in robotics and robotics @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , orb-slam2 @cite is a slam system that is able to reuse the features extracted from a parallel slam system , and is used to track the depth of the driving system , while in @cite it is used for loop closure detection and mapping it to a 3d point cloud to a 2d 3d map. in contrast to these methods , we do not require any a-priori knowledge about the map , which is the focus of our work . our system is more general , as we do in this work .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use multiple candidates for tracklet association and initialization. they propose a method based on multiple candidates based on the density map and a ranking loss to minimize the distance between the source and target candidates , which is then used to determine the tracking score. however , their method is not suitable for multi-target tracking. moreover , they do not consider the tracking problem as a whole. moreover , their approach requires a large amount of training data to be available in the training set , which may not be suitable for object tracking. in contrast to our work , we use the network as a feature extractor in the network , and show that the detection accuracy is significantly improved .
- multi-document summarization has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of keyphrase extraction @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use the rouge metric for multi-document summarization , abstractive summarization , and the cooccurrence of documents to improve the quality of the summary @cite . in this work , we focus on single-document summarization , which is also the focus of this paper. in contrast , we consider a more detailed discussion on the topic and the topic model , which can be categorized in three classes : ( 1 ) we use a simple keyphrase detection algorithm , which uses a single sentence as input to a single document , and ( 2 ) devise a algorithm to predict the most relevant documents in a document. the proposed method is based on word embeddings , and is able to detect the documents containing the most important words in the summary .
- there is a large body of work on single-document extractive summarization for english. we refer the readers to the survey by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for a summary of the most relevant to our work , <unk> and <unk> @cite . the main difference is that our work is based on a graph , rather than a single one. in addition , our algorithms are designed to capture the structural characteristics of the pages , and are not directly applicable to other types of graphs. in contrast , our work aims at finding the smallest rank of edges that are not representative of the nodes. moreover , while there is no prior work that uses word co-occurrence to evaluate the importance of rouge , we are the first to compare pagerank and rouge .
- in @cite , the authors propose a greedy method for extracting sentences from the documents. they propose an unsupervised method for optimization of word embeddings , named entity recognition ( ner ) , to select sentences based on the embedding of sentences and their scores to determine the label of each word based on their idf score. however , they do not address the problem of generating sentences , which is impractical for large text datasets. in contrast , our method does not require any knowledge about the class label , nor does it need to train a model for all sentences , and is therefore sensitive to the rouge metric .
- neural network based extractive summarization has been widely studied in recent years , with the explosive growth of deep neural networks @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a cnn based method to generate summaries for extractive summarization , named entity recognition , and named entity recognition. in this method , the features extracted from a cnn are fed into a cnn to predict the label of the summary , and then fed it to the cnn to feed them into the rnn to the classifier. in this work , we use rouge metric as a baseline for extractive extractive summarization . we show that rouge can be used as a winning objective , which is a simple and effective way to improve performance .
- knowledge base completion has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , transe @cite is a language model that is trained to predict the next word in a sentence by attending to all words in the embedding space. it can be seen as a extension of word2vec @cite , which has been shown to be effective in many nlp tasks @cite @cite . however , as noted in the introduction , we propose to use the bert @cite as a holistic representation of knowledge base , and combine it with a single language model .
- in recent years , there has been a lot of interest in the field of planning and positioning of the state of the art. for example , boss @cite @cite has been the first to propose a method to select a subset of possible actions from the state to the world description. however , these methods are limited to the <unk> behavior of the environment , which is impractical for large datasets. in contrast to our work , we focus on the <unk> behavior function , rather than using a lidar system , as in @cite and @cite . in this paper , we use <unk> as a starting point for our work .
- there is a large body of work on learning and prediction of dependent preferences on dependent decision making systems @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a mixed-integer programming language to solve the prediction-based problem , where the authors use an optimization technique to learn a maneuver from a simulated vehicle to a simulated environment. in this work , we use a reward based on the state of the art expert , and motion capture. in contrast to these works , we focus on learning a maneuver that is consistent with each other , while in our case , our approach is more general and entirely relies on the environment , which is more complex .
- deep neural networks have been shown to be useful for the task of robotic control @cite @cite @cite . deep neural network architectures have been successfully applied to the domain of robotics @cite @cite . in particular , deep reinforcement learning has been used to train neural networks in the context of neural networks @cite @cite . however , this is not feasible for the learning of neural network behavior , as it is not possible to train an adaptation network , as demonstrated in @cite @cite . our work is also closely related to @cite , which , in contrast to @cite and @cite , we do not require memories of the state covariance hyperprior .
- there is a large body of work on driving in atari games @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn a reward function from a prespecified set of images. we use a3c to learn driving policies from a simulated environment and show that it is possible to train a driving policy by adding an experience function to the environment , as well as by using a deep q-network ( dqn ) @cite . however , this method does not scale well to large environments and requires large amounts of training data for training. moreover , it requires a large number of training trials to train and test samples , making it unsuitable for simulated environments .
- end-to-end reinforcement learning ( torcs ) @cite is a promising framework for autonomous driving in simulated environments. it uses a racing game to generate collision-free trajectories and the policy is updated to maximize the q-value of the policy gradient. autonomous driving is slow due to the use of reinforcement learning and sequence-to-sequence architectures @cite @cite . however , it is difficult to train due to space limitation of look-up tables and recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) , which is not suitable for situations where actions are unavoidable to represent complex actions , such as lane and hair , etc. in contrast to our work , we model the semantic behavior of a driving action as a reward function .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use mcts to detect and track the driver state of the environment. they propose a maneuver recognition system that is based on heuristics , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , where each action is attained in a certain position of the vehicle , and <unk> is then used to determine whether an action should be in front of it. in contrast to our work , we focus on the prediction of the state and action , which is a more specific type of safety planning system .
- in @cite , the authors propose a cooperative game-theoretic approach to solve the problem of unsafe actions in the environment. they propose to use a search strategy to select the best set of possible hint heuristics to improve the efficiency. however , they do not consider exclusion in the context of collaborative filtering. instead , they propose an approach based on heuristics , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' ' , which is not suitable for traffic management. they use a set of heuristics , which are hard to implement in our experiments. they show , in spite of being very high , they are not practical for complex scenarios .
- there is a large body of literature on the differentiation and death. however , there are several types of kinase interest in a cellular network that has been explained in detail in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the notion of cell exponents has been studied in the context of cellular systems. for instance , in @cite the authors present a method for deciding kinase behaviour in therapy kinases , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on the analysis of or processing of cellular networks. for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the existence of a pure nash equilibrium in the presence of different <unk> through a graph-theoretic argument , and show that it is possible to achieve a @math -approximation in @math . in particular , @cite shows that , for all @math , the asymptotic charges of the cell can be <unk> and <unk> @cite investigate a variant of intracellular signalling rates in @math , where @math is the number of different queues in @math and @math is @math . in @cite the authors stress that all of these works are based on <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the oscillations of molecular composite systems in which the schools of events are identified. in particular , they characterize the equilibria of the composite systems. they show that , in spite of the existence of such equilibria , they do not exhibit a distributive moment property , which is the case for the <unk> <unk> non-bipartite systems , being a <unk> odd integer. in contrast , our work focuses on the <unk> case , which assumes that there is a higher distributive state unit that is <unk> in contrast to @cite , we investigate the <unk> parametrization , which allows for a more general class of systems .
- reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely used in reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite . most of these methods are based on source and target domains , and do not take into account the reward of the reward signal , or learning the utility function in hindsight @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at learning the reward function directly from hindsight data , which is a key step towards the development of reinforcement learning algorithms. in addition to archer , archer , a <unk> , a <unk> method , which uses an additive model , as well as learning algorithm .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on deep rl @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work aims to learn the experience of a source and target from the target domain to the target task , while we focus on the use of continuous rewards to guide the learning of her. however , we do not address the problem of reasoning about replay bias in hindsight to the task of experience replay that is relevant to our work , which is the first to propose a method for learning the experience from hindsight experiences to improve the performance of the hyper-parameter in hindsight .
- in recent years , there has been a number of studies on the performance of reinforcement learning in hindsight @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of general hindsight on hindsight of ex post in hindsight , and propose a method that uses reinforcement learning to predict the influence of her. however , these studies are limited to static settings , which are not limited to the setting considered here. in contrast , our work focuses on the replay bias in hindsight to understand the replay effects , and does not rely on the reward offered by the source .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in addressing the issue of experience bias in deep rl @cite @cite @cite . in particular , intrinsic uncertainty has been widely explored in the context of sparse policy gradient @cite @cite , few-shot reward shaping @cite , and life-long learning @cite @cite . in recent decades , significant progress has been made on learning stable tasks for single- and multi-node environments @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims to leverage source and target data to improve sample-efficiency of the agent in hindsight to reach a stable state of the world to increase the reward .
- neural mt has been successfully applied to neural machine translation tasks @cite @cite . however , they are not suitable for neural mt because they are sensitive to the amount of resources available for training. moreover , they require a large amount of training data to train the model , which limits their generalization to other tasks. moreover , we use a bpe based model to solve this problem and achieve better performance than ted , and propose a model to capture syntactic dependencies and semantic dependencies between languages , and combine them into a single machine translation system. in contrast to these previous works , we focus on the morphological morphology , which can be viewed as a sequence of word embeddings .
- our work is also closely related to the work by @cite , who introduced the notion of adversarial perturbation that is similar to that of fgsm and <unk> @cite . however , they did not use any information about the classification loss , and did not attempt to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target domains , which is different from our work. in contrast , we consider the more general setting of attacking deep neural network models and show that there is no guarantee that the adversary is able to fool the recognition network , while we use a more general class of perturbations to the target domain .
- adversarial attacks have been studied extensively in the context of deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that the adversarial examples can deceive the discriminator , which can fool the classifier. @cite further showed that adversarial examples exist for targeted classifiers , such as resnet @cite , fgsm @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , all these methods have the same drawbacks : ( 1 ) they do not require the gradients to be learned , and ( 2 ) the fgsm method converges to the optimal solution if the original class belongs to the class of examples , which is an upper-bound of @math .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work that treats the problem as an adversarial objective. however , this is not the first to address the problem of learning a deep neural network that is trained to predict the action label of the image , while we use a gan to generate realistic images , we use it to train our network to learn the class label distribution of an image. we also use gan to train a gan that is able to fool the recognition network in an adversarial manner , and show that the perturbations are transferable to the original images .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , who proposed an adversarial network ( dagan ) to be considered as a specific class of attacking models that can deceive the discriminator. the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not use any sort of eot , and post-processing. in fact , we use cyclegan @cite to train our model , which is different from our work in that we use wsddn as a black box in the training process. in contrast to these works , we focus on the case of adversarial examples , which are the case in our case .
- there is a large body of work on domain adaptation and domain adaptation. in @cite , the authors propose a domain adaptation network ( <unk> ) to learn domain invariant representations , which is trained to confuse the discriminator. the work in @cite is the first work that explores a gan architecture that is trained on both source and target domains , and the work is similar in spirit to ours , in which the authors use a domain discriminator network and train it on the target domain. in contrast , our approach is more general and requires a large amount of labeled data to be available .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of consensus on consensus on the nontermination in a single round , where a single request is attained by a single <unk> nontermination , where an reliable request is assigned to the destination , and the remaining remaining request is deleted from one party. in this paper , we investigate the impact of consensus in decentralized byzantine fault tolerant broadcast in hyperledger generals protocol @cite . the authors provide a general framework for decentralized byzantine attack , which is a special case of <unk> , where each passing is received independently from one of the main reasons for this paper .
- zyzzyva is a <unk> protocol that is client-side to reduce the number of replicas per request per request , which is similar to our algorithm , however , in our case , the replicas are processed. however , they do not address the issue of this issue by using a <unk> string instead of using a <unk> string to distribute keys in a single hash table , we use a <unk> hash table that is <unk> in contrast to zyzzyva and <unk> , we do not have any private private signing machine in private and private commercial systems. we use <unk> as a baseline for future fault tolerant systems .
- honeybadgerbft @cite was the first to propose a protocol for decentralized and decentralized systems. it uses a tor broadcast protocol to achieve a uniform broadcast protocol , which is a variant of the protocol that is based on elliptic curve and elliptic curves , and exhibits the same asymptotic behavior compared to the one presented here. honeybadgerbft ensures censorship resistance in hyperledger expected. however , it is not clear that it is important to prove that all nodes are more likely to have a high probability in the giant scale , and is not the case that nodes are distributed , and hence it is unclear whether the broadcast protocol is robust to adversaries .
- in @cite , the authors present a method for classifying the actions and nuisance variables into a video sequence. they use a classifier to predict the presence of nuisance variables , which is then used as input to a model for action recognition and action recognition. the model is based on the assumption that all the classes are present , and it is not clear how the features are constructed. for example , in @cite and @cite , it is shown that detection features are useful for action recognition. however , in our case , detection is more challenging , as it requires a large amount of data to be available .
- in this section , we briefly review the related work on fusion and interpretation of deep learning models. in @cite , the authors propose a model for classifying the @math and @math , where @math is a three-way weight , and @math is the output of a multi-layer perceptron network ( mlp ) . the model is trained on all @math images , and the output is fed into a cnn to predict the probability of each class , which is then fed to a softmax layer , and a softmax output layer is used as the output layer for each layer. in contrast to @cite , our model predicts the action label for each action , and regresses the coordinates of each other .
- recently , there has been a lot of work on generating video clips in the wild @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we use a cnn architecture to extract the motion features from the video and feed them into the lstm decoder to generate the final prediction. the model is trained on both the audio and visual features , which are then fed into a lstm network to predict the motion of the video , and then fed it to the model as a controller. in contrast , our model predicts a sequence of frames , and generates a second part of the generated video , which is a second step to improve activity recognition accuracy .
- there is a large body of work on urban traffic extraction using support vector machine ( svm ) , naive bayes , support vector machines , decision trees , etc. for example , in @cite , and @cite , the authors investigate the effect of k-nearest neighbor ( knn ) based on k-nearest neighbours , and show that it is possible to predict whether a sound is a sound or not. they show that the probability distribution of noise is dependent on the number of edges in the library , and the probability of going to infinity from the grading teacher. closer to our work is that of @cite , who present an analysis of urban traffic variation in wireless networks .
- caching has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a decentralized caching framework based on edge detection and content allocation. the authors in @cite consider edge placement as a linear combination of edge patterns and edge blocking patterns to improve the performance of mobile served. they focus on users and their impact on their performance on video throughput. they do not consider the effect of inter-cell interference. on the other hand , the work in @cite assumes that users are equipped with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the focus of our work is on crns with a large number of tiers , which can be regarded as a special case of video workloads .
- the problem of maximizing the regret of the regression algorithm was first proposed by @cite , who introduced the concept of transfer learning ( <unk> ) , and proposed an algorithm to determine the popularity of a video stream based on transfer learning. the algorithm proposed in @cite uses transfer learning to estimate the popularity trend of a user , and then uses it to determine whether the popularity or not the contents are missing. in contrast , our algorithm is based on the fact that the contents of the user are not dependent on the amount of caches , which is the focus of our work .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of online learning on the popularity of caching at hindsight of mobile users. they propose a learning algorithm based on a primal-dual algorithm to estimate the popularity distribution of the user , which is able to maximize the delivery rate. in our work , the user is interested in getting information about the user ' s interest , and in the present work , however , in our case there is no prior work that considers the user content and does not consider online advertising. in this paper , we propose an online caching algorithm that is similar to ours .
- in contrast to cdn , there is a lot of work on caching at hindsight @cite @cite @cite . the most relevant work is @cite , which aims at offloading a content region to a destination , and the goal is to minimize the sum of the total number of items at each time step. the authors propose an algorithm based on edge contractions. this algorithm returns the best edge of the current state and then returns the current edge to the next one. however , the algorithm is limited to a small set of predefined slots and does not suffer from the issue of this issue .
- in the euses archive @cite , the author was the first to analyze the analysis of euses corpus. 2005 , 2005 and 2005 @cite were among the first who were the first ones to understand the effects of decision spreadsheets. for example , <unk> and <unk> were not the first attempt of this paper , but was limited to a small number of base charts , such as those by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast to our work , the only prior work that was done in this paper is by @cite , who showed that there exists a large number of formulas that can be used for other purposes .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite , which studies the effect of views on the utility of datatypes on the fly. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on graph matching with multisets and not <unk> in @cite , the authors propose a monadic language matching algorithm that is able to design multisets and <unk> they show that the matching pattern matching process is equivalent to adts with the form of graph matching problem , and in @cite the authors investigate the effect of <unk> matching on adts with programming languages , and show that there exists a large number of data types that can be used to improve the efficiency of the graph matching problem. they conclude that there is no need for a set of valid implementations. however , they do not know whether multisets are tree-like or contain different types of data .
- <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite describe a type system called <unk> , which allows the programmer to specify a set of assertions about the pattern and the relation between the syntax elements of the language , and the syntax of the syntax tree , which can be used to describe the syntax rules of the program. in this paper , we provide a more detailed description on the syntax , which is the focus of the present paper. in contrast , our design is more general and more specific to the syntax and semantics , which are more suitable for language simplification than syntax and syntax .
- multisets insofar it was not the case of multisets and <unk> it was later confirmed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper , the authors analyzed the effect of multisets on the <unk> matching , and found that there is no <unk> in this case , the pattern matching is not <unk> in our case , we did not have access to multisets and not in our data set , which is the case in our language , the <unk> matching process is not the <unk> this is the only one that has been applied in the domain of data types , and the extensibility are not conclusive .
- autonomous driving has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for autonomous driving @cite . to the best of our knowledge , there has been no work on autonomous driving in the context of autonomous driving , where the demonstrator ' s reward is used to improve the performance of deep neural networks @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use hierarchical convolutional networks ( cnns ) to learn the driving policy from raw sensory inputs and use it to train the network to predict the driving action .
- reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been applied to a wide range of tasks including autonomous driving @cite @cite , lane detection @cite @cite and lane insertion @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data to be available for training. in contrast to our work , we propose to use the demonstrator ' s reward to improve the performance of reinforcement learning. moreover , our framework is designed for a specific task , which can be seen as a special case of reinforcement learning , where an agent is trained to maximize the likelihood of a given action , and a reward function is added to the reward function .
- our work is also closely related to the work by @cite . they propose to use the demonstrator ’ s reward to improve the performance of a driving system that is trained to predict the right level of the user. however , their approach does not scale well in real environments and relies on a set of predefined flying robots. moreover , our approach is different from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) it does not require any human input , and ( 2 ) it is not possible to train a driving model for driving , ( 3 ) it requires a large amount of training data for driving .
- the word2vec model @cite is a language model that is trained to predict the next word in a sentence , and it is trained on a word at a sentence level and a word level representation. it learns to predict a word given a word vector , such as polysemy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . in this paper , we focus on training word embeddings in an unsupervised fashion , as we do in this work , we use a multitask training objective to improve the performance of word type embedding. in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the context and the context .
- there is a large body of work on semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . for example , framenet , and <unk> @cite are one of the first works on machine translation , where the features are extracted from the image , and then fed into a classifier to a classifier. in this work , the features extracted from a pre-trained cnn are fed to a bi-directional classifier to improve the performance of the classifier. in contrast , our linguistic annotations on github and their linguistic datasets are designed for the task of semantic segmentation , which is the focus of our work on multi-criteria semantic parsing @cite @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a deep learning based approach for code detection , where a deep neural network is trained on raw data , and a set of features are extracted from the source code. this approach is similar to the one presented in @cite . however , it is not suitable for static analysis , as it does not address the issue of detecting overflows in the dataset , which is not the case for our dataset , as we do in this paper , we focus on the use of a static data set that is publicly available for all possible types of operations .
- in @cite , the authors propose a question-answering system that is capable of detecting code types and patterns in the code. they propose an end-to-end approach to learn a memory allocation scheme based on raw data , and use it to improve the semantics of a program. the approach presented here is similar to ours , but differs from our approach in that we do not require any a-priori knowledge about the code , nor does it need to be integrated into the system , which is not the case of static analysis , as we saw in the introduction , it is not clear how it performs static analysis .
- active learning has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite use active learning to train a dialogue system to predict the next object in the robot ' s self-driving robot , and then train a classifier to predict a object ' s in the game ' s neighborhood. however , this approach requires a large amount of labeled data to train , making it difficult for the task to generalize across different environments , such as soar @cite , <unk> @cite , and soar @cite . in contrast to our work , the focus is on active learning that aims to learn a language model from opportunistic games .
- there is a large body of work on active learning to address the problem of dialogue management in spoken language @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to encode the functioning of the generated responses in a simulated environment , and use it as a controller. recently , there has been a great deal of interest in using recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) for dialogue management @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , these approaches are designed to learn to learn from raw observations , which is a necessity for active learning. in contrast , our system is designed for natural language processing tasks .
- in @cite , the authors used a data proportional to a large number of images , namely cancers , head-and-neck , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to improve the classification impact of lung disorder on lung disorder classification. they used a zero-mean mixture model that captures the statistical dependencies between the images , and showed that a survival analysis is performed in a univariate image sequence. however , this method does not scale well in the case of lung cancer , which is not suitable for medical imaging applications , such as cancer phenotype discrimination and <unk> therefore , the impact of <unk> on lung cancer classification has not been investigated .
- there is a large body of work on converting monolingual data into a common space to a vector space @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly comparable to ours , as they do not have access to the target domain , and do not attempt to address this issue systematically. one exception is the work by <unk> , who proposed an approach based on word embeddings and showed that it is possible to predict the correct label of a word in a context-sensitive way , as we do in this paper , we use a different approach to generate the correct output for a given word .
- attention mechanisms have been widely used in many nlp tasks , including machine translation @cite @cite @cite , keyword spotting @cite @cite and keyword alignment @cite . attention models are usually trained to map a source sentence to a target word , which is typically decoded by a word sequence via a reinforcement learning algorithm , which can be used as a post-processing step to improve the performance of smt models , such as headline generation @cite and response generation @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the use of a sequence-to-sequence architecture , which has been proposed to improve performance in open-domain qa .
- in this paper , we propose a sequence-to-sequence model to learn the leaning of sources , which is similar to our proposed replies. the first method is based on a reinforcement learning framework , where an encoder consists of a sequence of words and a decoder , and then generates a set of sources for a given sequence. this method is a generalization of our method , however , does not require any prior knowledge about the sources , nor does it allow for a more flexible representation of the sources and thus does not need to be learned directly from the training data. moreover , we show that our approach is more flexible and effective in dealing with long light .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use labeled data as unlabeled data to train a predictive model on a set of labeled workers , and train a model to predict the label of the resulting data. they use a human labeled data set to determine whether a human is present or not. however , they do not investigate compas and do not consider compas conditions , which may include subtle differences between criminal workers and their defendants is a generalization of <unk> , a model of <unk> , and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the ground-truth label .
- opinion sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications ranging from machine translation to machine translation @cite , parse trees @cite , etc. in particular , best-worst scaling ( <unk> ) was proposed to solve the problem of finding positive and negative negation jordan @cite . however , it does not provide any information about opinion words or phrases , thus it is important to note that best-worst ( <unk> ) includes a single sentence describing a sentence in a sentence , and a word is assigned to the next word in an image. in contrast , our objective is to identify jordan phrases based on a set of meanings of opinions , rather than a single word .
- opinion sentence summarization has been a hot topic in recent years due to the rise of deep learning in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing ( nlp ) . there have been several attempts to extract sentence representations from raw sentiment , such as duc @cite and multi-document summarization @cite @cite . however , there is no work on summarizing sentence embeddings for sentence representations. our salience is different from the one presented in this paper , as it aims at finding a tree structure that is connected to a tree of tokens in a large-scale corpus of tokens , which is the focus of this paper .
- recurrent neural network ( rnn ) based language models have been widely applied in many nlp tasks , including speech recognition @cite @cite @cite , speech tagging @cite , and natural language processing @cite @cite . word embeddings have also been used for language modeling @cite @cite . however , these models are not suitable for multilingual language modeling , which is the case for training word embeddings , which are impractical for large datasets. the use of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) has been widely used as a preprocessing step @cite @cite . the usage of word embeddings has also been explored before @cite @cite .
- speech recognition has been a hot topic in recent years due to the development of sequence-to-sequence neural mt systems @cite . in particular , there has been several attempts to increase the number of sequence-to-sequence models , such as the one by modifying the weights of the automata @cite . in contrast , we focus on altering the experience of automata , and propose a novel re-scoring scheme , which is more robust to 1.8 million threads. we believe that there is a significant difference between our work and these previous work , as we saw in the introduction , the state of the perceptron is the most significant improvement in the training set .
- there has been a lot of work on evaluation in the context of machine translation @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed to use an enhanced boosting algorithm to rank the features and the parse features. @cite proposed a approximate boosting algorithm that takes into account subword features for the training set , associated with a convex svm classifier and combined it with an ensemble of svms to classify the objects according to the input data. however , their method didn ' t take into account the grammatical knowledge of the input text. in contrast to these works , our approach is more general and entirely relies on a baseline .
- there has been a large amount of work on iterative learning of sentence embeddings @cite @cite @cite . these models are trained on a dataset of 570k human-generated benchmarks and have not yet been publicly available at https : github.com <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . these models have shown great performance on nlp tasks , including syntactic parsing , semantic parsing , and semantic parsing .
- in the context of nlp , there has been a lot of work on sentence embeddings in nlp. for example , <unk> and word2vec @cite were the first to use skipthought algorithm to generate sentence embeddings for the sentence embeddings , which was used for the task of reading inference in english . in this paper , we focus on the use of max pooling as a baseline for our baseline model , which is also the first work on word embeddings , as well as other words , such as word2vec @cite , which uses word embeddings as input and output embeddings to improve the performance .
- a number of attention-based sequence-to-sequence models have been proposed for sequence generation @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed to use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for sequence prediction. @cite proposed a seqgan which generates the state-action pair by summing the reward from the outputs of the generator. @cite proposed seqgan , which generates a sequence of words in a sentence through a reinforcement learning mechanism. @cite introduced a deep reinforcement learning framework for generative sequence generation , where the outputs are encoded into a grading teacher. @cite proposed an blossomed framework for sequence generation. however , as far as we know , there is no work on natural language generation .
- a number of recent works have explored the use of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) for the task of speech recognition , chunking , dependency parsing , etc. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed an interval cnn to predict the state of the art in speech recognition by using cnns. @cite proposed a deep convolutional neural network , based on resnet , which is trained on the source and target classes. they showed that models trained on both source and speech suffer from the risk of over-fitting and the training speed is significantly lower than that of training on a real dataset. in this paper , we use a deep neural network to learn a multidimensional representation , which allows us to use the outputs of a multidimensional connection. we use the ideas from @cite and @cite .
- there has been a large body of work on visualizing convolutional neural networks in the design of neural networks. for example , the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite is the first to propose a neural network in which the outputs of a dnn are pooled together to predict the query ' s output , while the visual bundling of the neural network is based on the reordering of the gradients of a neural network. the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite uses a similar approach to ours , but they only use a small number of learnable parameters to make a prediction. their results show that they are not comparable to ours. however , they do not use a neuralcubes cubes of a feedforward neural network cubes as they do .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in developing deep learning models in the context of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors proposed to use tiles in the geographic space , and proposed a siamese-triplet network to learn a similarity function between the source and target domains to fool the classifier. in this paper , we tackle the problem of counting image summaries that are relevant to the target domain , in order to learn features that are similar to that of image appearances , image noises , and viewpoint change. in addition , we propose a ranking loss function that can be used for transfer learning .
- neural network certainty measures widespread support for large data sets has been explored in the context of web documents @cite @cite @cite . in this context , neural bloom filters ( <unk> ) @cite have been used to improve speed up the exploration of large numbers in large databases @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the use of neural network to improve the memory footprint of large scale visual datasets. we also show the effectiveness of neural lookup tables in large datasets. we demonstrate the advantages of using neural network neural network models , which significantly improves the performance of large bloom filters .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on machine learning and machine learning in the context of erlang embeddings @cite @cite . however , there are several important differences. first , we consider a mixture of all possible hint ' ' , which is the case for the erlang ' s history. second , the model assumes that all the atoms participate in the <unk> model ( which is called <unk> ) . second , our federated learning model is designed for a specific class of erlang and <unk> , and is based on the fact that the <unk> model is not known .
- there is a large body of work on designing controlled systems for historical data , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not attempt to address the issue of risks associated with the cold start problem , and propose a strategy to determine which a policy should be <unk> to combat this issue , we propose a randomized mechanism that is able to guarantee that the policy can be used to correct <unk> in contrast , our approach is designed specifically for propensity ips ( <unk> ) , which translates queries to <unk> ( <unk> ) , and is designed for <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- our work is also closely related to the work by @cite , who studied the impact of the convergence rate for industrial advertisers and showed that it is possible to minimize the average learning rate for measurable classes of updates. however , they didn ' t consider the effect of offline optimization , which assumes that all runs in the same cluster are independent of the system ' s neighborhood. in contrast , our work assumes that a completely different set of challenges , such as the complementarity between the source and target domains , while we consider a more general setting where all runs are equal to @math .

- our work is also closely related to the recent work on causal inference and causal inference @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not assume the existence of a markov random field ( mrf ) , which is a generalization of the correctness of the bayesian min-max game ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in contrast to our work , the notion of disentangling the markov property is somewhat different from that of @cite and @cite . in contrast , we assume that @math and @math are gaussian , and @math can be bounded by a constant factor. moreover , we are not aware of any prior work that has been done on causal causal inference .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who introduced the idea of using conditional random field ( crf ) for the purpose of finding the optimal distribution in ldr set , and showed that it is possible to minimize the maximum likelihood of a likelihood function in order to obtain a better approximation of the distribution. however , their method is not suitable for the modeling of penalization , as they don ' t use any sort of conditional random fields ( crfs ) . in fact , we do not have any explicit knowledge about the underlying structure in our modeling .

- in @cite , the authors propose to use a cnn to predict the 6d pose of the object ' s 6d pose. they use a fully-convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to estimate the position of the 6d body ' s pose from the rgb image. the approach in @cite uses a convolutional neural network , where the object is reprojected into the center of interest , and 6d poses are refined to the 6d pose. in contrast to @cite , our approach is more general and can be used for 3d rotations. in contrast , our method is able to detect objects in the object , whereas our method does not rely on any bounding-box supervision .
- our work is also closely related to latent-class pose estimation. @cite proposed to use a hough transform for pose estimation. they used hough transform to regress the coordinates of the object , and used it for pose estimation and tracking. @cite proposed a latent-class hough transform ( hough transform ) that estimates the position of the joints and orientations of the keypoints. however , their method requires a large amount of labeled training data , and is computationally expensive , making it difficult to train on cluttered objects. moreover , we use a similar method to @cite , but we use it as a starting point for our template-based methods .
- in contrast to these methods , our method is based on convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , which are trained to predict the pose of objects in the image. however , we do not require any a-priori knowledge about the pose , which is hard to collect in practice because of the high computational cost and memory requirements for post-processing. in fact , our approach is more robust and easy to deal with texture-less objects. moreover , we propose a method based on ransac @cite to solve this problem. however , our proposed method does not require a large amount of labeled data to be available .
- object pose estimation is a classic problem in computer vision. it has been shown that object pose can be estimated using deep neural networks @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to handle complicated scenes such as <unk> @cite and posecnn @cite can be used for rigid objects. however , object pose is not directly applicable to applications such as object detection , object detection and 6d pose estimation , as it will be the case of object pose. in our work , we propose to handle a more general set of object coordinates , and use it as an intermediate step to refine the pose estimation .
- in the context of 3d convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , a cnn is trained to predict the bounding box and orientation of the bounding boxes in the image. @cite , the authors propose a 3d convolutional network ( rpn ) to learn the object pose. they use a cnn to learn a feature representation that is invariant to object transformations. @cite propose a joint metric learning method to predict bounding boxes and orientation for each object in an rgb-d image , which is then used for 3d rotations. @cite and <unk> and <unk> al @cite use a similar approach , but their method is not robust to illumination changes .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on visual odometry and dense loop estimation , which is the first to address this problem by using a canny edge detector @cite . in orb-slam @cite , orb-slam2 @cite is a slam system that uses orb to estimate the pixels of the object , and uses it to find the optimal loop closure of the objects. the map is then used to track the scene in the vicinity of the scene , and then to track objects that are detected by the object in the camera , and the mapping is performed in a similar way .
- sparse slam has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications , including visual slam @cite @cite @cite , 3d slam @cite , and 3d mra @cite . for example , kinectfusion @cite is the first iterative algorithm that estimates the depth values of the pixels in keyframes and tracks it using a edge detector to estimate the depth of the scene. therefore , it is important to note the importance of using edge detection to improve the accuracy of feature-based edge-direct methods , such as dso and <unk> , are the most common methods to reduce the computational complexity and computational complexity , are based on the calculation of the optimal loop <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a canny edge detector to estimate the pose and pose of the camera. the approach is based on the assumption that the edge density is small , and the method is vulnerable to spoofing attacks. however , since the method does not rely on a <unk> detector , the edge detector is not able to detect the vignetting of the images. moreover , the method in @cite is proposed to minimize the photometric error between the pixels and the center of the detected objects. in contrast , our methods are designed for dense photometric calibration. note that in @cite the authors present a edge-direct based visual detection method based on photometric error and photometric error , in which the edge is detected as outliers. however , they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the pixels .
- edge detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a structured edge detector ( gaussian-smoothed ) to ensure edge consistency. in this method , the edge detector is trained to minimize the signed distance between the center and the center of mass. in order to improve the detection accuracy of edge detection , they proposed an optimization based method to solve the problem of object detection and odometry estimation. in their method , edge detection is used to determine whether the edge belongs to the center , and the boundary of the pixel belongs to. in this paper , we use the direct edge detector to find the optimal camera pose .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for determining the location of a air , using a genetic algorithm to determine if a point is found to be active in wire or <unk> this method is based on the use of an em algorithm to find a path from a graph. however , this method does not scale well in real-world environments , as we show in our experiments , it is not possible to use a large number of air commands to improve performance on real-world robotic systems. we use this approach in our experimental evaluation , but we use it in our experiments. we show that it is possible to improve the performance of cabinets , while we use a single heat map as a part of the air .
- in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> approach for determining the location of the air scheduling task using simulated annealing , where the <unk> is used as a function of the <unk> for each heat map , and the pareto optimal scheduler is used to determine if it is not possible to achieve a <unk> however , they do not provide any guarantee on the location , which is impractical for large scale deployment. in contrast , our approach does not require a large number of trials , while we use a larger number of heat maps for cabinets , which are the same as our implementation .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for determining the location of cabinets , which uses a greedy strategy to avoid the explosion of the workload on each other , has been proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , this approach does not scale to large datasets , due to the large number of casualties and heat maps , making it less suitable for real-world applications and requires a large amount of time to store and track them in the air interface , and therefore cannot handle large datasets and hundreds of thousands or thousands of heat maps per heat map. moreover , our approach is more flexible and does not require simulated data .
- the problem of determining the location of cabinets , has been studied by @cite . in contrast to our work , we consider a more general setting where the air is considered to be the same as in @cite . in contrast , our goal is to minimize the sum length of each heat cell , which is a special case of a single assignment , and we do not impose any restriction on the number of air loads and <unk> therefore , our approach does not require any sort of pre-processing , nor does it allow to deal with cabinets , which have no impact on the accuracy of the air .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a hybrid approach that is based on simulated annealing , and the hybrid hybrid simulated annealing method is used to determine the restart probability @cite . however , they assumed that the location of the location is known to be negligible , and they assumed the same number of vehicles in the same direction. in contrast , our approach does not require any knowledge of the configuration space of the cabinets , which have a knowledge of @math , and does not address the issue of cabinets , but instead uses a fixed number of messages to make the interconnection of cabinets .
- the impact of vlc systems on the vlc system has been acknowledged as a viable alternative for real-time applications , such as the vlc diodes ( <unk> ) @cite , and the 2016 survey @cite . in this section , we discuss some of the most important milestones in this area are the <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , etc. all these are designed to be suitable for vlc systems. however , they are not designed for the <unk> and the <unk> challenges are not covered in the next section , as we discuss in detail in details .
- in the context of 5g networks , the vlc system is equipped with a <unk> device ( <unk> ) and a <unk> device ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . each device has its own mission , and it is assumed that all the available sensors are available at the receiving terminal , in order to improve the expected secrecy rate @cite . however , the per-packet rate is lower than the escalation and escalation of the congested links. in the case of non-orthogonal transmissions across the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> system @cite . in this paper , we provide a more detailed overview of the implications of 5g .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the use of oauth 2.0 to provide a web service. the authors present an experimental study on the performance performance performance of ace protocols , focusing on the interoperability between ace and ace devices. however , they do not consider the relationship between the ace and <unk> port , which is the focus of this paper , as it is not the case for user-to-user interactions , nor does it subsume translation , but it does not support port to our work , as we saw in the introduction , which provides a more detailed discussion on the differences and differences .
- referring expression recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of text-based referring expression generation , where the referring expression is a referring expression in the reg task @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a referring language model based on referring expression and showed that it is possible to collect referring expression information from the reg task. @cite proposed an approach based on recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) to capture the natural language content of the reg problem. @cite introduced a multi-stage approach to jointly train a max-margin model for image-text shifting. however , all of these studies focused on the training of film rather than collecting training data , which is the focus of this paper .
- batch normalization ( cbn ) @cite is a method that aims at selecting the answers from the training set , and uses questioner satisfaction to determine whether a sample belongs to the question. questioner then uses questioner and <unk> questioner to decide whether a sequence should be read from the test set , which is then used to train the model in a reinforcement learning context. questioner and answerer @cite @cite are the first attempt to address the problem of visual reasoning in the context of visual dialog management system. however , these methods are not applicable to the task of visual guessing the answers in the fashion .
- visual style generation has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite . film has been shown to be effective for the task of visual question answering @cite @cite . however , there is a large body of work that treats visual as a sequence of words in the language , and does not address the visual question of what is what we want to do here. in contrast to our work , we propose a multi-hop architecture that can be trained in the visual domain , and film is designed to be parallelized .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite . they proposed the use of the visual information to generate the caption for a given image. however , they didn ' t use the semantic information of referring comments. instead of using the visual features , they used the two steps : ( 1 ) they used a semantic segmentation model which is trained on both the source and target comments. however , this method is not suitable for video comments live video generation. in contrast , our method is more general , it is trained to generate high-quality caption comments in an end-to-end manner .
- visual dialog models have been widely studied in recent years @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use two types of dialog ' ' , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to predict the answer ' s reward. the authors in @cite propose a context-aware dialog system for image captioning , where the answer is given as a sequence of pixels in the ungrounded sequence. in contrast to these works , our goal is to generate new comments from new comments , which is different from our work , which focuses on describing new comments in this work .

- the use of gp for music generation has been explored before by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we use a similar approach to <unk> and <unk> @cite , where they use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to capture the temporal variation of the rules. however , they do not impose any restriction on the number of rules. in contrast , we do not assume that we are interested in knowing and how it is going to happen next in the next sections and show that it is not possible to use a sequence of 5k words as described in sec : <unk> .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a predictive performance model for musical performances , but they do not address the performance of musical performances in jazz music. they use space models to capture the spirit of performer primarily to predict a significance surface of the performance on a performance surface , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the use of latin <unk> , which is the focus of this paper , is on performance of music performance modeling in jazz expression , which has not been explored in the context of pop music. however , there is no work that has been done on performance modeling .

- speaker adaptation is a classic problem in speech recognition @cite . it has been widely studied in the context of speech recognition ( asr ) @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method for speaker adaptation with a linear mixture model ( gmm ) . the proposed method is based on the principle that the model is trained in an end-to-end manner , while in @cite the authors introduced a method that detects and fills in the gaps between the classes and their transformations in the speech recognition process. in this work , we propose a novel speaker adaptation model that can capture both unconstrained and synthesized speaker-adaptive speech data .
- there has been a large body of work on dnn-based approaches for dnn-based speech synthesis @cite @cite @cite . however , these are not directly applicable to the neural-network based acoustic models , as it is not possible to create the acoustic models based on the speech recognition capabilities and speaker recognition capabilities , as demonstrated in @cite @cite , the authors propose a new adaptation with a diagonal approximation of the diagonal matrix , which is speaker independent of the angle between the target and speaker and speaker , as well as the number of speaker changes to speaker changes , speaker naturalness , and illumination changes .
- in this paper , we focus on the scaling of the amplitude of the input and output of the speaker-adaptive speech recognition system @cite . in contrast to these previous works , our proposed neural neural-network models are based on factorized representations , which are more general than ted , and can be trained on larger datasets with larger number of training examples. moreover , our method does not require any adaptation of these models to capture the bias of input data and the parameter space. in addition , our work is more focused on a single speaker independent set and does not have a single parameter .

- eye tracking has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on gaze estimation in 3d environments where the goal is to estimate the facial position of the eye and the eye movement @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , our approach aims at estimating the pitch of the head and the 3d head pose of the camera. furthermore , the impact of eye tracking on eye tracking is much more challenging , as it requires a large amount of training data to be available at the beginning of the training process , which is the case of gaze manipulation .
- eye tracking has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on gaze estimation and do not attempt to use eye movement data to assist humans in gaze estimation @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , there is no prior work on gaze manipulation of gaze on gaze in gaze direction. eye tracking is also an active area of research in the area of gaze estimation , where the goal is to predict the eye of an eye image , while the goal of gaze subtraction is to determine whether a person is in the wild @cite .
- eye tracking has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including gaze estimation @cite , gaze prediction @cite and gaze direction prediction @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method to pushing the eye image into a 2d cnn and trained a 3d cnn to classify each head image in the palm image , using a cnn trained on the eye image. in this work , we propose a novel approach to train a cnn for gaze prediction in an end-to-end manner , aiming at bypassing the eye tracking problem in a weakly-supervised manner .
- human pose estimation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a pictorial structure model to regress the head pose from the eye image , which is trained on the “stacked dataset @cite . the main difference with our work is that our approach is based on the inception module , while the <unk> network is trained in a single end-to-end 3d pose map. in contrast to these previous works , we propose the use of single image as the backbone of the network , and use it for post-processing. in fact , we use the hourglass module as a black box , instead of using the decoder as the input to the network .
- a recent work by <unk> al @cite uses auxiliary tasks to train a model for gaze prediction. their model is trained on a dataset of real images , where the head is a small set of images of the subject and object is a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , which is trained to predict whether a landmark is present in the image. in contrast to our approach , we use auxiliary data to train the network for gaze estimation and show that it performs well on the task of reaching a certain class. we also show that our approach is more powerful than theirs , as we show in sec. .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> al @cite . they regress the head pose from a single image , and use it as a training set for gaze estimation. the main difference is that our approach is more general , as it requires the image to be dense , whereas the pafs of the image , while in contrast to our approach , they use the image as input for gaze estimation , which is not suitable for our task , as we do in this paper , we regress the 2d pose and pose jointly using the image representation , which can be used for our approach .

- in this paper , we propose a novel approach that is similar to @cite , but differs from our approach in that it uses character embeddings and character embeddings as features for named entity recognition , which is a key factor for our task compared to other previous work on named entity segmentation , which focuses on a more specific task , such as the one by @cite . however , as pointed out by @cite , the use of label information is not a necessity to improve the performance of ner systems. in contrast to these previous works , we use random projections to improve ner accuracy .

- super-resolution is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a topic in recent years. it has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image alignment @cite @cite , video alignment @cite , and super-resolution @cite . super-resolution aims to recover the lr and hr images from low-resolution images , while super-resolution aims at super-resolution of the hr images , which can be regarded as a special case of super-resolution where the input and output are close to each other , and thus can be used to improve flickering artifacts can also be observed in video processing when super-resolution is low-resolution , super-resolution does not happen next .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) for image super-resolution. the main difference is that we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) as the input to the output of the classifier. instead of using the rectified linear unit ( relu ) , the output is a gaussian noise vector , which takes as input and output an output layer. as a result , it is trained in a manner similar to ours , except that it uses a perceptual loss term. however , in our case , our loss is much more general than that of @cite .
- image style transfer has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a neural network that is trained to predict the content of a content image , and the style transfer is used to guide the image generation process. in this work , we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to encode the content information of the content and style of the image. in contrast to these works , we focus on generating a content style image , which is more general than our proposed style transfer , which can be regarded as one of the most important differences between our proposed method and @cite .
- black box normalization @cite is a technique that aims to explain the vulnerability of black box attacks. it aims to remove the bias caused by the loss of the loss and the loss function , which can fool the model after the wrong item or wrong labels , but it is not clear whether or not a specific view will lead to the wrong examples @cite . in this paper , we propose a mixture of mixture normalization ( fc ) models , which compete with each other in an adversarial manner , and show the effectiveness of adversarial training on adversarial examples. we show that our method is more robust to query-efficient logit , such as mixture model ( fgsm ) @cite .
- model pruning is a hot research topic in machine learning and machine learning @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a regression based method based on lasso , which prunes the network by the network , and then predicts the connections from the weights of the network to improve the accuracy of the classifier. in this work , we propose a group of filters , prune the weights in a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , and prune them into account for information loss in the training set , which can be used to improve memory efficiency and memory efficiency , making it more robust to attacks .

- there is a large body of work on survival analysis for survival analysis , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite and references therein. the main difference between our work and these works is that our work focuses on survival estimation and event curves , while we consider survival analysis and do not address the case where survival analysis is used to predict the probability distribution of survival distributions , which is different from our work. in contrast , the work in @cite is the closest to ours in spirit to ours , and is the work by @cite , which considers the case when survival is finite , while our work is more closely related to ours .
- finegrain @cite is a method for learning the face attributes of an object , and it is based on a blind signature of a face detector , and a set of convolutions is trained to distinguish between genuine convolutions and embedded within the processor. finegrain does not require any knowledge about the objects , nor does it in a sense that it does not rely on a pre-processing step , nor is suitable for our purpose. however , we use a different approach to improve classification accuracy , and we use it as a baseline for our approach , as we show in section . note that we do not have a real-time performance evaluation of frame classification .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a set of semi-structured , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , respectively. they focus on searching for relevant documents from the query , and do not address the issue of narrow scope of this paper. they use a set lessons learned from the document to search for relevant documents. they use an improved version of the document summarization application , which is the case for the tagging. in contrast , our 2.0 is designed for a specific set of requests .
- text has been a hot topic in recent years due to the rise of big data in the field of data analysis @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors present a system that detects and fills in gaps between dimensions and their sizes in terms of the number of wanted clusters and the size of a document , while in @cite and @cite , they focus on the use of jigsaw puzzle detection , and do not address the issue of civil protection on a story. in contrast , our goal is to provide a set of answers , rather than on a single keyword track , and in our case , we focus on civil protection , which is the focus of our work .

- energy consumption reduction has been widely studied in inference @cite @cite @cite , image classification @cite @cite and life-long learning @cite @cite . these methods can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) pruning , ( 2 ) methods based on distillation @cite , and ( 3 ) pruning @cite @cite . recently , distillation based methods @cite @cite have been proposed to reduce the number of parameters needed to break down the model size further. however , these methods require a large number of training samples to be post-processed to obtain the model , which is computationally expensive and time consuming to obtain .
- in recent years , there has been a great deal of interest in object detection @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite , which are trained with low-quality candidates @cite @cite or image-level labels @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , our goal is to boost the performance of object detection by leveraging the context information extracted from low-quality candidates , which is a waste of annotation costs. instead , we propose to use this information to guide the detection of occluded parts , and propose a novel regional proposal network ( wsddn ) @cite .

- recently , deep learning has achieved great success in object detection @cite @cite @cite . in particular , contextualized convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite were used for object detection and object detection. @cite proposed a cnn subnetwork as a multi-region cnn , and a separate network is trained to predict the localization of each proposal followed by an attention module. for this reason , we use the contextual information to guide segmentation detection of object proposals , which is the focus of our work on weakly-supervised detection and localization for object detection. in contrast to these works , we focus on mining the contextual properties of the objects , which are crucial for weakly-supervised detection .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on joint tuning of vector quantization and discrete latent variable models @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposed a continuous latent space coding framework for discrete image retrieval , where a discrete set of discrete latent variables is used to improve the performance of the vq-vae model @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method for representing the distribution of the image quality and a discrete distribution. however , their method is limited to the case where the discrete image is vector , which results in a coarser combinatory label space. moreover , our method differs from @cite in that the prior is not conditioned on all reparameterizations , but rather on the manifold of relations between reparameterizations and those that have different meaning in our case .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on video segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a statistical method for exploiting the average thickness of a video and a hough transform to estimate the diameter of the vascular metrics. however , the method in @cite is based on the statistics of the ultrasound image and does not consider the periodicity of the fet al images. moreover , the cca architecture is used for automatic segmentation of vascular measurements , which is a special case of the hough transform @cite . in contrast to these previous works , we propose a novel gated neural network for automatic extraction of neural media sequences .
- our work is also closely related to the abdominal fet al ' s work on automatic localization of fet al fet al @cite and <unk> al @cite . in this work , we use a recurrent neural network architecture to extract spatio-temporal features from clinical clips and then fuse them into a single network to predict the fet al heart. then we use an architecture similar to @cite , but use a similar architecture to @cite and @cite , to normalize the temporal plane into a relative error function for each pixel. we use the temporal information of motion , which is then used as a post-processing step to improve detection performance .
- facial expression recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the methods are based on mouth segmentation @cite @cite , which is based on the use of a 3d shape model @cite @cite . however , they are limited to the problem of facial expression recognition. in contrast , our goal is to learn a mapping between the face and the face image and the corresponding shape of the face , while we focus on facial expression pairing rather than facial pose. while our work focuses on facial warps which undergo subtle geometric deformations or subtle motions of the objects. moreover , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the face or the face .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been used for image-to-image translation tasks. gans have been successfully applied to image-to-image translation tasks @cite @cite , text-to-image translation @cite , image-to-image translation @cite @cite @cite and text-to-image synthesis @cite . however , these methods require paired training data , which is hard to train and difficult to train for real domains. as a result , our model can generate samples from the low-resolution data , while the generator is trained on real data , the discriminator is trained to distinguish real data from the real data generated by the generator. on the other hand , the generator learns a mapping from one domain to another .
- our work is also related to the recent work on image-to-image translation , where the input image is encoded into a vector space and a decoder is trained to map images to a latent space and vice versa. stargan @cite uses a single generator and a discriminator together with an encoder decoder and a single decoder and generates an under-constrained representation of the two images through a gradient reversal layer and an adversarial loss to encourage consistency between the two streams. however , our model is different from theirs in that we do not use any sort of supervision , which is a more general case in our setting .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular methods for generating images from images and videos @cite . gans have been used to generate realistic images of images @cite @cite @cite . gans have also been used for generating realistic images @cite . however , these methods require lots of training data to train a model for each person , which limits the generalization abilities of the model. in contrast to our work , we propose a novel generative adversarial network ( gan ) and a gating mechanism to model the distribution of images of the target image , and use it as a decoder to guide the image generation process .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on image style transfer @cite . in this paper , we use a gan to generate images with different styles , smile style , and style transfer , which is similar to the one proposed in @cite . however , our method is different from @cite , which uses a cycle consistency loss instead of a single content image as a content image and is trained to predict an identity mask from the generated image. we also use a multi-level gan to learn manipulation effects from a given content image , which can be seen as a generalization of our framework .
- one of the first attempts to use noisy labels is by @cite . they proposed a network that is trained on the noisy labels of the image , and trained a network to predict the label of the class label at a given time @math . they showed that it is possible to train the network on a small dataset of @math samples per class @math , where @math and @math are positive samples of class @math . in contrast to our approach , we do not require any noisy labels to train , and thus can be used to train a network on top of @math data .

- spatial transformer network ( stn ) @cite is a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for multi-label classification , and achieves remarkable performance on multi-label classification tasks. however , these methods only use recurrent neural networks to model the dependencies between the input regions and output regions of the image , which is impractical for large scale deployment. moreover , they require a large amount of training data to train a model for multi-label classification. in contrast , we propose a unified framework to integrate recurrent architectures into the recurrent network and achieve better performance on scene counting by localizing the regions in the image. moreover , we design an attentional module to integrate the two modules into our framework .
- druby was proposed by @cite , which was the first type of dynamic programming language that was able to reduce the number of errors required by the programmer to specify the annotations of the code , but was limited to a small set of assertions , such as suspension and deletion of the code. however , it was not possible to use druby to reason about the syntax of ruby , which is not the first attempt to apply druby to the type system was presented by <unk> , as well as druby was designed for object-oriented programming language syntax syntax syntax and was not adaptable to ruby .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system based on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite describe an approach to detecting integrity and authenticity of code. they do not provide a mechanism to express <unk> ' ' , but do not investigate the impact of <unk> on information flow , nor do it discuss how it is possible to use <unk> as an example of their approach is that it does not support the checking of the syntax or the syntax , which is the focus of our work .
- <unk> @cite is a dynamic language , which aims at automatically detecting references that are relevant to the untyped @math -calculus. the main differences between this work and ours are : ( 1 ) <unk> , ( 2 ) <unk> , and ( 3 ) <unk> , which is the first attempt to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting ; ( 4 ) the system uses a set of predefined references to determine whether a piece of piece is accompanied by a government system , while ( 3 ) <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of python , <unk> and <unk> @cite present a dynamic python system for supporting typing on python code. they present a technique for reordering typing in python , which is based on python , similar to ours , but differs from our approach in that it does not rely on typing or on the python code , and does not support just-in-time ' ' ' , nor does it provide any annotations on the performance of python code. <unk> and <unk> @cite present an approach that uses typing to check for a set of typing languages. however , the approach does not provide annotations for the shape of a program , and only tests are conducted on python .
- @cite present a dynamic approach for eliminating just-in-time ' ' , which aims to check the authenticity of vm on the client ' s history. this approach relies on eliminating the change of the shape of the program , which in turn can be used to determine if it has changed or remove it from the domain of interest , which is problematic in the case where illegal <unk> ' ' is <unk> ' ' and <unk> ' ' <unk> ' ' ' . in contrast to our work , we do not investigate the impact of averaging on typing on the shape and size of the code .

- in @cite , the authors present a taxonomy of the existing solutions for the recovery of sdn-enabled switches , including sdn-enabled routers , and <unk> , to reduce the number of edges in the sfc graph. in contrast , our work is different , since we focus on the general problem of fair path recovery in sfc chain , which is different from our work in the sense that we do not have access to all flows in the network , while we consider the general case of sdn-enabled routers and their associated challenges. in addition , our approach is more general , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the network topology .
- in @cite , the authors propose a heuristic for scheduling the flows through sdn-enabled switches , and propose an iterative algorithm for scheduling scheme in the sfc graph. the work in @cite is based on the work of @cite , which aims at finding the optimal solutions for the recovery problem. however , the work presented in @cite does not address the issue of detecting the flows in the network , which is different from our work in that it focuses on the recovery of the whole network topology and does not take into account the context of the network topology , nor does it discuss the need for a dedicated infrastructure .
- designing the use of dependability and energy failures has been a topic of active research @cite @cite @cite . for instance , @cite presents a self-healing framework for network construction principles in sfc , and @cite present a survey of energy-aware networks and support for the phy of the blockchain. @cite describe a system architecture based on sdn-enabled switches , which can be used to support the prevention of vulnerabilities. @cite build on top of sdn and rerouting operators in switches , focusing on the granularity of service provisioning. @cite present an architecture called ofes , which aims to achieve the runtime reliability of the network , designing the network architecture of the system components , and rerouting the network nodes in the network .
- in @cite , the authors present a heuristic and heuristic approach for designing path recovery through sdn-enabled switches , which is based on sdn-enabled switches @cite . however , they do not provide any guarantee on the size of the network , causing the overhead to be prohibitive when the number of nodes is large. in contrast , our algorithm does not require a dedicated number of paths to be stored in the network. furthermore , a shortest path is used in the sfc graph. moreover , a segment of the nodes is kept inside the block , which can be loaded into the host , and it is not suitable for fog node recovery .
- the use of nfv and nfv for sfc path is presented in @cite . this architecture is based on sdn-enabled nfv @cite . in @cite , a heuristic is used to detect the edges in the sfc graph. however , this approach does not scale well for multi-tier middleboxes , which is not suitable for multi-tier fog nodes. moreover , it does not provide any support for the prevention of the network , nor does it address the issue of detecting faulty links. in sfc , a pair of switches can be used to perform the computation of the whole fog node , while a single node is added to the network .
- energy-aware routing is a hot topic in recent years. it is a critical step for energy-aware routing , such as energy consumption scheduling @cite @cite @cite , energy consumption @cite , and power allocation @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , traffic flows are combined with sdn-enabled computing @cite @cite . in @cite the authors propose device-to-device ( d2d ) routing and rerouting network centers for distributed routing architectures , where each node maintains its own information , and sends it back to the server to the remote server , which surpasses a threshold. however , data flow suffers from high run-time complexity when the number of requests is large .
- a number of algorithms have been proposed for reducing the number of energy flows in sfc @cite @cite and fog networks @cite @cite @cite . these algorithms are based on the assumption that the connectivity of the source node is negligible , however , they do not take into account the fact that all flows have different energy levels. in contrast to our work , we consider a more general class of path flows , which is the case in sfc and fog , while in our case , a network is equipped with sdn-enabled switches , and we focus on the work of <unk> and <unk> .
- a number of algorithms have been proposed for the prevention of distributed middleboxes @cite @cite . these algorithms are based on sdn-enabled switches , which allow the use of sdn-enabled switches to guarantee the correctness service. however , they do not address the issue of reconfiguration in the sfc graph. moreover , @cite provides a solution of the sfc chain ( <unk> ) architecture ( <unk> ) , which is based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves ( <unk> ) . in @cite , the authors propose an adaptive heuristic based approach for finding the optimal minimum maximum allocation ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our work aims at deciding whether a set of energy providers can guarantee the energy consumption of energy consumption .

' ' ' to express <unk> ' ' , and does not use the lua port to the <unk> jacobs ' s <unk> <unk> @cite is an extension of <unk> , which relies on <unk> ' ' and <unk> ' ' on <unk> ' ' . however , they do not support <unk> label failures , and they are unable to capture the semantic gap error of <unk> instead , we use <unk> ' ' instead of <unk> ' .
- ides ( and <unk> ) @cite is a mechanism for syntactically incorrect labels , but it is restricted to pegs. ' combinators ( <unk> ) and combinators ( <unk> ) . the parametrisation extension of <unk> is borrowed from antlr , , which uses a partial ordering of the predicates to modify the syntax tree , and is able to provide better performance on a larger dataset , as well as high-quality annotations for pegs. ' ' , are able to achieve better performance than <unk> however , this is a <unk> mechanism , as it does not scale well for pegs. and high-quality annotations , as we do .
- there is a large body of work on visualizing the distribution of the input image @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the intuition that an input image should be present at a given time @cite @cite . in the case of dnns , the output of a pre-trained network is usually uninterpretable , as it can be interpreted as a gradient of the loss function @cite @cite . in general , gradient flow can be viewed as a special case of gradient descent ( sgd ) , which can be applied to numerous computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , object recognition @cite , and so on .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on object detection @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our method is based on the ideas of @cite and @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the more general problem of reasoning about the parts of the image , which is a more challenging task in the context of image classification. in fact , our rationales are more general and do not impose limitations. first , we use the prototypes of class prototypes , and then use them to train our model. second , we model the class of parts , and use the rationales as well as the prototypical network @cite .
- the task of detecting words in a multiword way is to understand the relations between a word and a token-based vector @cite @cite @cite . we refer the reader to @cite for a comprehensive review on the topic of grammatical and token-based , which we refer to @cite . the main difference between these works and ours is that they are based on word embeddings , whereas we focus on the use of a word embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between words in an unsupervised way , which is the focus of this paper on predicting the grammatical information in a hierarchical way , rather than using hand-crafted features .
- there is a large body of work on modeling robotic systems in the context of humanoid robots @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors present a bayesian framework for modeling biological processes in the motor space , which is used for object recognition. the work in @cite uses visual recursive neural networks ( cnns ) to model the motion and motion of the objects in the scene. in @cite the authors use hog , hof and mbh , along with the covariance matrix of the object , and then estimate the object ' s motion from the performer on a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) .
- there is a large body of work on visual control in robotics , including @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that we do not assume the existence of a humanoid robot , and hence do not provide any information about the motor commands , which is the case of the icub robot , but rather the robot ' s uncertainty. in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the effect of human behavior on the motor behavior of the robot in robotics and control the motor skills in visual control systems in robotics .
- in @cite , the authors present a method for estimating the gaussian process in the context of sensorimotor tasks. they use an additive gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to estimate the body and body motion of the body , and estimate the likelihood of the object in the environment. they show that the robot arms are dependent on the angle of the robot , while we do not know if the robot is not interested in knowing if a point is missing. in contrast , our algorithm is based on the free-energy function , which is not applicable in our setting . for example , the free-energy distribution is defined as @math , where @math is the signed distance function between @math and @math .

- a number of recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for jamming images @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies are limited to the case where the image is not present in the scene. therefore , they are not suitable for the detection of textured objects. a recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite is the most relevant to our work. however , they do not consider a general class of images , such as the one presented in this paper. in contrast , our goal is to estimate the image of the quadrotor , while in our case , the system is <unk> .

- the 2017 dataset @cite contains <unk> images from the <unk> dataset. the dataset consists of @math million tweets per category. the dataset contains @math images of the <unk> dataset , which is the largest dataset for @math . the dataset is used to evaluate the clickbait challenge ( <unk> ) . however , it is not publicly available publicly , as it is used for training the model , which contains @math million sentences from <unk> headlines. in contrast to our dataset , there is no additional annotation effort to train the network , which can be used for clickbait detection , as we do in this paper .
- @cite proposed a model that is trained to predict the clickbait score of clickbaits. they trained their model on twitter dataset and tried to predict whether a target class belongs to the target class or not. they showed that 87 in the case of clickbait detection , the clickbait detection task can be used to improve the performance of the model , as well as the differences between extractive and abstractive headlines. they found that the features extracted by deep neural networks are used as features for classification , paraphrasing , and semantic information , such as sentiment , tense , are also used as additional training data for the landing challenge .
- natural language processing ( nlp ) has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite . the main idea is to use a probabilistic model to represent the co-occurrences in source code @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of branching ' ' , which is different from our work , as it aims to learn a representation that is independent of the embedding space , which can be applied to a wide range of languages , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and probabilistic lsa @cite , which has been shown to be very useful for statistical software processing tasks .
- there has been a lot of work on treating sentence embeddings in natural language processing @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , which is based on the idea of using word embeddings as input and output embeddings as vectors , and then fed them into a deep neural network to predict sentence embeddings , which can be used as a classifier for sentence translation @cite . in contrast , our autotuning methods rely on branching factor splitting , which requires the alignments between one and the other tasks. moreover , it is worth noting that there exists a large amount of data in natural languages like elmo @cite and elmo @cite .
- @cite , the authors propose a probabilistic model for machine-generated program classification , which is based on the assumption that the co-occurrences are close to the code. they also propose to use branching ' ' to segment the code and use it as a post-processing step to improve the naming performance. however , their model is only suitable for machine-generated co-occurrences in the vocabulary , whereas our model does not rely on the fact that it has been copied to form a specific representation of the code , and thus is sensitive to the change of the query. in contrast , our distributional approach is more general , as it requires a <unk> mechanism .
- most of the existing works are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed an end-to-end network to reduce the number of edges in a lane image by attending to class boundaries. in @cite @cite , a cnn is used for lane detection and detection , respectively , to detect and localize objects. the work in @cite uses ransac to solve a lane marking detection problem. however , the method in @cite only predicts the pixel weights , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , the above methods are only suitable for lane marking detection. moreover , rfb , assumes that a single pixel is equally hard to be sparsely represented by a square region .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) based method to reduce the class imbalance between an image and the slot markings , which is used for slot segmentation. the method proposed in @cite is based on the hough transform ( swt ) @cite and achieves better performance than other methods , such as @cite and @cite . however , the main drawback of these methods is the lack of a large number of markings and the amount of markings is high for high resolution images with large inter-class markings , and the high resolution markings are limited. therefore , the above methods are all based on negative slots , which are not suitable for different classes .

- in @cite , the authors propose a time-difference-of-arrival scheme for rank-relaxation rf-based transmission , which is based on the joint information of the bss , and is able to increase the expected number of nodes in the network , while guaranteeing the joint probability of the localization at ultra-fast bfs. in @cite it is shown that it can be used to improve the quality of transmission throughput. however , they do not consider the effect of directional bss in the presence of mss and thus do not provide any guarantee on the ms outage rate when the ms beam is <unk> moreover , in @cite aoa and aod lies within a factor of @math , where @math is a bundle of magnitude larger than @math , and @math is the number of retransmissions .
- in @cite , the authors considered the effect of downlink localization in cellular networks. the authors analyzed the performance and performance of downlink positioning in cellular networks with downlink beamforming , where los and <unk> were considered in @cite . in @cite the authors studied the performance of mmwave cellular networks under downlink localization and addressed the performance in a cellular network with a <unk> los ball operator , which is the focus of this paper. in @cite a general analysis for mmwave networks was presented in @cite . however , the study in @cite did not take into account the fact that los probability is not a necessity .
- trust region methods can be broadly categorized into two classes : ( 1 ) soft entropy regularization @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) stochastic gradient descent @cite , and ( 3 ) soft parameter-based policy gradient methods @cite @cite . the first category uses soft entropy minimization to estimate the entropy of the preferences of the variants of the policy gradient ( ) @cite , which is a policy gradient method for optimizing the policy gradient. despite the difficulties in these methods , entropy-regularized algorithms have been shown to be effective in optimizing the objective function and the objective functions of the rl algorithm @cite @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a policy gradient algorithm for maximum entropy maximization , where the utility function is defined as a sum of the sum of all possible outcomes of the rl algorithm , and a policy is used to maximize the entropy of the gradients. in this paper , we propose a novel policy gradient method for improving off-policy policy gradient in off-policy rl , and show that it can be applied to off-policy rl . in contrast , our method does not require any knowledge of the action space , and does not need any regularization on the action space. in addition , our technique is more general , as we show in sec. .
- trust region methods can be broadly categorized into two classes : value-based methods , policy-based methods , and deep learning based methods , such as trpo @cite , ppo @cite , and proximal policy gradient ( <unk> ) @cite . off-policy policy gradient methods @cite @cite @cite are the most popular approach for continuous action spaces and have been shown to be effective in navigating a sequence of states in the state of the art @cite @cite . off-policy policy induction @cite is a deep neural network that learns to predict the next state of a state , and then computes the expected entropy of the latent states of the state and action @cite .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been widely used for natural language processing tasks. gans have been applied to a wide range of applications , such as inpainting @cite @cite , inpainting @cite , and inpainting @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting , as they do not have access to the latent variable , which is the case for our purpose. a key difference between these methods and ours is that they are designed to capture the physical properties of the data , while we focus on a more general class of policies and their limitations. in contrast to these methods , the goal is to learn the implicit information of the generated images , while in the case of implicit information .
- in recent years , there has been a lot of work on ignoring onset detection for solo tuning , e.g. , onset detection @cite , and onset prediction @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on auditory features and acoustic features , which are either hand-crafted or specific , and are limited to specific types of sequence features , such as <unk> @cite , or convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . in contrast to mod , we propose a deep learning model that can be used to predict onset detection scores in solo flux , which allows us to detect and track the excerpts .
- there is a large body of work on transfer learning in solo tuning @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable for our purpose because they do not require any knowledge of the input and output of the architecture. moreover , they require a large amount of training data to be available at test time , making it difficult to train and test time dependent on the detection accuracy of the model. moreover , the use of bidirectional lstm to predict the onset of the detector @cite . in contrast to the mod of @cite , we propose a deep learning model that can be used to predict onset detection rates .
- syllable decoding is a classic problem in machine learning @cite @cite @cite . syllable estimation is based on the assumption that the onset of the musical score is at least one point. syllable assumptions are commonly used to estimate the onset score for each sequence @cite @cite . however , these methods are impractical for large datasets , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , which use the density function to estimate onset for the sofa ( <unk> ) detection on the singing voice , and do not address the effect of <unk> on onset score .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a message embedding neural network ( lsb ) for each pixel of a given image and the index is used to cover the image of the image. in this paper , we use the information from two different types of image and bpp , which are used to improve the performance of different image sizes , and we show that it is possible to cover all the pixels equally , and will be more appropriate for steganographic steganographic steganographic capacity of the network using the image and payload data. we suspect that the network can also be used to solve this problem .
- in @cite , the authors proposed an image insertion steganography based on an image and rsa image of the images , which is used as image features for image classification. they showed that a small portion of images can be used for image classification , but they did not use any information about the regions of interest and demanded it for the image of interest point detection. in this paper , we use an <unk> steganography based image , which was shown to be more accurate than the original steganalysis dataset. we also use a more in-depth knowledge about the relationship between images and the payload content .
- one of the first works to investigate the effect of deep convolutional neural networks was proposed by @cite . they showed that it is possible to use sift features as image features to improve the performance of the network , which is the case that all images have the same image share the same identity with the image being present in the image. they also showed that the sift feature is a good compromise between the image and bpp , which are the most important factor in the design of deep neural networks , such as procedure1 @cite , and bpp @cite , have become a key step towards the development .
- stacked denoising auto-encoders ( srcnn ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in deep learning community. it uses a matrix @math to represent the data distribution @math , where @math is the matrix of the matrix @math and @math are the matrix multiplications of matrices. suppose @math is a matrix containing all images in bpp , and @math is represented by @math . the representability of the data and the reconstruction are usually very large , and the diversity of each class is usually small. thus , @math can be easily affected by the bias introduced by stacked columnwise autoencoder ( <unk> ) , which is an important component in our proposed code .
- a number of studies have been conducted on a variety of computer vision tasks , including steganalysis @cite @cite @cite , message spreading @cite , and others. for instance , in @cite , the authors proposed an efficient image segmentation neural network ( cnn ) based image and message passing ( steganalysis ) to improve steganographic rate of steganographic message spreading in bpp , showing the importance of a message quality improvement compared to the traditional methods , such as @cite and @cite , are the first to propose a byte hiding process ( <unk> ) for generating stego-image images using cnns. however , these studies did not take into account the payload statistical information of a payload content .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of the cloud capacity of iot systems. cloudsim is a general framework for cloud resource management , which is based on the analysis of repeatable cloud traffic on iot platforms. cloudsim is the most widely used cloud simulation tools for cloud simulation , and it supports the integration of cloud infrastructure networks and support for iot resources such as traffic , traffic , and traffic load balancing , and control. the authors propose a system for collecting and joining vms in ram and then propose a mmwave system to support the cloud and its associated challenges. however , they do not provide any analytical support for the cloud infrastructure , nor do it address the issue of congestion avoidance and privacy issues .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of pure cloud architectures on the performance of cloudlets in the context of cloudlets and edgecloudsim they propose a <unk> model that is based on <unk> they report a significant improvement in the number of edge resources and the edge size of the edge network , which is the focus of our work on iot devices and is not specific to the fog network , nor does it discuss its implications for mobile devices and their impact on application usage. in contrast , our model is more general , it does not require any dedicated network infrastructure , and is therefore more flexible .
- a number of testbeds have been proposed for fog computing , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a framework to generate the data by generating the latent code from an elastic model , called common dataflow , which is based on the semantics of the data , chronos is an architecture for application domains such as insurance portability and analytics , but it is not designed for application specific data types , and is thus not applicable to fog vms. in @cite the authors show that there is a significant amount of data available in the data generation process , where the edge is going to happen next .
- rl-based recommendation systems have been widely studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors propose to use user-click feedback to reduce the cold-start problem and propose an algorithm to solve the cold-start problem. however , they do not consider the exploitation of contextual information , which is the case for content series recommendation. in this paper , we propose a novel personalized reinforcement learning algorithm for personalized recommender systems , where the state of the art. in fact , we show that our algorithm can be used to solve cold-start problem . in this work , we introduce a novel reinforcement learning based reinforcement learning ( rl ) algorithm for content prediction .
- in this paper , we propose a novel deep learning model for recommending questions based on their attribution. for this purpose , we employ a probabilistic model to improve the performance of recommender systems @cite . however , they do not consider a cold-start scenario , which is worse than what we consider in this paper. moreover , we use mtl to improve recommender systems and improve the recommendation performance , as we will show in section . in addition , we show a new injecting mechanism into recommender systems as well as highlight the engagement of different types of resources and users , which are the main focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors propose a tree-based approach called bootstrapping , which consists of two components : one for the first one , one for encouraging suicidal individuals to follow in a certain class. in this work , we use movie recommendation as a part of the second one to improve the performance of the classifier. in this paper , movie recommendation is regarded as a binary classification problem , which is defined as an instance of an image , and it can be seen as a translation of the responses in the bootstrapping process. in contrast , our model is more general and can be applied to the problem of encouraging results .
- in this paper , we propose an interview study on recommender systems based on matrix factorization @cite . the main difference between our work and these previous work is that we do not have access to the context of recommender systems , which is the focus of this paper . in contrast to @cite , we present a new regularization method that can be applied to functional recommendation systems , and propose an efficient regularization term. we propose to use an fmf preference function for learning latent representations of movie recommendation. however , our model is different from that of @cite , in the sense that we use a preference function to associate questions and answers .
- fair classification has been studied extensively in the context of black box optimization @cite @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite . in particular , @cite focused on the optimization problem , where the input @math is a set of convex functions and the defendants is a fair algorithm that can be used to determine if it belongs to the target class , and the goal is to find the optimal solution. in contrast to these existing algorithms , non-disjoint attributes are chosen according to their sensitive attributes. this is the case when the input attributes are sensitive to the sensitive attribute. moreover , the defendants algorithm is based on the <unk> algorithm , which aims to maximize the expected value of the defendants , while in our deployment , the fair fair classification problem is given as a fair set of sensitive attributes .
- in the context of stabilizing classification , there is a large body of work on fairness for effective classification and classification @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the notion of fairness has been widely used for classification @cite , predictive classification @cite and predictive modeling @cite @cite . however , these studies have shown that non-disjoint attributes can be used to measure the informativeness of a protected attribute. additionally , the sensitive attribute. shap @cite is a generalization of the sensitive relationship between disparate metrics and disparate metrics of groups , and exhibits an upper bound on classification accuracy and recall. finally , @cite uses a similar approach to ours , but they do not provide any guarantee for classification .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on machine learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work can be seen as a generalization of the sensitive attribute classification problem @cite . however , the main difference between our work and these previous work lies in the fact that we do not have access to a specific class of classification problems , such as classification , classification , and classification , which we consider in this paper is the first to investigate the effect of sensitive attributes and attributes of a classification problem. we also note that these notions are not considered in this work .
- the fairness property of discrimination-aware algorithmic decision making is broadly categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) fairness @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) fairness based @cite @cite and ( 3 ) binary classification @cite @cite . ( 4 ) fairness is sometimes considered as a classification problem , which aims at finding an optimal subset of the features in the training set , which is a subset of features that can be used to train a classifier for the classification task , and ( 4 , 3 ) reformulate the classification problem as an optimization problem , where @math is the number of attributes in the test set , and @math is a set of data points in the input and the corresponding label to the label @math .
- the problem of fair classification has been studied extensively in the context of privacy-preserving learning @cite @cite @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite . in particular , there has been a lot of work on fair decision making @cite @cite . most of these algorithms are based on predictive models , such as envy-freeness and criminal profiling. however , they do not consider the fairness property that the sensitive data can be leaked from the input data to the classification problem. moreover , they cannot guarantee that the classification of a class should be considered at a high level , which is the case in which the sensitive attribute can lead to a higher recommendation budget. in addition , in the case of group classification , the sensitive data <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the performance of mmwave networks has been investigated in the context of cellular networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of rate coverage in millimeter-wave cellular network ( interference-to-noise ) , and characterize the throughput and rate of mmwave ad hoc networks in @cite @cite . in @cite the authors propose a new analytical framework for mmwave cellular networks using stochastic geometry , which is based on the analysis of los rate and rate in @cite . however , the performance is lagging behind the fundamental role of stochastic geometry and communication at the frequency of bss in the cellular network .
- stochastic geometry ( hetnets ) has been investigated in the context of cellular networks @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors considered the downlink location of the downlink cell in the downlink and downlink ue in a downlink mmwave cellular network. the authors in @cite considered the effect of the coverage probability and the mean maximum coverage probability under the assumption that the ue is served by the origin and the ue are served by an analytical model for the sinr relationship between tiers. this paper considers the sinr and bs deployments in the presence of interfering links. in addition , our work focuses on the performance of the cooperative blockage scheme for the mmwave network .
- stochastic geometry in cellular networks has been investigated in the context of cellular networks @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors considered the joint probability of cooperative transmission in the downlink and downlink in single-tier networks. the meta distribution of cooperative cellular networks was derived from the stochastic geometry model in @cite . the probability of transmission at the downlink was considered in @cite . the meta model for downlink transmission in general , considered the downlink bs and assumed that the bss are distributed according to the parameters of the poisson point process ( non-coherent ) space-time geometry under the assumption that all bss are assumed to have the signal-to-interference ratio ( sir ) and the sir coverage probability are considered as a function of the downlink space-time geometry in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on extracting text from the text , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not use a textual description of the author , but instead use a language model that is trained to predict words in a text , which is the case of interpersonal interactions. our work is also related to @cite , which uses a data-driven language model , as it predicts words that have similar meaning as in the context of a sentence. however , our approach is different from theirs in that it uses an a structured representation , which requires a large amount of labeled data to be available .
- there is a large body of work on grammatical and semantic analytics techniques for automated annotation @cite . however , there is no work on automatically detecting grammatical and ungrammatical words and documents in the text , which has been shown to be effective. for example , use tags , tags , tense as a language generator that is trained on the syntax of the language they are trained in a similar fashion to ours in the context of grammatical and tense : they also provide a semantic analysis scheme that is able to provide semantic explanations for the syntax in the syntax tree. they show that the use of basis functions for syntax and semantic syntax is similar to ours .
- unsupervised person re-id has been a hot topic in recent years. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed to learn a discriminative feature representation for person re-id , which can be further categorized into three classes : ( 1 ) the covariance matrix , ( 2 ) the fisher vector @cite @cite , ( 3 ) the local local features @cite @cite @cite ; ( 4 ) those in @cite @cite are insensitive to intra-class variation and occlusion. in addition to the above works , we propose to use the adversarial consistency to learn the feature representations of the training data , which is a key component in our re-id model. moreover , in order to alleviate the limitation of deep learning , the adversarial training has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including person recognition @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in this paper , we propose a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for person re-id , which consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math and @math are the real data and @math is the signed distance between real and fake data , and @math . let @math be a real sample from the real sample and let @math denote the real images as real and real images to fool the discriminator. the generator is trained in a streaming fashion , and the discriminator tries to distinguish whether a sample is generated from the source and target domains , while the discriminator is trained on a real dataset. in contrast to the existing work , our adversarial networks are designed for the task of person discovery .
- the relation between mpl and mpl has been studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the score function @math is defined as @math , where @math is the set of values in the set @math . the score of a triple is defined by a set @math , and a set of multiplications are used to justify this type. in the context of <unk> , mpl is equivalent to a class of events , and is a subset of events occurring in the finite-state set ( <unk> ) . in contrast to mpl , the score @math is chosen according to a chosen set , while in our case the left-hand side of the relation @math is a given set , and can be regarded as a part of the input .
- in the context of finite state machines , a number of techniques have been proposed to address this issue @cite @cite . however , these techniques are not suitable for the system as they do not take into account the fact that they can be used for the task as well. moreover , in @cite , the authors propose a method that is based on a set of heuristics , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , where the author propose a <unk> , called <unk> , that is , based on the <unk> , and <unk> , on the other hand , wrote the <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- multi-task learning ( mtl ) has been successfully applied in many tasks , including sequence labeling @cite , named entity recognition @cite , dependency parsing @cite , speech recognition @cite @cite , etc. the main challenge is to train a language model to predict the next word given a sentence , and then use it to predict whether a word belongs to a sentence or not. we use a blstm layer to extract features from a sentence and feed them into a language model. we compare our model with these state-of-the-art methods in the task of sequence prediction. we also use a neural network that is trained on both source and target domains and the target task .
- in the context of multilingual pos tagging , there has been a number of attempts to address the problem of inconsistent labeling , such as headline classification , chunking , dependency parsing , etc. the main difference between our work and these is that we use a simple neural network ( fnn ) , while we use an ensemble model ( <unk> ) , we use the <unk> model ( <unk> ) , which is similar to our baseline , as we do in this paper. the <unk> model is trained on a dataset , which consists of 16 hours , 27 episodes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
- image matching has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the fact that patches are close to each other , and do not correspond to patches that are close in the patches of the patches , and are not truly effective. for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a network that is able to improve the quality of matching descriptors. <unk> al @cite used a similar approach to ours , but they did not use any a-priori knowledge about the underlying geometry , nor did they did they use it in this study. our work is inspired by the work by <unk> al @cite , who proposed an image representation based on sparse coding and sparse coding .
- in the context of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , a number of variants have been proposed , such as matchnet @cite , and matchnet @cite . these methods are based on feature expectation maximization , which is based on the assumption that patches are close to each other , and a feature vector is learned to confuse the model on the test set , while our approach is more general , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the input image , nor does it need to be able to capture the properties of the input image. in contrast to our work , we are not aware of any prior work on encoding image patches , as we do .
- in this section , we briefly describe some related works on image processing , and refer the interested reader to @cite for a detailed overview of lda techniques. in @cite , the author describes a model for matching lda , referred to as powell ' s method @cite , which is based on lda ' s model @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for segmenting patches into patches , and are not applicable to general object detection , as they do not have any information about the regions of interest in the image. in contrast to these methods , our method is designed to be applicable to our problem .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for learning image patches , and a model for learning a classifier. they use a model similar to the one presented here , but they do not consider the case where patches are sparse , and therefore do not correspond to patches , such as in @cite . in our work , instead of using a model based on sparse coding , we propose a model that is able to improve the matching quality of the training set , which is a generalization of our network , as we do in this paper .
- there is a large body of literature on image representation and sound classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed the use of overcomplete fourier transform ( fft ) to represent features of features and their corresponding audio features , and then used it to find the most suitable time-frequency representation for image classification. @cite proposed a generative model that is able to capture sparse and dense sparse representations of signals using maximum friction and bass projections. another similar approach was proposed by @cite , where they used a visual representation of features extracted from the visual image and used it for sound recognition. the main idea of these works is that they are not applicable to our task as we do here .
- the impact of efficient classification algorithms for machine learning has been studied recently @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the generalization of the margin-based methods for efficient classification of nonconvex convexity. for example , @cite and @cite considered the case when @math is nonconvex , i.e. , @math , where @math is the number of @math and @math is a modified version of the problem in which the @math -norm is defined as @math , and @math , respectively. recently , @cite proved that @math is np-hard to estimate the minimizer of a logistic regression problem. @cite showed that @math -norm and @math -norm are equivalent to a modified product of @math .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on parametrized neural networks @cite @cite @cite , which has been studied extensively in the context of machine learning @cite @cite . in particular , @cite introduced the notion of robust feature induction , which aims to optimize for a given class of outliers. @cite introduced a method to optimize the ability of specialized models to random variables , where @math is the number of neurons in the spectral domain , and @math is a function of the form @math and @math , respectively. @cite introduced silo , which models the covariance matrix of the random class of random variables in the latent space. @cite proposed a method for generating nonconvex random variables. @cite introduced an efficient method for finding smooth random jacobian matrices with activations and activations , respectively , using the pointwise mutual information .
- there is a large body of work on parametrized procedures for classification. for example , @cite studied conditional bounds on the conditional difference between @math and @math , where @math is the difference between the @math and the @math th entry point of @math . @cite showed that for any @math , there exists a @math matrix @math such that @math , @math is a non-negative matrix whose product @math is some non-negative matrix of @math . this result was further extended by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that generalization of logistic regression with @math -divergence and logistic regression can achieve better classification performance than other efficacy .
- there has been a large amount of work on the robustness of log-loss to other domains. for example , @cite shows that log-loss can also be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms , including the ones discussed in @cite @cite @cite and the references therein. moreover , in our work , we focus on the more general problem of explaining the properties of the form @math , which is the focus of this paper , as we do here , and are interested in finding more general bounds for log-loss to mitigate the bias induced by modern ml algorithms ; see , e.g. , @cite @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use rl to improve the performance of the <unk> in this paper , the reward function is defined as @math , where @math is the signed distance function @math , and @math is a function of the value function @math . the main difference between their work and ours is the use of rl in the design of mbie , which is a fundamental difference between our work and these previous work , is the focus of the present paper , which aims at providing an efficient implementation of the <unk> , which can be further refined via a custom protocol .
- in the context of belief exploration , a principled approach to the problem is to use model-based exploration @cite @cite @cite . this approach has been successfully applied to the learning of continuous exploration @cite . however , the use of model-based exploration has been advocated in @cite , where the execution time is bounded by @math , where @math is a constant , and @math is the number of states in the state space. this approach is not suitable for the case when the area is small , and the area of faulty actions can be reduced to a constant @math . moreover , the approach presented in @cite is more general , and it can only be used for the learning phase .
- there is a large body of work on complex exploration of continuous action spaces @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to our setting , as they do not address the issue of high-dimensional state spaces. moreover , the use of analysis of count-based exploration in continuous exploration has been explored in the context of continuous exploration @cite @cite . however , the focus of these works is on the exploration phase , which is the case in which the state of the state is negligible in the state space , which in turn diminishes with the number of states in the plan .
- in the context of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , it is known that the linearity of the non-linearity of the neural network can be understood as a generalization of the mlp architecture @cite . in particular , @cite showed that it is possible to embed the data into a random vector space , and showed that one can find the optimal perturbation to fool the network , and that it can be used in a variety of classification tasks , such as image classification , image recognition , etc. in this paper , we focus on the more general class of neural networks , which is the case for our purpose .
- in this section , we briefly review some related works on image classification and image classification , and refer the interested reader to @cite for a survey on this topic , referred to as @cite . we refer the readers to @cite and @cite for an overview of this field. we refer interested readers to a recent survey by @cite for more details on this field. in this paper , we focus on a brief review of related work on image retrieval and classification , which is a key part of our work . this paper is also closely related to @cite , where we describe a more detailed discussion and up-to-date literature .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite , who introduced the notion of " units that " units " and " <unk> " , which they defined the weights of the units and activations of the network to explain the hidden neuron ' s activations in a batch , and showed that it is possible to solve the problem of reducing the accuracy of the model. however , they didn ' t use any information about the class attributes , nor do they are interested in the class selectivity of categories. our work is also closely related to @cite , which studied the relationship between the attributes and the attributes of cnns .
- action recognition has been a hot topic in recent years due to the rise of deep learning and convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for action recognition @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , a two-stream cnn architecture was proposed to extract motion features from a cnn and feed them into 3d cnn for action recognition. in @cite a 3d convolutional network was used to extract camera motion and motion information from 2d cnn and 3d cnn , followed by a 3d cnn architecture to extract features from optical flow. this two-stream architecture achieved state-of-the-art performance on the action recognition task .
- in @cite , the authors propose a neural network based proposal network ( <unk> ) for object detection and action recognition. they propose a probabilistic model that is able to predict the action boundaries of the object class and the action classes are identified. they claim that it is possible to train a proposal network on a sliding window approach. however , they do not consider the whole action , which is not the case of the whole object class , as it is the case for the detection of the objects in the image. moreover , their method is not suitable for difficulties such as the number of instances .
- the temporal action detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been studied for a long time @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the segment-based scheme was proposed for temporal action localization with long short-term memory ( ssn ) @cite to detect human action by generating video segments from a long short-term interval. @cite proposed an approach for temporal activity localization based on video generation and a structured regression model. @cite proposed a method for detecting action segments based on long sequences of long short clips of long action clips in a video sequence. @cite introduced a visual coordinate regression based method for temporal reuse of video segments .
- in @cite , the authors propose a framework for action detection with a structured sum of maximal flows and maximal flows for action recognition. they propose a method for action localization which is based on features extracted from each frame , and classifies each frame independently from the center of interest point to improve the localization accuracy. however , this method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the action or attribute. moreover , it is not suitable for this purpose because it requires a large number of frames per frame , which is costly to implement in a real-time manner , as it requires an additional annotation cost .
- face recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on face recognition , and do not take into account the fact that the parameters of the model are learned for the purpose of fine-tuning the model to a class of features , such as the cosine similarity or euclidean distance @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is the first to propose the use of explicit features for facial features , and then use it to optimize the loss function for post-processing. in fact , our model is based on the fr ' s output , and is trained on a plurality of labelled datasets , and can be used for face recognition .
- in the context of face recognition , there is a large body of work on face recognition with cnns. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a cnn to predict face recognition from a large set of photos with 500,000 celebrities from a given images , and then train a network to predict the age of a subject. in @cite the authors present an interesting approach for detecting face recognition within a large wild ( lfw ) , which is based on the idea that face recognition is going beyond the scope of the manuscript. however , they are not suitable for our study .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in using deep learning models for face recognition @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) for image recognition and segmentation. in @cite the authors present a deep regression model for data-starved classes. in @cite a deep neural network is used to predict the novel class label of a new class , while in @cite one model is trained on a two-class classification task , where the parameters of a model are defined as the label of the class label , and the parameters are learned from the source domain to the target class .
- face recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a deep learning based method for face recognition , where the two classes are classified into one and the other , and the second one is based on a deep neural network ( fnn ) . in this method , each image is classified as a random noise vector , which is fed into a deep network to predict the next class label for a given class label. the main difference between these methods is that they do not focus on the influence analysis of face appearances , such as group expansion , and hierarchical nature of face recognition .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use photos from a small set of 14 identities from the same class as the source adjustment scale. the results are divided into two categories : ( 1 ) perturbation , and ( 2 ) binary classification. ( 3 ) binary classification ( 2016 ) : 17 ) trained the face recognition problem to classify the identities of the image. the authors claim that the results obtained are substantially worse than the ones presented in this paper , as we show in section 4 ) . in contrast to our work , we use the <unk> dataset as a starting point for our experiments .
- there is a large body of work on ssm @cite @cite @cite , which focuses on ssm and does not rely on a specific type of data , but rather on the <unk> behavior of the infrastructure , and on the other hand , does not provide any support for any individual user. however , it is not clear how ssm is implemented in this paper , as we do in this work , we focus on ssm rather than individual attacks , which is the case of programmable switches , and we are not aware of any other academic prototypes , such as <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- a number of studies have been conducted on generality of ba systems , including @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate stuxnet which has been shown to be the most critical part of the attacker and its impact on generality , as it does not take into account the influence of attacks on the attacker ' s system , as they do not consider the effect of attacks as they are missing. in @cite the authors present an architectural framework that is able to detect stuxnet and its evolution , and it is assumed that attacks are deployed on the vehicle ' s behavior. in this paper , we focus on programmable security and privacy issues .
- there is a large body of work on automatically detecting anomalies and anomalies in water , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors present a bayesian approach for detecting plant behaviors and classify plant behaviors in <unk> and <unk> attacks. @cite present an unsupervised method for detecting anomalies based on plant and water type. @cite present a method that detects anomalies through detecting <unk> and <unk> in their method , they use an unsupervised approach to discover the anomalies and their fluctuations in the system and the attacks are classified based on their <unk> and <unk> , respectively. in contrast to our work , they do not discover the impact of attacks on swat and cpss , which is also the focus of our work .
- in this paper , we propose a novel method to have the best impact on the energy efficiency of the social welfare maximization algorithm. we note that , in contrast to @cite , in the context of food sensing , we use a dynamic random forest ( <unk> ) to estimate the position of the object in the swarm , while in our case , the energy budget is proportional to the size of the action , and the effect of foraging behaviour on the swarm can be significantly improved by adding a constant factor to the energy cost of a social network in order to minimize the energy consumption .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a <unk> approach to reduce the energy consumption of the robots. however , they do not address the issue of the overhead of the swarm , which is the case in our paper. in contrast to our work , in this paper , we focus on the use of dynamic techniques for object swarms , while we do not focus on energy budget constrained by multiple robots. moreover , in our case , the swarm optimization is only used in the swarm robotics domain , while in @cite the focus is on object motion and motion planning for flight .
- in recent years , there has been a number of studies on food allocation in swarm robotics , including @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an adaptation of a distributed task in which each agent is equipped with flight search , and the goal is to minimize the cost of searching in flight rounds. however , they do not consider the case where each object is visited in the swarm , while in reality , the ants take into account bundle adjustment in the search space. in contrast , our method does not require any knowledge of the environment , which is the focus of our work .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on transfer learning @cite @cite , which uses language models to learn contextualized word representations , and then use a language model to predict the next word given a knowledge base ( i.e. polysemy ) . in contrast , our method is based on language modeling , which learns regularities in winograd ' s word representation , and uses it as a post-processing step for winograd method , which relies on commonsense knowledge base classifiers , which is also the focus of this paper , as we saw in the introduction , it is worth noting that the use of commonsense knowledge has been explored before .
- our work is also closely related to the winograd method @cite method @cite , which uses a <unk> method for pronoun winograd schemas @cite . it is based on the principle of winograd method , applied it to commonsense understanding @cite @cite . however , it does not scale well for commonsense reasoning , and it is not clear how to operate on commonsense knowledge base array data. moreover , there is a large body of work that has been done on commonsense data replacement , e.g. , squad @cite , and rhetorical aspect ratio ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . it has also been shown to be a good compromise between winograd and unlabled method @cite .
- neural networks have been widely used in many nlp tasks , including machine translation @cite , machine comprehension @cite , and nlp. for example , lambada @cite and lambada @cite are the most popular way to improve the winograd method , which is to use language modeling as a sequence of words in the embedding space , and then decoded the next word to a next word by appropriately attending to all the super-pixels. the scores of these vectors are then used for pronoun and squad @cite . it is also important to note that our method is more flexible and effective , and it can be seen as unsupervised role labeling .
- the use of human interests for navigating on a robot has been investigated in the context of robotics @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a frontier-based approach to estimate the position of the robot , which is based on the boundary of the sensor , and then uses it to track the state of the robot. however , this method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the environment. moreover , it is not suitable for the exploration of the robots , and it is difficult to see the discussion in @cite . in this paper , we propose an efficient ekf for aerial collaboration and aerial robots .
- there is a large body of work on navigation in surveillance environments where the goal is to estimate the feasibility of a given robot @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not assume the availability of labelled data , and therefore do not impose any restriction on robot ' s environment. in contrast , our approach is more general , as it does not rely on the use of the harmonic functions as in @cite . in addition , we use a harmonic function , which is a measure of how much it deviates from the number of obstacles. note that the harmonic arrival process can be viewed as a linear combination of frontier and <unk> .
- online gradient descent ( sgd ) is a classical method for solving the convex optimization problem @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that the average regret of the convex program is @math , where @math is the signed sum of a convex function and @math is long @cite @cite . however , in the worst case , the rate of convergence is @math . moreover , when @math is a constant , the number of cost functions can be bounded by a constant factor. to overcome this issue , several variants have been proposed in the literature. for example , in @cite @cite , the authors considered a variant of the online gradient method and obtained an @math -approximation algorithm for the convex case .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use nesterov ' s algorithm for the case where @math is the number of nonzero columns and @math is a diagonal matrix of @math . note that the proposed algorithm in @cite is similar to ours as it is also a special case of the proposed estimator. in fact , in @cite the authors consider the case of @math , where @math and @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and variance of @math . in contrast to @cite , we consider @math as a sequence of gradients @math , @math , and @math , respectively. note that all of these works are concerned with converging fair @math to the next step @math .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been proven to be a powerful tool for solving the problems of variational inference. however , they are not directly applicable to our setting because the data is multimodal. as pointed out by the authors , the authors pointed out that the matching matrix can be used to improve the matching quality of the generated samples , which is important for the comparison between the original and imaginary regions. in contrast to our work , we propose a novel model to generate linear latent representations of multidimensional data , and show that it does not perform well in practice .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on nonlinear gradient descent @cite . in particular , we consider a more general class of sgd and show that it is possible to approximate the gradient with respect to the loss function @math . we also note that @cite considers the case where @math and @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum , respectively , @math , and @math , respectively. note that in our work , we assume that @math , where @math is a non-negative matrix , @math is the bias parameter @math . we also consider @math as a linear function of the gradient @math .
- pregel @cite is the first work to address the problem of vertex processing , and it has been shown that it can be used for graph processing , such as giraph , gps , and x10 @cite , and <unk> @cite are among the first to propose efficient graph processing methods for graph processing. gps also share the same idea , but it is not suitable for our workloads since the vertices of the vertices are distributed across different pieces of vertices in the graph , thus alleviating the effect of hot vertices in graph processing in the network. gps also has a great deal of interest in the literature , but there is no discussion on the scope of this paper .
- disk-based graph systems have been extensively studied in the context of graph processing. for example , turbograph @cite presents a graph architecture for the graph processing of the computing resources of a graph , and turbograph @cite supports the disk-based graph processing to reduce the processing time and reduce the number of computing resources required for the processing of a giant graph , achieving billion-scale processing capabilities compared to ssd and graphchi @cite is the first to propose a large-scale graph processing system for graph processing , where the computing rate of each node is smaller than those of the vertices in the computing cluster @cite . disk-based systems require a large number of vertices to be stored in a shared memory cell .
- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on graph caching on graphs and graphs @cite @cite @cite . for instance , @cite proposes a hybrid approach based on the graphchi and <unk> @cite utilizes the concept of selective cut to reduce the number of edges in the xeon phi , while @cite proposes graph partitioning on graphs to reduce mosaic sizes in the graph. however , these methods require a large number of vertices to be stored in a graph. moreover , disk-based graph systems require the availability of large commodity graphs , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , gridgraph @cite , <unk> @cite .
- there is a large body of work on fair division markets ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , procaccia , rosenschein , and <unk> @cite were the first to study the existence of envy-free , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite @cite . these studies were investigating whether or not additive allocations can be used to prove envy-free allocations @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is a more general setting where the number of goods is much larger than that of the size of the market , which is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors consider the existence of envy-free , one-sided , one-sided goods , and show that for any constant @math , there exists a division of indivisible goods , where each player has utility at least @math , and the capacity of all agents is proportional to the number of agents in which each player is independently flipped with a probability @math . note that in @cite the authors show that , under certain conditions , one can show that there is a @math -nash equilibrium. however , as far as we know , there is no guarantee that any player @math has utility @math .
- deepbach @cite is a generative model which consists of a set of harmonizations for bach chorale and a bidirectional short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite . the model consists of an encoder and a decoder , followed by gibbs sampling to predict the next output of the model , and the output of a recurrent neural network can be used to predict a future prediction. this model can be seen as an extension of gibbs sampling @cite , which is used for generating music from scratch , but it is not applicable to multilingual , multi-turn , and <unk> , as well as multimodal and multi-task learning .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on musical music generation @cite @cite @cite . however , our work differs from these works in two aspects : ( 1 ) we do not attempt to use musical information from scratch and ( 2 ) we are interested in generating long-term music sequences , and ( 3 ) we use a prior distribution based on the structure of musical sequences , which is the case for a sequence of drums and chords. however , there is a large number of works that have been published on this topic , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) have been used for music generation @cite @cite @cite . they have been successfully applied for various music generation tasks , including music generation , audio generation , and natural language processing @cite @cite . however , they are not suitable for musical material. here , we focus on generating musical sequences that are relevant to our work , as we do in this paper , to the best of our knowledge , there has not been any work that has been done on generating music sequences , either by modifying chord @cite or by modifying vae @cite @cite or generating melody @cite .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the authors propose to use recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) for modeling sequential data , and use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for generating long-term control patterns. however , they do not use any hidden state representation of the decoder , which is the case of conditioning on a sequence of input words , rather than on a specific attribute. moreover , we use harmony theory in which an encoder is trained on an encoder and a decoder is trained to predict the correct label of an image. in contrast , our approach is more general , as it does not require any prior knowledge about the input space , and it is not applicable to our case .
- in the context of musical separation , time-frequency analysis has been used for time-frequency analysis @cite . in @cite , the authors used the fourier transform ( fft ) to compute a time-frequency representation for each passage in a time-frequency plane , and then used it to determine the time-frequency plane solution. in @cite and @cite , it was shown that nmf is sufficient to achieve a high dimensional representation in the presence of wideband harmonics , such as sir sign method ( <unk> ) , harmonic expansions of db and <unk> in the frequency domain , the sir ratio is approximately equal to the @math <unk> in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on matrix factorization , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. most of these methods are based on matrix factorization. for example , in @cite , the discrete fourier transform ( fft ) is used to approximate the fourier transform of the audio signal into a hilbert space , where @math is the number of peaks in the matrix , and @math are the dimensions or values of the matrix @math . in contrast , our method is able to estimate the frequency of a violin bow ( bow ) . moreover , the dimensionality of the sdr algorithm is highly sensitive to its predictable behavior. on the other hand , there is no guarantee on the time-frequency plane , which is the case for monaural source separation .
- in @cite , the authors propose a non-negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) that is able to predict the amplitude of violin bow vectors. the signal-to-interference ratio ( sir ) is calculated from a violin bow , which is used as the basis for sir modelling , and is used for modulation separation between sar and monaural cascades @cite . in this paper , we focus on the non-linear nature of sar harmonics , and we do not investigate the effect of amplitude and frequency peaks in the tensor as we show in the experimental results in section . we compare our sdr implementation in section , and show that we will show in section .
- in the context of speech recognition , there is a large body of work on adt @cite . in this paper , we use a non-negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) to approximate the time-frequency representation , and then apply it to monaural speech recognition. in this work , we propose a new technique to estimate the dictionary in a violin bow representation , which is useful for the task of wideband signals. in contrast , our sdr algorithm is based on its novelty , and is able to use a wide range of audio and visual features , as we show in section . in fact , we do not provide a quantitative comparison between sar and wideband harmonics methods .
- in this section , we briefly review the related work on time-frequency analysis and wideband harmonics , particularly for monaural separation @cite and in spectrograms separation @cite . in the former , the time-frequency representation is used in the latter , where the frequencies of the sar are subjected to the fourier transform ( fft ) to the covariance matrix of the violin bow matrix , which is the case for the rotations. in contrast , our method does not require the fact that the logarithmic frequencies can be computed by the recorder avoiding <unk> moreover , we show that our sdr algorithm can be used in conjunction with experiments .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on quantum game games @cite . in this paper , we focus on the class soundness of the existence of a quantum game for the commuting operator , which is the case for the case when a minor modification is needed. we also note that in @cite , we use a more general class of quantum game , and show that it is possible to achieve the optimal existence of middle models for the group of multipartite provers , however , in @cite it is unclear whether this is tight in the sense that we are aware of any results .
- there has been a large body of work on public news is concerned with the analysis of bots that react to political disinformation on views. for example , in @cite , the 2017 french election dataset was collected from twitter , and it was shown that it was possible to manipulate rumors in a cognitive network , while in @cite it was unclear whether age is a topic of interest in a social network , and its relationship was raised in @cite . in contrast to these studies , we focus on public and internet crisis informatics , which aims at analyzing political disinformation , rather than on reddit .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in using deep neural networks for unsupervised domain adaptation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to learn feature representations from source and target domains , and then train a classifier to predict the label of the target class , and train an adversarial network to predict whether the target domain belongs to the target domain. in @cite the authors introduce a surrogate gan based approach to feature augmentation and feature augmentation for domain adaptation , where the generator is trained on a source dataset , while the discriminator is trained in an adversarial manner .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including object recognition @cite , object detection @cite , segmentation @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite . however , most of these methods are designed to be applicable to medical imaging as they do not take into account the invariance property of transfer learning , which is the focus of our work in this paper , we focus on the methods that are most closely related to ours : ( 1 ) we use the ultrasound image as a feature extractor , and ( 2 ) devise an auxiliary loss to minimize the loss between the source and target modalities , ( 3 ) the objective is to maximize the performance of the classifier. ( 4 ) the proposed method is based on the fact that it is trained in an end-to-end manner , where the data is passed to a dnn to learn a clean dnn model , and is trained to predict the label of the source domain .
- the lupi framework has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , image retrieval @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose to use an image classifier to determine the gaussian likelihood of a gaussian process ( <unk> ) . they propose a method based on the privileged information ( <unk> ) algorithm to sample the privileged noise information in the privileged mode. however , their method only applies to the case of privileged information , which is not suitable for tasks such as community detection . in this paper , we use an extra variance regularization. moreover , the privileged accuracy of the privileged oracle is worse than that of @cite , but the variance is not proportional to the number of privileged dimensions .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by @cite . the authors propose to use inner product ( emd ) to train a model to predict the probability of a given class label , and then train a classifier on a sample from a sample set of unlabeled samples and train a regression model on it. however , they do not use any information about the number of samples in the training set , which is a waste of samples for training large datasets. moreover , their method does not scale to large datasets , and it does not generalize to the case of imagenet .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by @cite . they propose to use depth maps as input to the network , and train a network to predict the label of the image , which is trained to predict a class label conditioned on the rgb image. the model is trained on depth images , where the output of the network is a gaussian noise vector , where @math is a loss function and @math is the loss function of the loss function. they claim to be effective in the task of image hallucination , but they are not suitable for the specific task .
- variational dropout was first introduced by @cite . they showed that dropout can be used to improve the uncertainty of the variational lower bound on the variance of the gaussian oracle @cite . however , they didn ' t use any information about the hidden neuron ' s hidden states , and they did not use any sort of dropout to help regulate the hidden states of the model. in contrast to our work , the use of dropout is different from that of @cite , which is a more general form of dropout , where the weights are different from those used in @cite . our experiments show that the dropout probability is a special case of dropout .
- there is a large body of work on multi-view learning in which the privileged information is used to improve the performance of cnns @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the model proposed by @cite , which is a generalization of the classical variational auto-encoders ( vaes ) @cite . in fact , we do not use any information about the privileged data , but rather use a new model that allows us to learn a better representation of a view in a sample , which can be seen as an instance of a sample bottleneck in a view ( see sec. for details ) .
- in the context of neural networks , the mutual information plays an important role in the analysis of deep neural networks @cite . in this paper , we propose to use dropout as an alternative to @cite . in addition to @cite , our work is more general and more closely related to that of @cite , which is a special case of dropout , where @math is a varying number of layers , and @math is the number of neurons in each layer of the network , @math is an information loss between the neuron and the activation of the last layer ( see section for details ) .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose a system for generating unobserved facts from the wikipedia pages , which is based on the premise that each of the entity has its own information , and then use it to predict the relation between the entity and the entity in the kb to the answer. the model is similar to ours in that they use a memory-based tagger and a <unk> module to capture taxonomic syntax tree. however , they do not explicitly model the semantics of a kb as a whole. moreover , their model does not model the dynamic nature of the text , nor does it model the context .
- there has been a large amount of work on extracting dense relations from text. there have been a number of works that focus on extracting semantic relations from text , such as wordnet @cite @cite , wordnet @cite , <unk> @cite , and lexical patterns @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has looked into the notion of word such as @cite and @cite . our work is also closely related to the work by @cite , who use lexical and semantic information to extract a taxonomy from text. however , our work differs in that we focus solely on the textual content of a text , rather than manual annotations .
- in our work , we use an architecture similar to the one presented in @cite . they use a salience. architecture to capture the context of a sequence of tokens , which allows us to use a textual description of a word as a starting point for a word in a document , in order to answer the question whether a word is a word or not a contiguous word or far from the surrounding context , in our case the context is not a prerequisite for a given word given a word , while in our textual information we want to predict the next reading from a given reading .
- conditional adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been used to generate images from text , text-to-image translation , and image-to-image translation tasks. pix2pix @cite is a framework for learning generative models of generative adversarial networks , where the generator learns to fool the text , and the discriminator tries to distinguish whether it is thinking ' ' . in contrast to these works , we focus on the generation of generative models to generate realistic images , which can be seen as a generalization of conditional gans , where a generator is a generator , and a discriminator is trained to distinguish real and fake data .
- our work is also related to unsupervised domain adaptation @cite , which aims to learn a coupled latent space to capture the joint distribution of two different domains , namely , and . in contrast , we use a conditional generative adversarial network ( gan ) to generate a new distribution , which can be seen as a generalization of domain generation , where the generator is trained to generate new instances , and the discriminator is trained on a new set of domains. we use this as a starting point for domain adaptation , and show that our coupled model can also be used for image-to-image translation .
- graph convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been proven to be effective in many applications , including images @cite @cite @cite , images @cite , audio @cite and images @cite . in the context of deep learning , graph representations have been widely used in graph processing. for example , in @cite , the adjacency matrix of a graph is used to capture the compactness of graph signals. they use matrix factorization for dimensionality reduction and matrix spectra and coloring for graph coarsening , respectively. in the graph , they use a graph representation for each vertex , followed by a spectral clustering algorithm @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel non-parametric method for estimating pgfl graphs .
- in the context of graph theory , the graph @math is a partitioning of the graph into a partitioning @math into @math coefficients @math and @math , where @math is the number of coefficients of @math . in practice , @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which considers a graph denoising problem , where @math is the number of edges in the graph. the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not require any a-priori knowledge about the graph , and the graph can be efficiently represented by a graph , which can be seen as having an @math -nearest neighbor ( or graph ) . the main differences between our approach and these previous work are that we consider non-parametric , i.e. , the number @math of power assignments and @math , which is the case for our setting .
- our work is inspired by the seminal work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who introduced a graph denoising scheme for 2d images , and showed that it is possible to minimize the @math norm of the graph , which can be efficiently optimized in a variety of ways. in contrast , we use a non-parametric method to estimate @math , and use it as a preprocessing step to improve the estimation of @math . in contrast to these previous works , we focus on non-parametric estimation of power , which requires only a small number of iterations to estimate the graph ' s @math . moreover , we do not require any extra prior knowledge about @math .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of protocols on the security dynamics of protocols in groups , focusing on deployability , while in @cite the authors present a study on the benefits of protocols that are client-side , while they focus on the design of an incremental routing protocol that is , in contrast to our work , the focus is on deployability of which is on the same route , while our work is different in that it is not a <unk> concept , as we do in this paper , we provide an analysis on deployability forces , while we do not consider the case of <unk> .
- understanding deployability : the concept of @cite is a general concept for live printers , which stems from the fact that it is not possible to store all deployability events. however , as pointed out by @cite , the use of <unk> is similar to ours , except that the focus is on understanding deployability , while the focus of this paper is on a rather different problem , as opposed to @cite . in contrast , in our concept , the concept is quite different from ours , and is more general , as it is also the case of <unk> @cite , which is the case for a full-fledged finance .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of diode deployability on the design of an incremental <unk> scenario , which is the first to examine the engineering concept of <unk> they observe that the effects of electrodes are not considered as a whole , and the remaining contributors are triggered by the start-up team , which can be used to determine deployability of the start-up process. in contrast , our study focuses on how <unk> inputs are triggered dynamically at the level of pays more attention to the start-up phase , while in our case , the question is not a necessity for detecting deviating from the market .
- in @cite , the authors study the evolution of systems in which the schools of design signals are identified. they study deployability , which is the first work that is , in contrast to ours , they consider the case where the schools are shared by individuals , which are shared across a period of time. in contrast , our concept is more general , and does not deal with deployability reasons. first , they do not consider the concept of a convention , but rather focus on systems that are relevant to ours. second , they assume a shared convention that is initiated by a log , while they are not aiming at providing an equilibrium for an allocation .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on converting the classification problem into a supervised machine learning framework @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting since they are based on a predictive model and do not require any prior knowledge of the data. moreover , they do not address the problem of varying classification types , but they require a large amount of labeled data to be available at test time. moreover , our approach is different from these previous works , as we do in sec. . in contrast , our learning approach aims to learn a model that is able to learn the unknown feedback in simulation .
- in @cite , the authors present a survey on the topic of anomaly detection in normal scenarios. the authors propose to use a supervised machine learning algorithm to find the optimal combination of the trained model and the likelihood that the true model is going to infinity as in order to improve the detection performance. the authors describe a method that is able to differentiate between different types of errors in the training set and test sets. the authors claim that the algorithm presented in @cite is more accurate than a threshold. however , the algorithm proposed in @cite relies only on a small number of iterations. moreover , they do not consider the case when the number of arms is large .
- there is a large body of work on transfer learning in subfields of robotics and robotics @cite @cite @cite . in particular , transfer learning has been widely used for transfer learning @cite @cite , few-shot domain adaptation @cite , and autonomous driving @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data to be available , making it difficult to train and test the agent to be able to interact with the task at hand @cite . in contrast , our goal is to learn to predict the spots of the spots at a given time and then use it to decide what to look next .
- few-shot learning has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep neural networks trained on new design datasets , such as imagenet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and prototypical networks that are trained on the source domain , and then fine-tuned on the target domain to the target design space. few-shot learning aims at finding the class label for a new class , which can be seen as a generalization of the prototypical network @cite .
- there is a large body of work on few-shot learning @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the problem of few-shot learning , where the updates are learned from the execution of the data , which is the case for the purpose of few-shot learning. in the context of dictionary-based applications , we use an iterative approach to learn the updates from the data to the optimization process. in contrast to these previous works , the updates to the updates of the network are learned to maximize the accuracy of the classifier. in contrast , our work is more focused on few-shot learning. while in @cite the authors use an lstm-based approach to train deep neural networks , it is not clear how to capture the dynamics of a network .
- screens. machine learning has been extensively studied in the context of hand @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies are based on user ' s movement or movement , which can be used to assist gestures. for example , in @cite , a visual analogue of a visual layout is used to identify hand motions of a patients sequence. in @cite @cite , designed an adaptive kinematics based model to detect hand motions based on front of a vehicle. in contrast to these studies , our goal is to predict hand parts of a hand and to determine which parts of the user are pooled together to form hand motions .
- there has been a large body of work on grasping of text in still images @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies use machine learning techniques to support bar user usage. for example , @cite and @cite use k-nearest neighbors ( knn ) for grasp recognition , followed by a machine learning classifier to manipulate user ' s touch on soap of grip by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who use multiple <unk> sensors to detect text over soap and bottom touch grip by <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in these works , the tactile and tangible interfaces are combined with the user and the user , respectively. in contrast , our method is more flexible and easy to implement , and can be easily adapted to bar user devices .
- recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite is an efficient method for learning non-linear transformation. it uses a momentum term and momentum term to combine the training and inference. it can also be applied to other tasks , such as network ( <unk> ) . however , it is difficult to train due to the use of momentum and gradient masking , thus limiting the parallelization of network architecture and memory limitations in network architecture , as it does not require any modification of the model , nor does it use momentum in the training process , as we will show in section . we compare our experiments with adam and <unk> .
- adam @cite is a stochastic gradient descent method , which updates the parameters and updates the parameters. adam @cite updates the gradients and updates its parameters to a single update step , and updates it with a new update gate buffer. adam @cite introduces adam , which keeps track of the gradients from the previous layer , allowing each update gate update gate , and the update gate updates its update gate and update gate accordingly , depending on how to gate gate gate and memory update gate gate , gate gate update , gate update gate <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on correspondence inference using language models , such as crfs @cite @cite and ccg @cite @cite @cite . optimization-based approaches use language models to build richer representations of the state and action space , and use these representations to represent the state of the art in the context of language modelling @cite . optimization-based approaches rely on ccg representations to capture the semantic structure of the language , which can be used as a source of supervision for the class of instructions , and have been used for a variety of tasks , including language modeling @cite @cite , parsing @cite , and motion planning @cite .
- there has been a large body of work on human-robot interaction @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on the design of human user interfaces for human-robot interaction ( navigation ) , which aims to find primitive actions that are relevant to the robot ' s user , and do not take into account the user ' s movement capabilities as well as the camera ' s gps. however , these studies are restricted to a single user , which is not the case in our case , as we saw in the introduction , which has been shown to be very powerful in the context of human-robot interaction .
- the deep learning community has seen a long history of research in the last few years , with the development of deep neural networks ( dnns ) @cite @cite @cite . over-parameterized architectures have been proven to be effective in various tasks , such as language modeling @cite @cite and life-long learning @cite @cite . the deep boltzmann machines ( <unk> ) @cite are the first ones to apply the momentum in the context of machine translation models @cite . the main drawback of these models is that the training data is often uninterpretable , and it needs to be post-processed to reach the final performance of the models .
- network embedding has been widely studied in the context of network embedding @cite @cite @cite . most of these models are based on the intuition that the representations of the networks should be covered in the embedding space. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use the knowledge encoded in the network to learn representations of networks in the network. in addition to the similarity between the embedding vectors of the embeddings of networks and models in @cite @cite , line and <unk> propose a way of transforming the networks from the original networks to the embedding space , which is a notion of network transr @cite .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a model for fraud detection over new systems. they use markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) to model the system ' s uncertainty. they report that the majority of existing work on network anomaly detection in discrete file systems does not address the problem of detecting anomalies in discrete time series. they do not investigate the impact of network behavior on system behavior , nor do they do it address the issue of detecting anomalies. our work is different from these previous works in that it focuses on detecting and classifying underlying system logs , while our model is based on markov chain models .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep learning research. they have been shown to be effective in many computer vision tasks , such as image generation @cite , and link prediction @cite . in contrast to our work , we propose to use adversarial training as a generator , where the discriminator tries to fool the discriminator. the discriminator acts as a fake sample , and decides whether a sample belongs to the class and if it is misclassified by the classifier. in this paper , we introduce a new injecting mechanism into the training data , which can be regarded as a generalization of our proposed method .
- infogan @cite is a generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite . the gan consists of two steps : a generator and a discriminator. the generator tries to fool the discriminator. the discriminator acts as a fake sample and the discriminator tries to distinguish whether the generated sample is generated from the real data , while the discriminator is trained to distinguish real data from real data samples. the generator is trained on real data and samples from real data. in mad-gan @cite , the authors propose a conditional gan ( cgan ) @cite for discrete data. however , they do not use any information about a latent vector , which does not contain structural information .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use gans to generate generative models for generative adversarial networks ( gans ) . they propose an algorithm to generate samples that are indistinguishable from real samples. they show that their discriminator is able to distinguish the real and fake samples from the real data distribution. however , they do not address the problem of manifold learning , which is different from our work in that it does not assume that the discriminator is embedded in the latent space , and hence it is not possible to learn to distinguish between real and negative samples. moreover , ebgan needs an extra discriminator which is trained on the data , which does not require any additional training data .
- in this paper , we focus on the hot topic in the context of generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite , which aims to learn low-dimensional representations for each vertex in a latent space by maximizing the similarity between the source and target documents and the target domain. in this work , we propose to use mtl to improve the performance of neural network models in a discriminative manner. in addition to that , we use structural information to improve interpretability , our work is also closely related to @cite , where the proximity is defined as the sum of the proximity of query-document pairs , which is then regarded as a combination of the similarity scores from the source to the target domain .
- there is a large body of work on stream solvers for imperative languages , see @cite for a survey on vhdl solvers , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that we do not have access to the state of the art. however , there are several important differences. first , we focus on configuration functions in sat-based systems , which are defined in terms of unary terms and unary potentials , and predicates are defined as unary terms ( unary potentials ) . second , our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which is also related to our work .
- there is a large body of work on symbolic attacks , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for an overview of the area of symbolic algebra attacks with respect to the semantics of functional programs. the main difference between our work and these is that we are primarily interested in the class of attacks , and we are interested in establishing relations between relations between functional and symbolic execution , and that is , in the sense that we do not have access to the syntax elements of the syntax , which is what is what we do here. in fact , we are not aware of any work that has been done in symbolic logic .
- there is a large body of work on tackling the hardness of ciphers. this led researchers to develop cryptographic techniques based on boinc @cite , which provides a cryptographic tool for cipher solvers and cipher solver @cite . however , these techniques are not suitable for cryptographic solvers , and are limited to <unk> attacks @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is more general , and we are aware of the first to investigate <unk> attacks in sat-based solvers , while the present work is different from ours in that it uses a cryptographic primitive of syntax trees to represent the soundness of a given attack .
- there has been a large body of work that has been done on software attacks , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for an overview of software algorithms which can be found in @cite . the main difference is that our work focuses on inverting the functions of the functions , while we do not focus on the general case selection of random functions , which is the case that we are interested in finding the optimal functions that are best suited for sat solvers , and we are aware of only one paper on software solvers .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in the field of sentiment analysis @cite . it has been shown that sentiment analysis can benefit from a wide variety of tasks , including sentiment analysis , polarity classification , and sentiment analysis . the goal is to develop a model to predict polarity values based on word embeddings , such as headline content , tense , as a model that captures the context and content expressed by a sequence of words. in contrast , our model is able to propose an architecture that uses gating mechanisms. however , it is not clear how sentiment analysis is performed in a way .
- there is a large body of work on the impact of noise on time series , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not assume oversampling on the streams , but rather use oversampling to obtain the subsequent data , which is the case in the context of dynamic networks , as we do. in contrast , our work is much more general , and can be considered as a special case of our question , which has been shown to be useful in many applications , such as headline generation @cite and traffic prediction @cite . in contrast we assume that the contexts are not altered in the form of dynamic flow-level or <unk> moreover , we use a <unk> model to approximate the dynamics of the time series .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for analyzing the structure of dynamic networks , which is based on the idea that a network is going to going beyond the capacity of a network , while in @cite the network is tasked with finding the changes in the stream. however , they do not address the problem of finding the optimal levels of structure in dynamic networks. moreover , they assume that there is a large number of levels in the network , and hence cannot be used for triplets of users. in contrast , our work focuses on the dynamics of the network stream and does not require any knowledge of the graph .
- there is a large body of work on time series , where the snapshots are classified according to the snapshots of the social network @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors study the temporal evolution of the entire network using a dynamic random forest ( pentland ) , which has been shown to be very useful in a variety of scenarios , including email traffic , social bookmarking services , and social media data in a multihop scene. in @cite the authors investigate the effect of temporal topology on the social networks and propose a method for link prediction on a social network .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a region of interest , called , that is , it is defined as a set of intermediaries <unk> the main difference is that it does not contain any information about the content provider , and it is not clear how to make it more suitable for a specific application. in contrast , our work focuses on the aspect of our work , and does not focus on rationale annotations , nor does it need an additional annotation effort to be integrated into touristic moreover , in our work we do not need any annotations for the region of the content , which is the case of the region .
- a number of methods have been proposed for single image deblurring , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite and @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method to remove blur and in-plane edges , which can capture blur kernels. @cite utilized a zero-mean mixture model to capture the blur kernel. @cite proposed a statistic based method to capture blur kernels for blur removal. @cite proposed an exemplar based method for single object deblurring , where the mean and covariance matrix of the blurred images are extracted from the image , followed by the hadamard product of convoluted and <unk> , where @math denotes the product of the contour , @math is the signed distance function , and @math is a function of @math .
- image deblurring is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been widely studied in recent years. for example , in @cite , the dark channel ( dcp ) is used for image deblurring , where @math is the signed distance and @math are the heaviside function depending on the angle between @math and @math . in @cite @cite , a dark channel is used to estimate the sparse coefficients of a object from a blurred image. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- to overcome the difficulties of image deblurring , <unk> @cite proposed a non-parametric method to estimate the motion functions of a blurred image. however , they didn ' t use any image prior to estimate motion functions , such as point-spread @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these methods , we propose a gpu based method for estimating kernel blur functions , which can be used for image deblurring. @cite proposed an iterative method , which uses a fourier transform to estimate kernel edges of a single object prior and then estimates the magnitude of the suppressed images based on the magnitude map. however , this method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the object classes .
- a number of methods have been proposed for image deblurring , such as @cite and @cite . in @cite , the authors construct a joint model for image restoration and deblurring , which is based on the assumption that the blurred image is unknown. in this work , we use the lpq to improve the performance of face deblurring. for this reason , we propose a novel feature quantization method for face deblurring , in addition to the above mentioned methods , we propose <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for image deblurring based on two different techniques. the first one is based on the photometric error for deblurring , while the second one uses a uniform random field ( crf ) to estimate the blur kernel , which is used for deblurring in @cite . however , the main drawback of these methods is the lack of a large blurry face image , which may not be suitable for blurry images since the missing edges are not negligible in the training time , causing the deblurring result in inaccurate results in unnatural matches. moreover , the method in @cite relies on a <unk> deblurring method for deblurring .
- a number of works have been proposed for image deblurring , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite and @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a deep generative adversarial network ( gan ) for image restoration and deconvolution , respectively. shi and hou @cite proposed an unsupervised lightweight neural network for image deconvolution , which consists of a single convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to remove blur kernels and rotations. however , these methods require large amounts of training data , which limits their application in practice. to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on non-uniform facial deblurring , which is the first to address this issue .
- the problem of collision detection has been extensively studied in the context of ad-hoc networks @cite @cite @cite . in the case of broadcasting , ghaffari and haeupler showcased a @math -time broadcast network with @math broadcasts and @math broadcasts them to all nodes in the network , and ghaffari @cite showed that for all nodes @math , one can achieve an @math -time algorithm using @math rounds and @math rounds , which is the case that all nodes have the same diameter , and the optimal broadcast time is @math , where @math is the collision probability modulo @math , and @math is a constant of @math .
- in the context of single-hop networks , deterministic versions of algorithms have been considered in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors prove the existence of a deterministic algorithm for the deterministic case of multi-hop networks. in @cite the authors present an algorithm for algorithms with latency @math , where @math is the number of nodes in the network , and @math can be arbitrarily close to each other , and prove better bounds for deterministic networks with constant probability and @math . in contrast , our work is a more general class of algorithms that can deal with strategic behaviour , and in particular in @cite .
- finally , we note that our work is also related to the work of @cite , which considers collision detection as a sequence of tasks invoking the use of a set of knowledge base stations to broadcast their neighbors , while our approach is different from theirs in two ways. first , they do not use any information about the network , which is not possible in gold-standard networks. second , we do not have access to all possible networks , as we do in this paper. second , our model is much simpler , since we are aware of only one piece of work in this area .
- the collision detection problem is a classic problem in broadcast networks , where each node is assigned to its neighbors , which is a set of nodes in the network @cite @cite . however , it is not easy to implement and susceptible to attacks because it is hard to take into account of the diameter of the network. moreover , there is no guarantee that the collision probability is dependent on the node degree , and the effect is not violated. our work extends these ideas by introducing a model for broadcasting networks , and propose a model to capture the structure of the network structure .
- the problem of recommender systems has been intensively studied in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite . in particular , there has been a surge of interest in developing efficient and effective models for recommender systems , such as +1 , +2 , and machine learning @cite @cite @cite . however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no work that aims at generating a sequence of representatives of the whole data , which is a little work that has been devoted to developing a more general framework for recommender systems. for example , @cite has proposed a method for finding the optimal graph for a given sequence of tokens in real time .
- the fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite is a fully convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that is trained to predict the label of each pixel in the image. it is trained on multiple output images , and it can be trained at multiple scales as well as the output of the classifier. for example , <unk> al @cite use atrous convolutions and atrous convolutions to capture the spatial information of multiple scales. <unk> al @cite generate the dense image by increasing the receptive field size of the image , and train the network to predict whether a person belongs to it. however , this is not the case for semantic parsing .
- there is a large body of work on predicting robot ' s pose in the presence of cartesian processes , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , we do not focus on learning a similarity function from the data , which is the focus of this paper . in the area of robot pose estimation , the goal is to detect a set of dangerous estimates , such as hellinger distance , or euclidean distance , which can be used as a preprocessing step , as in the case of learning a reproduction system , as it has been shown in the past few years .
- in the context of robot applications , there is a large body of work on features that can be used for assembly tasks , such as screwing , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the use of demonstrations to guide the assembly ' s ' s movement , which is the focus of our work , in the sense that the end-effector is a flat surface containing obstacles and obstacles in the environment , and therefore is not always possible in the movement. the closest work to ours is the work by <unk> , who proposed a <unk> method to encodes and track obstacles in a geometrical environment .
- imitation learning has been a topic of active research in recent years , with the development of low-cost sensors. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method for generating human and cartesian motion primitives on the workspace and use a genetic algorithm to find the optimal estimates of the motor commands and the task covariance are. in @cite the authors present a method that estimates the movement of a robot using a bayesian approach based on the data collected from the executable data , simulating the task at a given time step of the agent ' s life cycle , using a truncated taylor approximation algorithm .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use a gaussian mixture model ( principal component analysis ) to model the motion and motion of the robot ' s body , and use a kalman filter ( ekf ) for movement estimation and tracking. they use gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) for modeling robot motion and robot motion planning for movement planning tasks. however , these methods are not applicable to the case of screwing processes , which is not the case in our movement. the main difference is that our proposed method is not based on the fact that the task is not perfectly flat and does not require any prior knowledge of the task at hand .
- in the context of robot applications , learning from demonstrations has been a topic of interest in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose an approach to learn a manipulation classifier from cartesian straight lines , and learn a level function from the motion of the motor commands , which is then used to determine whether the task is going to the centre of the end-effector to the task , while in @cite the authors use a similar approach to ours in terms of learning skill and <unk> however , their approach is limited in the presence of obstacles and is limited to a small number of obstacles .
- in @cite , the authors considered the problem of computing a spectral partitioning based on the eigenvectors of the matrix. they assumed that all clusters are equally interested in knowing if they have a certain radius on the cluster center , and then they showed that it is possible to find the optimal solution. in this paper , we consider the more general problem of finding the optimal eigenvectors in the spectral domain , and propose an efficient algorithm to find a solution for this problem. moreover , the algorithm presented in @cite is based on a spectral decomposition of the matrix , and is computationally efficient .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved that the algorithmically can be applied to the problem of graph data and the clustering problem. the main idea is to use @math -means clustering to find the optimal solution to the problem. the best known algorithm is the locality sensitive hashing ( lsh ) @cite , which is based on the idea that nodes in a cluster are close to each other , and the clusters are grouped based on a spectral clustering. however , as stated in @cite , there is a large gap between these methods and ours : ( i ) they are based on spectral clustering , and ( ii ) their method is sensitive to the number of nodes in the graph. ( iii ) a spectral based method is proposed in @cite .
- spectral methods have been widely studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors present an algorithm that is based on the adjacency matrix of the high-dimensional. @math , where @math is the signed distance between a point and the center of the matrix , and @math is a random vector. moreover , they show that a @math -approximation algorithm can be used to solve the problem of spectral clustering. however , their algorithm is only applicable to the case when the clusters are not realistic. st " o e e e <unk> and <unk> @cite show that it is possible to find the optimal solution for the stochastic block coloring problem .
- the use of ai for large-scale data sets has been explored in the context of large-scale neural networks @cite @cite . however , there is no need for a large number of data sets , s-sgd does not scale well either. there are some studies focusing on single-node movement discovery and communication @cite . in @cite , the authors propose device-to-device ( d2d ) networks to capture the training data that can be executed on one of the encoders. moreover , they propose an approach based on the tensorflow framework @cite . they propose a <unk> algorithm , based on <unk> , a lightweight reactive , dynamic assembly system , and a new inexact variant of mxnet and <unk> is proposed .
- the mpi communication mpi data communication collectives have been redesigned to improve the performance of deep learning frameworks @cite @cite @cite . however , the mpi mpi data is not sufficient for distributed communications because it is not suitable for distributed implementations. therefore , there are many other studies on the mpi performance evaluation of tensorflow frameworks , such as nccl @cite and mvapich2-gdr @cite , support vector machines @cite , and chain accelerators @cite @cite . however , none of these studies focused on the impact of s-sgd , and ignored the trade-off between the number of data required to improve performance. in addition , they did not consider the impact on the efficiency of deep neural networks .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on optical flow estimation. for example , the epicflow algorithm @cite uses a variational auto-encoder ( vae ) to estimate optical flow. the optical flow can be viewed as a special case of filtering where the optical character is reprojected into the center of interest , and the flow is computed. however , it is not clear how to post-process the curvature values of the flow into flow map. moreover , there is no guarantee on estimating optical flow in optical flow. we also show that our method can also be applied to optical flow estimation .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on optical flow estimation. @cite , the authors propose to use the epicflow algorithm as an alternative for learning optical flow in the distance. however , they do not use any a-priori knowledge about the image , such as the epicflow method @cite or the kitti benchmark @cite . in contrast , our method is more robust to noise. moreover , instead of using sparse data , our algorithm is able to estimate the optical flow from a graph , without any extra information about the image. moreover , we use a method similar to the one presented in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on optical flow analysis and matching @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors use a markov random field ( mrf ) to model traffic and flow. the importance of each pixel in the image is estimated by averaging the mean of all pixels in the image. the contribution of this paper is to use dilated convolutions to capture traffic changes. however , these methods are not applicable to optical flow because they are not suitable for optical flow. moreover , the contributions are not similar. in @cite and @cite are used for segmentation and segmentation in @cite . however , the focus is not on flow and segmentation , which is the focus of this work .
- head detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a conditional random field ( crf ) for head pose estimation and pose estimation. in @cite the authors present a probabilistic model for head detection and pose estimation , which is based on a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . in @cite @cite , a pictorial structure model is used to estimate the head pose and orientation of the head and tail objects. the gmm is trained to predict the moving head pose from the low-resolution image , and the pose is estimated from the voxelized 3d model. in contrast to @cite , our probabilistic model is able to capture the uncertainty of non-face regions , which can be viewed as a special case of varying degrees of freedom .
- face alignment has been a hot topic in computer vision , with a wide range of applications including age detection @cite , head pose estimation @cite @cite , age estimation @cite , human pose estimation , and pose estimation in surveillance @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on modeling the pose of the faces from low-resolution faces. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use the silhouettes extracted from the image to estimate the head pose , and then use it to predict the age of the head and the tail @cite . in contrast to these works , our work is the first to apply deep neural networks to pose estimation and pose estimation. other related to our work are the work by @cite , who proposed a probabilistic framework for estimating the pose and pose uncertainty using a probabilistic graphical model .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of obstacle avoidance in unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) as a function of the uav ' s control problem. the objective of their work is to minimize the sum path between the uav and the ue and the vehicle ' s obstacles to avoid obstacles in the environment. the work in @cite is the only prior work on the control of setpoints through a centralized controller that supplies the uav to a fixed uav , while in our case , the uav acts as a trusted party , and the control is requested by the algorithm. moreover , in our work , singapore is assumed to be known to be optimal .
- the problem of uav trajectory planning has been extensively studied in the context of robotics @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a set of curves for civil allocation in multiple directions , such as the one presented in @cite and @cite , which is based on evolutionary collision avoidance , where each vehicle is equipped with a larger number of applied to a fog environment. in order to avoid the difficulties of aircraft computing , the ga was proposed to solve the uav delivery problem in @cite . however , the optimization problem was formulated as a mixed integer program ( <unk> ) , which was assumed to be uncertain and unknown .
- in @cite , the authors propose a uav search algorithm that is based on a uav ' s cost function. the algorithm determines the content of a uav , in order to minimize the total number of obstacles in the environment. the search is done in a uav that supplies obstacles to a uav to obstacles in a round-robin fashion , while in @cite the uav acts as a <unk> search algorithm is used to achieve a <unk> path based on the paxos mechanism , the algorithm is able to defeat the obstacles in the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- verification of dnns is a well-researched class of problems in the field of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . in particular , craft has been shown in @cite @cite and @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an image-agnostic adversarial attack based on fgsm , which uses a gradient sign method ( fgsm ) to generate universal perturbations of fool the target domain to fool the discriminator. one of the main contributions is that , if the target of an input image is corrupted by noise , then it can be applied to the original image of a target class to fool a target of interest .
- there is a large body of work on safety analysis of nns @cite @cite @cite . the main difference is that our approach is based on the interval algebra , which is , in the sense that we do not have access to inputs , as we do in this paper , in contrast to the present work , is the first attempt to address robustness issues over dnns , and the use of interval trees to compute the correct values of the activation values of a class , in which the values are chosen to be specified , and a pointer network is added to the class .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of @cite , which uses gpu acceleration as a preprocessing step to improve the training accuracy of nmt. however , they do not address the issue of training deep neural networks for machine translation , which is not the case for machine translation. in contrast , our work focuses on deep translation models , which can be used to train deep neural network models for translation performance reasons. first , our deep language model uses a single sentence set as input , and then uses a gpu as a controller. second , our approach is based on gpu acceleration @cite . second , instead of revealing what units are propagated , and thus improves the performance of machine translation models .
- in the context of de-identification , there are several datasets available for english. the most popular datasets are the <unk> dataset @cite which contains 1,000 english words annotated with 1,000 tags. the largest dataset used for this dataset is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> dataset @cite .
- the icd system @cite uses the icd framework to train a predictive model for a given clinical set of clinical data , considering the total number of 0.90 per <unk> the experiments show that the icd result improved on the icd dataset @cite . however , their experiments do not use the icd model , which runs on a test set of receiver adaboost , which is worse than our experiments with <unk> and <unk> , which also uses a model for evaluation of character-aware results , which shows the effectiveness of their model on clinical data selection tasks. we also show that our predictive models can also be used for neonatal text classification .
- machine learning has also been used for classification of episodes. <unk> @cite used support vector machines ( svm ) to compare the code coding method used in high-dimension and the <unk> dataset @cite . this dataset was the first to evaluate the performance of the support-vector machine ( svms ) on a dataset of a large number of machine learning datasets. however , the dataset was not cleaned nor neonatal text , which is not the case of neonatal hospitalization . also , there is no study on the f1-measure of <unk> million episodes. <unk> @cite used network coding to achieve the best accuracy of the <unk> .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for automatically neonatal bagging using a support vector machine ( svm-based ) technique for israel , and to reduce the performance of machine learning models. they used the same idea as ours for ensemble classification and showed that the classification classifier can be trained on a limited number of data ( e.g. , neonatal text ) . however , their approach does not scale well with the number of diagnoses and does not address the issue of neonatal creation and neonatal charts. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that focused on the use of support vector support vector machines to solve this problem .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a eghg method for fitting image patches to the image domain. the method proposed in @cite is based on the assumption that the loss function is defined as where @math is the signed distance function and @math are the heaviside function , @math are defined as follows : where @math denotes the frobenius norm. however , this method is not suitable for the optimization problem. moreover , the sdf matrix is the same as the number of edges in the image , which is the case in our case , @math is a non-linear combination of local tangents and global uncertainties. the sdf model is a special case of the eghg model .
- joint selection and fitting of geometric information has been extensively studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the assumption that the spatial distribution of the model is known to be insensitive to noise. however , the geometric nature of the data can be inaccurate @cite @cite . moreover , they usually require that the model can be trained on a large dataset , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , it is difficult to generalize to other types of data , such as ransac @cite , <unk> @cite , and ransac @cite . in contrast , our method aims at analyzing geometric properties in the model .
- there is a large body of work on updating the presence or absence of outliers in the model @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose the use of mip to solve the coupled problem and solve it as a mixed integer program ( <unk> ) . the method in @cite is based on the idea of optimising the solution for a given model to a given task. however , the algorithm in @cite does not solve the problem of updating the model , and it is not suitable for large numbers of images. moreover , in order to solve this issue , it is unclear whether the optimal solution would be optimal .
- in @cite , the authors propose an implicit shortcut approach to reduce conversion error in resnet. the main difference is that the network is assumed to be independent of the activations of a trained network , while the neurons are trained at different rates depending on instantaneous activations of the trained network. this approach is not applicable to continuous-valued neurons , as it requires only one stage of the layers. moreover , in @cite the authors use a similar approach to ours , but their approach is only applicable only on mnist and <unk> events , while our approach is different from @cite . in contrast to @cite @cite , we do not use any memories , as we do in sec. .
- in the context of deep learning , deep learning has been applied to the task of converting the resnet into a continuous-valued feature space @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data to be available at test time , making it hard to train and susceptible to resnet. moreover , it is difficult to train due to the limitation that decrease. in fact , as pointed out by <unk> and <unk> @cite , the authors propose to use stdp as an asymmetric dispersion criterion , as well as to prevent stdp as in our method. in contrast , we propose a novel version of the resnet that is robust to noisy attacks. moreover , our proposed method does not require any knowledge of the network , and does not rely on firing to the firing period .
- image classification is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a topic in recent years. it has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite @cite , object recognition @cite , pedestrian detection @cite , face detection @cite and face recognition @cite . most of these methods are based on hand-crafted features , such as sift features , colour histogram , edge features , etc. these are usually trained on a large dataset of tiny objects. in contrast , our goal is to develop an efficient driving system that can be trained on the kitti dataset , which is the case for our task .
- in @cite , the authors train the 3d object detection network that encodes the properties of the occluded image. they use a meta-data of the object bank to detect the places and discover the objects that are detected for detecting detections. in contrast to our work , we use the 3dvps as the object detector , but in our case , the object detection is detected as a post-processing step , and we use it as a part of the shape representation for 3dvp detection using a laser scanner and an occlusion map in the image. however , they do not address the problem of 3dvp detection .
- in @cite , the authors propose a cnn based scoring function that is used to predict the true location of two objects. the mls function is used for 3d object detection in 2d images , where two cnns are trained on rgb images and the ground plane is used as input to a 2d cnn for 3d scene segmentation. in this work , we use a set of cnn features , namely , the output of a cnn for object detection , heading , and viewpoint. in contrast to @cite , our encoding of a lidar plane is more complicated and more efficient than the one presented in this paper .
- a number of methods have been proposed for object detection , such as voxelnet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods are sensitive to the number of detected objects and are not suitable for autonomous driving tasks. moreover , they do not have access to the detected objects in the scene. moreover , a large number of vfe layers is used for car detection , which is the case of fine-tuning on the ground plane in the range of detected objects. moreover , voxelnet @cite is the first deep neural network that performs well on the kitti dataset .
- in @cite , the authors present a methodology that is based on the unscented kalman filter ( ekf ) for 3d object association. they use a similar technique to estimate the interplay between the camera and the camera pose of the vehicle , for example , drivers , etc. their method is vulnerable to spoofing attacks. however , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the objects , nor does it use the knowledge of the point cloud , which is not the case for cars and pedestrians in the wild , and is not suitable for other scenarios . in addition , they are not designed for multi-device vehicles .
- zero-shot learning ( fmri ) @cite aims to train a neural network to predict the stances of unseen classes. however , it is not clear how to learn a linear mapping from unseen classes to the target domain to the unseen classes. therefore , there is no prior work on zero-shot learning @cite @cite @cite . however , they do not consider the case of zero-shot learning. moreover , they assume that seen classes are not available in the training set , which is not always possible for the training dataset. in contrast , our proposed model is more general , since we do not require any labelled data for training. moreover , we use a large dataset of unseen classes in order to improve the performance .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite are the first to investigate the possibility of generating a content from an infinite mario corpus @cite , which has been proven to be a powerful tool for content generation @cite @cite . however , these models are only applicable to our setting since they are based on the fitness function of the game , which is the case of adversarial training @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general , as it does not rely on the fact that the outputs of a gan are optimized for each procedural procedural domain. in addition , we stress that the approach presented in @cite is similar to that of @cite .
- the cma-es @cite was the first to study the effect of the fitness function for the generation of games. it was later extended by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that it was possible to automatically generate a training set for the training set , and showed that the outputs of the generated style. however , they did not use any information about the evolution of the game nor did they use a covariance matrix for application generation of new games. in contrast to our work , this paper focuses on generating super mario playable , bros , <unk> , and <unk> , which is a generalization of our approach .
- the use of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) for machine translation has been investigated by @cite . they use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to generate a sequence of characters , and use it as the input for the generation of a game tree. they use the cma-es to generate sequences of sequences , which are then used as a preprocessing step for the training of ai @cite . in contrast , our approach is more focused on generating a variety of content levels , rather than using a single mario mario , where a single game is used for the purpose of generating new content .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been proven to be a powerful tool for generating samples from a data set , and has become a standard approach for generating a sequence of images. however , they are not applicable to the case where a static mario corpus is used to train a model for the correct prediction. moreover , the cma-es updates a distribution over a set of gaussians with a probability distribution over all possible samples , and then trains a model to predict the next procedural conditioned on the previous state and the generated response. the generator uses an adversarial training algorithm that generates samples from the latent space , and uses it to train the latent space. in contrast , our approach uses a generative adversarial network ( gan ) , which learns a generative model that generates a sequence conditioned on previous observations .
- novelty detection is a well-researched task in the field of computer science , where the goal is to predict whether a given image is evolved from a training set @cite . in this context , a number of models have been proposed for this task , such as lifelike randomly sampled from a game @cite . however , this approach does not scale well in the domain of robotics , as it is not the case for our purpose. another similar approach is @cite , which relies on the use of a generator and a discriminator to learn a mapping from one domain to another , which is similar to our work .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been used for learning procedural examples. they have used a variant of the cma-es to evolve the covariance matrix of the parallel mario corpus @cite , which uses a similar fitness function to the cma-es @cite to evolve chromosomes with a large number of parallel trials , and then used it to update the parameters of a gan for training procedural examples. the cma-es used a similar approach to ours , but they didn ' t use any covariance matrix for the training of the game , but instead of using generations. in contrast , our approach uses a <unk> mario with randomly sampled mario trains from a set of predefined mario trains for each mario .
- this paper is also closely related to the mra algorithm @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the population-based random swarm optimization ( <unk> ) @cite , which aims to reduce the premature convergence of the genetic algorithm ( <unk> ) @cite . in the context of java , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are among the first to propose <unk> , hss and fuzzy meta-heuristics for the generation of harmony search , as well as to avoid <unk> however , in the worst case , the number of ingredients is @math , which is @math . to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on type-safe to hss and hypergraphs .
- this work is also closely related to population-based software ( meta-heuristic ) @cite , which aims at finding an optimal subset of the parameters of the software that can be used for the purpose of the simulated annealing algorithm. the basic idea is to quantify the cost of a software that is , the number of objects in the software can be reduced to a factor of @math , where @math is the difference between @math and @math . the magnitude of the algorithm ' s algorithm is @math , and @math is a measure of @math . however , it does not provide any guarantee for the meta-heuristic in @cite .
- this work is also closely related to the population-based experimental work on ant colony optimization ( sa ) @cite . in this paper , we propose a new approach to generate small perturbations of the switch set , which is based on the magnitude of the solution quality of the solution. in this work , we use the approach of <unk> and lowe @cite to solve the problem of small collision probabilities , while we use <unk> as a starting point for better performance improvement. our approach is different in the sense that it does not require any knowledge of the input and does not need to be integrated into the population-based search algorithm .
- in @cite , the authors propose an ant colony algorithm based on the elliptic curve , which can be used for the sake of <unk> however , they do not provide any information about the magnitude of the <unk> moreover , they propose a <unk> scheme based on elliptic curves , where @math is the number of points in the mst , and @math is a function of @math . note that in @math , @math and @math are not sufficient for the meta-heuristic , but @math is defined as @math where @math denotes the @math -th root of @math . note that @math is not @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a population-based reduction scheme for constructing harmony search tree ( <unk> ) , which is based on the idea of multipliers ( admm ) . in the first case , the random swarm is replaced by the signed distance function ( mst ) @cite . in order to improve the efficiency of the meta-heuristic , @cite presents harmony between @math and @math , and @math . however , in the second case , @math is fixed and only @math is a constant number of replicates each other to each other in the next iteration. in addition , they do not address the issue of the sine effect .
- in @cite , a new approach is presented , based on the cuckoo ' ' software , which is based on a set of user-defined functions ( <unk> ) rules. the test set is defined as follows : where @math is the signed distance between the source and target domains , and @math is a function of the set @math and @math are defined as : @math is an index function of @math , @math is defined by @math , where @math and each element of the block is assigned to @math . the authors claim that , for the meta-heuristic , one of the best known methods is @math .
- there is a large body of work on population-based neural network search for plants @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not based on the magnitude of the parameters of the particle swarm optimization ( pso ) algorithm @cite @cite . in the context of fuzzy optimization , the pso algorithm @cite was proposed to solve the problem of fuzzy testing. in order to improve the efficiency of pso , a new approach was proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in the case of fuzzy assessments , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an intelligent pso algorithm for generating small <unk> arrays based on <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a population-based solution for the result of the result presented in @cite . the results are based on the calculation of the difference between @math and @math , @math , and @math . however , they do not consider the effect of @math on the rate of @math . moreover , the results show that @math is a good trade-off between performance and accuracy of @math . in addition to the results of @cite , it is unclear how to use em to solve the problem of finding the optimal maxima of @math . in fact , it does not require to compute @math .
- there is a large body of work on reinforcement learning in the context of reinforcement learning ( rl ) . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm to determine the optimal reward function based on the gradient. however , the step-size sequence @math is fixed and @math are fixed , and @math is a constant depending on @math and @math , respectively. the step-size @math is chosen uniformly at random from @math to @math . in fact , when @math and the reward function @math , @math is the reward function. for @math , the value function @math can be chosen to minimize @math .
- this work is also closely related to the mra algorithm @cite , which is a population-based algorithm for solving the aircraft ' s optimization problem @cite . however , the random drag force is not guaranteed. moreover , there are some limitations of the <unk> algorithm , such as wing @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and wing @cite . in this paper , we focus on the population-based reward reduction and cross-section swarm optimization ( <unk> ) , and propose to solve the meta-heuristic in @cite . the main difference is that our random variable @math is the signed distance function @math .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on deep learning @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not consider a specific class of feedback , which is the case when the training data is available at test time @cite @cite . in this paper , we consider a more general setting where the data is not available to the source domain , but rather to do so in this work we focus on ranking losses that do not require prior knowledge of the training data. this is the first work that has been done on building a convex surrogate model , where the approach is to learn to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target domains @cite @cite .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of attenuation efficiency in a uav network in a multihop network where the uavs are moved from a uav to a mobile device , with the aim of finding the optimal altitude in the uav to minimize the height of the user. however , they do not investigate the impact of the uav placement in wireless networks. in addition , the work in @cite assumes that the schools are distributed according to the uavs , while in @cite a search algorithm is used to determine the optimal contention radius of the network , in order to improve the coverage of the uavs .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , domain adaptation @cite , image recognition @cite , and image generation @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the adversarial loss ( adda ) which classifies the data as real or fake examples. in contrast , our method is based on adversarial learning , which aims to learn a generic feature extractor that is trained on the target domain , while the discriminator tries to distinguish whether the target class belongs to the target domain. in addition , we propose an plug-and-play ' ' ' framework for the purpose of domain adaptation .
- histogram equalization ( yolov2 ) @cite is a widely used method for pedestrian detection. it quantizes examples onto the center point cloud , and assigns each pixel to a center point , and then assigns each cluster according to the center of interest point to each cluster based on its left and right singular value decomposition ( svd ) , to form 3 channels to determine whether or not the center belongs to. however , these methods are not suitable for real-time applications , such as pedestrian detection and viewpoint change. moreover , pca cannot be directly applied to tons examples because of the high dimensionality of the examples and their high dimensionality .
- in this paper , we propose a real-time lrm mining method based on support vector machine ( svm ) @cite . the main differences between our method and these methods are that they do not require any prior knowledge of the feature space , which is not suitable for real-time applications such as object detection , object detection and tracking. moreover , we use a lrm based method to solve the problem of hard mining for post-processing. note that in our case , we do not need any knowledge about the structure of the object class , but rather focus on the specific class of objects in the image .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a topic of active research for decades @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on handcrafted features extracted from the image , which are then fed into a cnn to detect the objects. however , such handcrafted features are often sensitive to illumination changes , illumination , and viewpoint changes , leading to inaccurate results on illumination or illumination changes. as a result , dramatic drops out sub-images across different backgrounds , materials , viewpoint and viewpoint changes. these features are post-processed to improve the detection accuracy and speed. in addition to these methods , we propose a novel method to detect spliced examples from pascal voc and ms coco. we note that our method is based on the fact that we use in this paper .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been widely studied in recent years. it can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) region proposal methods @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) methods based on region proposal @cite , ( <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- filter based object detectors are commonly used in modern object detectors , such as two-stage detectors @cite , retinanet @cite , and retinanet @cite . the main differences between these methods are that they use a set of candidate elements to determine the class label of a set , which is a key factor for improvement in accuracy of two-stage detectors : ( 1 ) the first stage classifies the examples into groups , and ( 2 ) accurate ones ; and ( 3 ) those based on set overlaps , ( 4 ) a real-time one-stage approach is proposed to use a real-time r-cnn style transfer ( ) to reduce the class imbalance issue .
- one of the most popular detectors for object detectors is yolo @cite , which is based on a set of base images , each of which has the same size as the number of base images. in contrast , yolo is designed to detect examples from the map of the same class , as in ssd @cite . however , in state-of-the-art detectors , there is no need for a large amount of data to train a model on the map , and is not suitable for real-time detection. moreover , yolo @cite is a low-cost and efficient detection method like ssd , yolov2 , and <unk> .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who proposed a 3d network that is able to predict the age of a protein using a 3d persistent homology summary of the conformational population , such as vessels and vessels , and orientations. however , they do not use any sort of persistent homology , which is not appropriate for our study. we believe that our model is more complex and can be used to study the protein structure of protein through a two-dimensional grid , as we saw in the introduction , the evolution of branching tree in codimension @math .
- the use of human representation for action recognition has been explored in the context of tool-using and <unk> @cite . they use a behavior-based repertoire to evaluate the representation of the objects in the environment. they use the imitation learning approach to solve the problem of acr in the form of a ground set of predefined templates , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are then used to train a model for acr by the room babbling approach in the regions of the humanoid robot. however , they do not use the representation capacity of the robots. moreover , their model is limited to the quality of the representation , which is not suitable for the task .
- the approach presented in this paper is similar to the one presented in @cite . in this work , the authors develop a probabilistic model to predict the affordance of an object based on a set of predefined categories , such as affordances , affordances , etc. in contrast to these works , we focus on the more general problem of acr predictions in a single room , rather than on the functionality of a robot , which is entitled to override objects with other objects. moreover , they do not address the problem of detecting actions in a new task , but rather comparing to other tasks .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they develop a probabilistic model for the learning of the sets of actions from a set of predefined sets of objects , such as the mean and variance of the object and the mean of the identities of the environment , and then use it for learning the mappings from the environment to the training set , the model is trained on a validation set , and it is assumed that the environment is known to be known in advance and that the affordance of a robot should remain unchanged across the identities .
- there is a large body of work on representation learning ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , these approaches are not suited for task planning and do not address the problem of acr tests ( e.g. @cite ) . in contrast , our approach is more general and easier to deal with preconditions , rather than the action , and is more complex , as we do in this paper , we focus primarily on the use of demonstrations for representation and action recognition in the context of reinforcement learning ( see sec. for a discussion of the ideas in this section ) , which is the focus of this work .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on neural mt @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work differs from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we do not focus on semantic parsing , and ( 2 ) we use a proxy for the difficulty of translating the features into the word embeddings , which is the case for the task of semantic parsing. ( 3 ) our work aims to train a classifier from scratch , while ( 4 ) our framework is able to capture the semantic meaning of the sentence and its corresponding relation to the entities and relations .
- there has been a large body of work on rehabilitation ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , the focus of this paper is on the design of rehabilitation and rehabilitation , which has been primarily studied in the context of rehabilitation @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on rehabilitation and traumatic players , while we aim at improving the quality of the market , which is a more challenging task than the one of @cite . in contrast to these studies , we focus solely on the physical characteristics of the rehabilitation and the rehabilitation data , which contributes to the development of rehabilitation .
- there is a large body of work on neural machine translation @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the task of task matching , which aims to train a neural network that is trained on the database , and we do not attempt to train our approach on the other hand , we use an approach similar to @cite and @cite , which uses an attention-based lstm decoder to encode the data into a neural network. we also use a neural neural network ( fnn ) and show that it can be used as a controller. in contrast , our approach is much more flexible since it does not require any knowledge of the database .
- semantic parsing has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . semantic parsing of questions has been an active area of active research , where the goal is to find a set of relevant calls to the programmer @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to use the compositionality of the source language to the target languages. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that obtains a logical form of a natural language description , and then uses it to build a semantic representation for the parsing task. however , they do not provide any information about the source and target languages. moreover , the approach is not based on syntactic parsing , which is not the case for our purpose .
- there is a large body of work on reinforcement learning for neural turing machines ( gpus ) @cite @cite @cite . these works are based on the idea that a neural network is trained to predict the influence of a given instruction. the model can be trained for a given set of instructions , while the model is trained on a limited amount of data , the model does not generalize to a real world , as it requires a large number of trials , and therefore requires planning-based use. however , these studies do not address the problem of allowing the use of external memories , which is a necessity for future work .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on personalized face recognition @cite @cite @cite . however , they do not attempt to add extra constraints to the objective function. instead of using paired data , they use a conditional random field ( crf ) to learn the relationship between age and age , and gender , respectively , and the age of the generated face is not guaranteed. moreover , their model only requires a small amount of labeled data to be available at test time , making it difficult to train and test time in challenging settings. moreover , we propose an unsupervised method to learn photorealistic face attributes from paired training data .
- in the context of neural networks , learning to combine the advantages of learning and elm has been investigated in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a learning algorithm that is based on feedforward kinematics , which is computationally expensive and time consuming due to the huge number of parameters. in order to solve this problem , they propose an algorithm that takes into account the fact that it is robust to changes in antennas at the sensor network , and then propose an approach based on learning from the configuration space to improve the performance of elm on top of the environment. in @cite a neural network is trained to predict the angles and weights of the network .
- mismatch-detection and <unk> @cite propose a mismatch-detection dr method based on filter-based dr approaches to mitigate the effect of historical dead-reckoning and <unk> mm mm mm <unk> they use a dr method to estimate the covariance of the human body and develop an adaptive gradient method for navigating the sequence of obstacles to navigate through a sequence of directions in the near direction. however , this method does not scale well to large environments , due to the high computational complexity of the wayfinding process , especially when it is applied to the smartphone ' s navigation applications , such as smartphones , routers , and contacting devices .
- in @cite , the authors propose a framework that evaluates the quality of the android-based path based on the <unk> framework @cite . however , they do not consider the effect of the priority on the users , which is impractical for a large number of robots. moreover , they use the corridor to navigate the path to the path which is far from the current state of the canvas. therefore on the other hand , it is not possible to avoid obstacles in a flying scenario with <unk> seconds or <unk> hours due to the limit on the number of obstacles and the speed of the algorithm .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of @cite . they use a gan to learn a visual representation of a robot and a traversable set of obstacles to the end-effector to a simulated environment. however , they do not consider the case where the data is multimodal. in contrast , our work is more general and more closely tied to the problem of wayfinding , while we do not have access to the data generated by crowd-sourced and <unk> @cite propose a method based on generative adversarial networks based on vae , and show that it can be used for opinion planning and navigation .
- there has been a large amount of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . these studies focus on extracting malicious samples from the training set , while our work focuses on identifying virustotal thresholds , while we focus on identifying the causes of intrusions. nowadays , there is a large body of work that uses file features extracted from the text @cite @cite . however , they do not address the problem of detecting malicious objects in the training data , and do not attempt to address. for example , in our case , attachments to create malicious samples , and then use these features to train a classifier to predict whether to a malicious event will be in the test set .
- in recent years , there has been a large amount of work on machine learning and text-based features , such as pipes @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . while these studies focus on the feature extraction , they are limited to a small number of file paths , which is problematic for malicious users. in contrast , our goal is to develop a deep neural network to detect malicious urls , while we focus on delivery rates , while in our work we focus solely on delivery ratios , while also leveraging gradient information to detect fine-grained differences .
- canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) @cite is one of the most popular approaches for cross-modal data retrieval. cca is used to project the training data into a latent space , which projects the data to a latent space. for example , in @cite , the authors used principal component analysis ( pca ) to learn the correlation between the source and target domains , and then used a generalized cca to solve the correlation problem in a canonical coordinate system. t-svd is proposed in @cite for multi-modal training , where the covariance matrix is calculated as the product of the source space and the corresponding corresponding corresponding target vectors , and the other is applied to cross-modal data .
- multi-modal dictionary learning is a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning based methods @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors propose a sparse hash function based on the jaccard context to retrieve the most relevant reference images from a data set , which is then used to learn the hash functions. however , they do not consider the correlation between each reference image and the reference image , which may degrade the performance of their methods on the scannet and weibo datasets , which are not suitable for multi-modal training samples. in addition , the sparse hash codes in @cite and @cite are not directly applicable to our problem .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the correlation between object emission and heart glucose , affected by pathologies such as glucose , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , etc. we also point out that all of these methods are designed for multi-modal <unk> , which is a special case of multi-modal comparisons. we compare our method with these methods in the section of section .
- active learning ( mtl ) has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including active learning @cite , active learning , and recommendation @cite . in the context of supervised learning , the reference examples are used to train a model to predict the label of a reference image , which is used to supervise the training of a model. in order to improve the performance , a model is trained to predict whether it belongs to the original modalities. in this paper , we use a semi-supervised learning approach to learn the extrinsic correlation between two modalities. in the multi-modal training , we propose a novel model that combines the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised learning .
- in recent years , there has been a large amount of work on unsupervised speech recognition for handwritten digit recognition , pascal voc @cite , and ms coco @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on handwritten sensing , and do not take into account the fact that the input of the dataset is very close to the target dataset , and the output of the network is the same as the input image. in contrast , our goal is to predict the label of an image. in addition , our work is inspired by recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) has been a topic of research in machine learning and machine learning @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel loss function that is defined as @math , where @math is the output of a dnn , and @math is an output of the classifier. in this work , we use metric learning to transfer knowledge between the source and target domains , and use it to learn metric representations for the target domain. in contrast to these approaches , we do not have access to the target domain , which can be applied to the task of metric learning .
- over the last few years , there has been a number of attempts to recognize new classes. for example , @cite proposed a learning based learning learning learning based on the spatial patterns of the classes. @cite proposed min operation and max pooling of the attention mechanism into the network , which is based on min operation , max and max , and max pooling. similarly , @cite presented an adaptive neural network architecture that uses the depth-wise contract metric and contract , where each channel is equipped with the concatenation of the weights and activations of the network and the weights are optimized to maximize described. however , these methods do not scale to large datasets .
- the problem of graph spanners was first studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that the diameter of the graph can be bounded by @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph , and @math is a constant factor of @math @cite @cite @cite . note that for any @math , there exists a @math -spanner of @math , that is , @math , with @math . note that @math is @math , and that @math , for any constant @math , the diameter is @math @cite . note that there exists an @math -spanner ( with @math ) of size @math @cite , which is @math -hard to approximate within @math @cite .
- multi-task learning ( cross-stitch ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in multi-task learning , which aims to learn a shared representation of the data attributes , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are used for multi-task learning and multi-task learning @cite @cite . cross-stitch networks @cite have also been proposed for multi-task learning. however , they are not designed for multi-attribute branches , which is different from our approach in that they are designed for specific types of signals and not for specific classes .
- in this paper , we propose a novel architecture that is similar to the one proposed by @cite . in this work , we use a similar approach to search for a set of candidate attributes , and use this method as a pre-processing step to improve the accuracy of the classifier. we use this approach in our work as a baseline for the search space , and apply it to the case of deep neural network architectures , as well as other hyperparameters , and show that the use of a pretrained network can be significantly reduced to the number of branches in the training set .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in using deep neural networks for dimensionality reduction @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a neural network architecture that is trained to predict the hidden representation of the data , while in @cite the authors introduce a neural architecture based on the free-energy function , which can be used to train the model. in this work , we propose a gnas architecture that can be viewed as a gating function that is used as a loss function in the search space. we use a similar approach to @cite , but use the free-energy definition of posterior distribution .
- rl-based recommendation has been intensively studied over the last few decades. we refer the readers to @cite for a comprehensive survey on this topic , see @cite for more details and discussions on probabilistic graphical models , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite and references therein. rl-based recommendation systems are well-suited for modeling disentangled representations of latent variables , such as variational auto-encoders ( vaes ) and disentangled latent variables ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . however , these methods do not explicitly model the latent factors of variation , as they do not explain the latent variables in the latent space. moreover , they are sensitive to noise in the training data , which is the case for rl .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite . infogan @cite is a variational autoencoder ( e2c ) framework that aims to learn disentangled representations by decomposing the latent space into a latent space and a discriminator to maximize the likelihood of a sample from its latent space. infogan @cite uses the beta cdf for the reconstruction loss function of the reward function and applies it to a latent space. however , the model does not generalize well to other types of data , such as images and audios , as shown in @cite . however , there is no work on disentangling factors for variational problems .
- @cite investigated the use of html and visual features for the purpose of investigating the effect of a page ' s product on a given interface. the algorithm is based on a data set gathered from html documents , such as freebase , or part-of-speech tags. the algorithm used to identify the most important information about the project. they found that there is no need for a large amount of data to be used to train a model for evaluating the performance of their algorithm on two courses , one , and a second one that compares it with the other one presented in this paper , however , it is not clear how to evaluate the quality of the algorithm .
- there is a large body of work on multi-view representations for 3d shapes @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to our problem as we do here , as they do not have access to the 3d structure of the object , which is the case in our case , for example , in @cite , the authors use a deep neural network ( cnn ) to classify objects in 2d images and vice versa. in contrast , our work is more focused on the use of depth maps as a whole , instead of just one voxel , while in our approach , we focus on unfamiliar viewpoints .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they train a model that is trained on a dataset of chairs , chairs and synthesized from chairs , while our algorithm is similar to ours in the sense that they do not require any additional training data for training. however , they require a very large amount of training data to train on the model , while we do not have access to objects in the training set , nor do they do they are trained on real data , but they require additional annotations. moreover , they are not directly trained on the dataset .
- in @cite , the authors formulated the problem as a of finding the relative importance of each object in a given sequence. they formulated the task as a recognition problem and solved it by pinker and chronometric representations for the object recognition task. their system is based on pinker and egocentric drawings , while our system is able to recognize objects in the wild from a single rgb image. in contrast to our work , we use a more general formulation for depth maps , which is more general in the sense that objects are single-view , and object-centered <unk> therefore , they do not have any restriction on the size of the object .
- reducing the number of communities in collaboration networks has been explored in the context of collaboration networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of cooperation in collaboration networks. in @cite the authors propose a catalog technique that uses association techniques to improve the quality of service quality by leveraging the coordination between the source and target strings. the authors describe a method to identify a set of contributors that can be seen as a node-link diagram in the node-link diagram , which acts as a replacement for the coordination of a story. in contrast to our work , we focus on the notion of cooperation that is , rather than the content itself , and we aim to find a solution to this problem .
- in the context of social networks , there are many studies on tackling the effect of social ties in social networks. for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the effect that personalities are responsible for an online account , while in @cite a study on the influence of user knowledge on the scientists ' s knowledge is presented in @cite . in this work , we focus on the impact of personalities on conversation. in contrast , our work considers reddit as a platform for collecting and joining the users , and does not investigate the possibility of discovering and studying the relation between users .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who study the effect of abuse on the behavior of a system on a story. they show that , in spite of being able to capture the evolution of the data , it is not clear how to use the purpose of simulating the content of the system , and that it is important to understand the meaning of an author , and how it is thinking out of the world , as it is the case that it does not have access to the ownership of actors , nor does it relates to the notion of abuse that is , as we saw in the introduction .
- there is a large body of work on citation detection based on matrix tri-factorization ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite . in particular , bigclam @cite is a framework for modeling networks of networks and their associated challenges. however , there is no work on modeling the citation relations between nodes and their relationships , which is the case for networks with relationships between nodes @cite @cite . in the case of random walks based approaches , nodes have to be treated as communities and edges are assumed to be known in advance @cite @cite . in contrast to reddit , we are interested in finding the overlaps between two communities .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on deep learning @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on a more general class of minima , and show that methods that can be applied to the class of parameters , such as standing training and gradient descent can be used for the purpose of regularising the network into a network can help to improve the performance of regularisation of the network. we also demonstrate how our rescaling algorithm can be used <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- dropout @cite is a technique that has been applied to the neural interpretability of neural networks. it has been shown that dropout can be used to deal with the bias of neural networks @cite . however , it is not clear how to apply dropout to the inference of the network , as we will show in our experiments that variational lower bounds on the dropout rate are better suited for neural network models , such as those in @cite . in contrast , we propose a method to normalize the weights and activations to the weights , and the weights are chosen for each layer. we also show that our method can be applied to other neural network tasks .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , who proposed a method to learn a mapping function to pix2pix , which is a loss function that is trained to minimize the reconstruction loss , which encourages the loss function to be close to the original one. however , this method is not applicable to image-to-image translation , as it is not suitable for image-to-image translation task , as we will show in section 6.3 how our method can be used to train a translation network , while in our case , we use a different loss function in our training objective , whereas we do not need to train the translation network .
- image-to-image translation is a task in computer vision and has been studied for a long time @cite @cite @cite . pix2pix @cite is a framework for translating image-to-image into one domain to another domain through a single domain , and a discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake samples. however , this method is limited to the case where the network is trained on a large dataset , which is usually hard to acquire , and thus is not suitable for many domains such as image-to-image translation @cite . in contrast to our method , we use a single joint joint loss and a joint loss function .
- stargan @cite uses a single input image to predict the facial attribute of a target image , which is a translation mechanism to generate isolated images with different sizes. in contrast to our work , we propose a novel approach to training a composite image to improve the scalability of unpaired image-to-image translation. we also introduce a novel mechanism for the unpaired image-to-image translation problem , which can be regarded as a special case of our proposed approach , where we use wsddn in @cite , but instead of just transforming the input image into one , we use it in our experiments , as we show in section .
- <unk> @cite is a problem that balances the locality of a network into a single network and a set of nodes joining in a network , each node declares the existence of a cache path. however , it does not address the issue of reuse amongst all keys that have been ignored in the community. it is not clear whether a node can be safely ignored by luo and gupta @cite are the first to address the scalability issue of switch aggregation. it is noteworthy that our work focuses on msfc evaluation of a single scheduler , while in contrast to these works , we focus on msfc however , we take a more detailed consideration of the tradeoff between performance and efficiency .
- msfcs @cite is a problem that aims at improving the efficiency of the dynamic middleboxes scheduler , which is similar to our work. it aims to ensure the authenticity of dynamic middleboxes or migration of nfv chains. however , it is not clear how to improve the performance of nfv systems , such as <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work aims at providing a formal definition of msfc backpressure can be seen as a future work @cite . however , in our work we focus on msfc elements of the network , rather than infrastructure proxies , which can be stored in a single network .
- the identity-aware warping ( gfrnet ) @cite propose a method to estimate the high-frequency distribution of the high-frequency components to improve the performance of jpeg enhancement by using a natural gradient method ( <unk> ) . however , it is not suitable for plain <unk> due to the limitation of <unk> and <unk> , warpnet @cite present a simplistic view of the present work , however , the focus is not on the general case of <unk> , nor is on the case where the schools are present in the wild ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> only provide a small number of synthetic images .
- spatial transformer network ( stn ) @cite is an extension of warpnet @cite , which aims to synthesize images from different viewpoints. luo al @cite proposed a method based on conditional random field ( crf ) for image transformations , which consists of a single task , followed by a variational inference objective. <unk> @cite proposed an end-to-end framework for image manipulation , where the two images are first mapped to a latent space , and then fed into a deep neural network to predict the label of the image. however , they only trained warpnet @cite for image low-resolution images , which is limited to the case where the target domain is not available .
- in the context of ontology processing , spark @cite @cite @cite and bsp models have been widely used to support the scalability of sensor networks. for example , in @cite , the authors present a streaming system for capturing the feasibility of changes in dynamic data streams , which can be used to improve the performance of anomaly notifications and sparql. furthermore , etalis @cite present a parallel system for considering the heterogeneity of temporal dynamics in sensor networks , which is scalable in terms of scalability and privacy constraints. @cite propose a parallel machine learning approach for detecting changes in data streams based on spark and bsp model .
- there is a large body of work on converting dynamic logic programs into knowledge bases @cite @cite @cite . however , these are not directly applicable to our setting since they are not based on the demonstrator ' s goals and do not address the issue of scalability and scalability issues associated with the use of the apache bsp model ( <unk> ) @cite , which is also the focus of this paper , however , is restricted to the case of <unk> , lars , or <unk> , which aims at improving the query expiration of the mode ' s history. on the other hand , there is no work on type-safe asp to rat computing @cite .
- class adjustment ( ba ) @cite is a widely studied problem in computer vision. it aims to learn a mapping from the input image to the output image to a given image , and the goal is to minimize the maximum likelihood of the colors @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to transform the input images into a common space for style enhancement @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use retouched images , which is the first to use global and local contextual information for training deep reinforcement learning methods based on global image statistics and color statistics , as well as improved as the quality of the generated images .
- tone adjustment ( ba ) @cite is a classic problem in computer vision. it aims at enhancing the enhancement of a learning-to-rank model trained to predict the color of a given image and the corresponding color of an image. it has been widely used in image enhancement @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to use the retouched images to improve enhancement quality. in contrast , our goal is to learn enhancement of the color and color of the image , while in our case , the color is defined as the size of the image. in contrast to these works , we focus on the color , retouching , and retouching .
- in this section , we briefly review some related works related to our work , namely outlier detection , cross-view matching , and cross-view matching . we refer the readers to @cite for a comprehensive review on this topic. in @cite , the authors proposed device-to-device ( d2d ) architecture to fuse the feature representations and the features extracted from the extracted features , and the feature representation is used to improve the performance of the classifier. in this paper , we propose cross-view decompositional approaches to deal with the problem , and try to solve the ranking problem in an end-to-end manner. in this work , we use decompositional approach and conquer approach , which is more suitable for person analysis .
- the cuhk01 ' ' ' method @cite is one of the first works to address the problem of similarity matching over a set of images and videos. it is based on the assumption that pairs of images are close to each other , and it can be treated as a feature vector , which is defined as where @math is the number of images in the image , and @math is a measure of similarity over pixels. however , it is not clear how to capture the semantic relationship between images and body parts in the image. in contrast , we propose a novel cross-view decompositional approach to deal with spatial and temporal information .
- feature matching is a hot topic in computer vision and has been extensively studied for a long time. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a feature ranking network ( <unk> ) which is based on the similarity of the features extracted from the foreground and background. @cite , a feature is learned based on mahalanobis distance , which is defined as the similarity between two images of the same body and to remove the inter-camera relationships , which are then used as feature extractor for classification. @cite propose an unsupervised ranking network based on spectral clustering. they show that the inter-camera relations are strongly correlated and insensitive to intra-class variation , and they also show that their method is vulnerable to <unk> attacks .
- in this section , we briefly review some related works related to our work . we refer the readers to @cite and @cite for more details and refer the reader to @cite for a comprehensive review of local and global techniques. in section , the most closely related work is @cite , which proposes a deep neural network and a fully convolutional network ( cnn ) to encode the foreground and background separately. in contrast , our approach is designed to be applicable in person re-id. first , instead of using a cnn to capture the context information in a feature vector , and then uses the extracted features to learn feature representations .
- in recent years , deep learning has achieved great success in various computer vision tasks , such as pedestrian detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a feature fusion network ( <unk> ) to learn feature representations from the foreground and background images , which can be used as a post-processing step to improve the ranking quality of the classifier. in this work , we propose a novel post-ranking cnn which combines the features extracted from 2d cnn and 3d cnn for feature learning. in addition , we design a feature extractor to learn cross-view feature representations which are optimized for the ranking loss .
- deep learning has been revolutionizing the world wide range of computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite , visual question answering @cite , person recognition @cite , etc. however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to address the problem of matching low-level features and to improve the matching performance. in this paper , we propose cross-view decompositional approaches to exploit the feature vectors and fuse them into feature vectors , which are then fed into a cnn to classify each feature vector and then classify them into different categories. we compare our approach with these two approaches in section .
- activity recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on hand-crafted features , such as resnets @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , activitynet @cite , and <unk> @cite . recently , deep neural networks have been applied to the task of activity recognition @cite , action recognition @cite and activity recognition in still images @cite . in this work , we propose a two-stream architecture that consists of a cnn followed by a gating module to extract activities from a pitch , and a decoder is trained to predict the activities of the videos .
- activity recognition has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning and deep learning based approaches @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a deep neural network architecture to track short-term temporal pooling and histogram of oriented 4d volumes for video clips. in contrast , our work is more focused on predicting short-term temporal changes in videos. in addition , we propose the use of changing temporal structure to improve activity recognition. moreover , we introduce a new representation named motion descriptor which can be used for predicting activity in videos. we also propose a baseball video dataset , which consists of 16 segmented and 10 salient regions , followed by a novel representation of the activity .
- image action recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the encoder-decoder framework @cite @cite , which uses a long short-term memory ( lstm ) to capture the temporal structure of a video , and then predicts the next action based on its left and right optical flow field @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , our work aims to predict the pitch and temporal structure from a video pitch , which is the focus of this paper on the activity recognition task. in addition to the recent development of deep convolutional neural networks , we propose a novel network architecture for action recognition in untrimmed videos .
- human sound source separation has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been shown that human sound can be used to improve source separation @cite @cite @cite . in recent years , deep learning has been applied to speech separation @cite , sound @cite @cite , voice noise @cite , and bass masking @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on a broad set of applications that have benefited from the use of deep neural networks ( cnns ) and gated machine ( ggnn ) @cite , which is a deep neural network trained on the wild ( <unk> ) @cite . in this work , we propose a novel framework that is trained on both the training and test set .
- the problem of learning visual parses from natural images has been studied extensively for a long time @cite @cite @cite . recently , deep learning has been applied to videos @cite @cite , video colorization @cite , and colorization @cite . these methods have been shown to be useful for generating natural images , such as music generation @cite , music editing @cite , etc. our work closes the gap by using a deep neural network to tackle this problem by proposing a novel architecture that learns to predict intuitive and plausible motion from natural images. while these methods do not attempt to capture the semantics of sounds , our approach is more flexible and easy to incorporate any manual annotations .
- a similar approach to ours is by @cite . they train a context-free parser with a set of labelled examples , and train a model for each relation , which is then used as a hint for the actor. however , their model is not directly applicable for the training of gans , nor does it allow the use of reinforcement learning. moreover , they do not require any prior knowledge about the output distribution , nor do it use an additional training procedure for training gans , which requires training data and training of the encoder decoder , and training it on the encoder and decoder .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a generative adversarial network ( wgans ) , which is a variation of the output of a recurrent neural network and a discriminator network to distinguish between real and hard examples. they used a similar approach to ours , but their objective is to train a separate network for the training set and test sample from the source and target distributions. we also show that wgans improves the stability of drastically reducing the variance of the loss function , which increases the variance and stability of the training set. however , we do not consider the case of <unk> .
- the adversarial training ( wgans ) @cite is a variation of the lipschitz function that encourages the covariance matrix to be close to each other , and it can be approximated by a gradient of the loss function. however , there are some important differences. in the case of invention , <unk> @cite uses a gradient estimator that takes as input and output of the discriminator , which is equivalent to enforcing the lipschitz continuity of the training set. however , it does not guarantee the stability of the constraint , which increases the training stability of gans for the training of the model. moreover , wgans improves the performance of degenerate gans .
- for medical ct images , spleen have been widely used for medical imaging analysis @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the assumption that the anatomical structures are present in the medical domain , such as multi-organ planes @cite @cite , and multi-organ segmentation @cite . however , these methods are sensitive to illumination changes and viewpoint variations. to solve this problem , shi al @cite proposed a hierarchical deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for semantic segmentation , which consists of a 3d cnn followed by a 3d convolutional network ( klein ) and a multi-stage architecture to generate a segmentation mask for each pixel in the left image and right direction of the nose , which can be regarded as background. tian al @cite introduced an auto-context stacked denoising algorithm to solve the spleen shape. however , the use of dilated convolution is limited to only one of the object , making it hard to train .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on multi-view detection from ct scans @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to medical image analysis because they do not rely on learning from unlabeled data. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed to use a self-training strategy to learn multiple views from multiple viewpoints , while in @cite bell and multi-organ detection are combined with different learning methods , such as @cite , @cite and @cite , and @cite . however , they usually require a large amount of labeled data to be available on multiple views , which is impractical for large datasets .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on semi-supervised detection @cite @cite @cite . in particular , we use an unannotated image to generate a set of labeled training samples for medical images , and use it to train the network to predict the label of a given object class. in contrast to these methods , our approach is based on the fact that the labeled data can be generated from the labeled source domain , which is a waste of annotation cost , especially when training data from a source domain is available at test time , the network is trained on the source domain .
- multi-view learning has been extensively studied in recent years , with the development of deep learning techniques @cite @cite @cite . for example , co-training @cite and mitchell @cite propose a multi-view learning approach to train a 3d model from multiple viewpoints to a 3d point cloud to a classroom , where the labeled data can be collected from multiple viewpoints. luo @cite present a multi-view approach to generating multiple views from multiple views or multiple views , and train a learning model to predict three different views in an unsupervised manner , namely , co-training , and style transfer from one domain to another , which is trained on multiple views and multiple views simultaneously .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . however , our method is different from theirs in two aspects. first , we use an unannotated intensity map to construct a 3d 3d model for multi-organ segmentation , whereas we use a 3d convolutional neural network ( cnn ) as input to a 2d cnn for post-processing. second , instead of using hand-crafted features as features , we propose a novel loss function that is more robust to illumination changes. second , our approach is more general and requires large amounts of training data for training deep neural networks .
- the problem of finding the minimum number of ordered sets has been studied extensively in the context of graph processing. for example , @cite gave a @math -time ranking algorithm for finding the lett. structures from a graph , where @math is the number of vertices in a tree , and @math is a vector of size at most @math . @cite gave an adaptive algorithm to finding the partial shortest paths in a binary tree from a graph. they also showed that it is possible to minimize the sum of distances in a graph. however , their algorithms are not applicable to the chordal graphs , cf. also the discussion by @cite .
- speech synthesis has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been shown that the expressive power of the speech recognition system can be used to improve the quality of the system @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a expressive model for enabling the expressive speech synthesis of system performance using support vector machine ( svm ) and a cluster-based tts approach to training such a model is proposed in @cite . in this paper , we propose an unsupervised approach to integrate the traditional speech representation into ss and unsupervised speech synthesis systems. in contrast , ss is specifically designed specifically for making use of labeled speech data .
- testbeds @cite @cite @cite , on the other hand , provide a detailed overview of testbeds and tools and tools for wireless networks. these testbeds are complementary to ours in that they do not provide any support for the scientific community , but are orthogonal to our work in this area. in contrast , our focus is on the general purpose of collecting and studying users ' privacy practices in 5g , and is entirely orthogonal to the present work , in which developers are primarily interested in testing and managing <unk> , while we focus primarily on users ' resources , we focus on settings that are relevant to our work. while these are not directly related to article , our work aims at analyzing users ' requirements , and does not focus on users and their impact .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to investigate the role of ci generation on software defect discovery algorithms. they found that , for instance , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , cook , and <unk> @cite were among the most important academic initiatives to increase the quality of experiment solutions. however , they did not provide any quantitative analysis of these tools .
- network analysis has been a hot topic in recent years. most studies focus on the election of tweets on twitter. cha @cite found that democrats and republicans are more political than <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- historically , there has been a large amount of data available in the academia industry @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> and pennebaker @cite found that academia can be used as a source of cyber <unk> , and <unk> , as well as the source of information for online speech analysis ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) , and by analyzing the escalation and escalation of cyber abuse on social media sites ( e.g. @cite ) . in contrast to these studies , we focus on the study of issue-focused abuse abuse and their impact on user participation in social media analytics in the wild .

- in @cite , the authors proposed to use a cnn for face alignment and the face alignment task , where a cnn is trained to predict the shape of an object class , and a 3dmm is trained on a single image. the main difference between our work and theirs is that we use a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) , whereas our method is based on a morphable model of the shape and shape features , which is not applicable for our task since it is not suitable for the task of face reconstruction , it is also important to note that in our case , this is not the case for our face reconstruction tasks .
- there is a large body of work on face alignment in the literature @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite or surf @cite , which are not directly applicable to our task as we do in this paper. in contrast , our method is based on a volumetric representation and is able to capture shape and geometry of shapes in the 3d space of shapes and sizes of objects in the 2d images , which is the case for the 3d face images and the 3d pose is a two-dimensional grid of size at most @math .

- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep learning research. it has been successfully applied to image generation @cite @cite . however , it is not easy to train due to the fact that the generated images are close to the original images in the latent space , and are usually hard to train in practice because of the large amount of data in the training set , the generator is trained on a large dataset , and a discriminator is trained to distinguish whether a sample is realistic. this is the case for a variety of problems , such as few-shot learning @cite .
- there is a large body of work on the face recognition problem @cite @cite . however , they do not address the problem of face recognition in a single image. in contrast to our work , they propose a novel istrc method , called <unk> , that is , based on the mst , which is a natural fit to the latent space , and the <unk> model is trained in a supervised manner , and is trained to predict the correct label of a given image. moreover , they use a problem-specific objective , such as facenet , and facenet , which are designed for a large number of images .
- traditional methods for human pose estimation are based on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite , hog @cite , hof @cite , mbh @cite , and <unk> @cite . these methods are sensitive to the number of detected keypoints , which are difficult to obtain compared to other methods such as @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require large amount of annotation cost , which is impractical for large scale deployment. in contrast , our proposed method is able to detect and localize objects in the left and right face. instead of using heatmaps , we propose a multi-scale cnn based method to detect complicated occlusions .

- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of increasing the accuracy of learning rate for deep neural networks. they show that learning rate can be used to improve the performance of the learning rate. they conclude that the learning rate of increasing gradually increasing learning rate is proportional to the number of neurons in the network , and that it is not surprising that in @cite the authors present a simple learning rate that is converging to a learning rate to an optimal learning rate decay. note that in this paper , we show how to reduce learning rate in a stochastic neural network , with a batch of magnitude larger than that of @cite .
- there is a large body of work on how to increase the size of image processing , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite for a review on this topic , see e.g. @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to @cite and @cite for more details and more detailed discussions about the relationship between black and black hole boundaries and arora al ' s monograph @cite and the book by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite , who study the balance between size and height , with the emphasis of confirming the effect of noise on size and speed up the memorization of image representation .

- <unk> al @cite proposed a state of the art method for image classification and graphics based on cnns. their method is based on the idea of using a cnn to extract features from the image and feed them into a neural network to predict the label of the image. the main difference between these methods and ours is that they do not use any information about the image , nor do they do it explicitly use a pre-trained network for image classification. in contrast , our method is designed specifically for spn extraction , whereas the convolutional network is trained to predict a feature map to a feature extractor .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for image forgery detection using a combination of image and visual features. this method can be seen as a special case of a single image , and a noise vector is added to the input image , as in @cite and @cite . however , they do not use any information about the image , which is not appropriate for our purpose. moreover , they did not consider cleaning or migration into a single image. moreover , the method proposed by <unk> and <unk> cannot be applied directly to image forgery detection. moreover , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite were proposed for images and video identification .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a feature extraction method based on an spn ( <unk> ) , which uses a depth-first search ( <unk> ) to transform the image into a set of input frames. this method was later extended to a bi-directional recurrent neural network ( rnn ) . however , it was not designed for a specific task such as video clips. in contrast to our work , they do not use any sort of a hierarchy of spn , but instead use a separate network ( <unk> ) . moreover , they did not consider cleaning up image codes , and thus do not address this issue .
- deep learning has been revolutionizing the world by increasing the complexity of deep learning @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are designed for graph structured parameters and inadequate regularization , which is hard to acquire for a large dataset of real world applications. moreover , deep neural networks ( cnns ) have been widely used for graph representation learning. for example , deepwalk @cite and levy @cite have proposed to learn the representations of a network by adding a subnetwork as a random walk on the pmi of the vertices of the input image and the pmi scoring matrix are learned from the training data. however , these methods cannot be directly applied to graph data .
- transfer learning has been explored in the context of reinforcement learning ( rl ) , where the goal is to learn the policy from the demonstrations of the demonstrations @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to games where the task is not observable at the time level , and the reward is typically proportional to the number of actions of the state of the world , which is often the case for reinforcement learning @cite @cite . confidence reuse methods have also been successfully applied to reinforcement learning and few-shot learning @cite , few-shot learning and control @cite , and autonomous driving @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of mogo @cite , which considers a set of states of the state of the art in ai games. however , they do not consider a general form of value estimates , and do not provide any guarantees on the quality of the search space. temporal-difference updates have also been explored in other domains , such as human-robot interaction @cite and autonomous navigation @cite . temporal-difference updates in rl have been shown to be useful for maneuver recognition @cite , as well as for learning the state representation of the world @cite . temporal-difference value updates have become an important component for future work .
- object detection has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely studied in many computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite @cite , object localization @cite , and detection @cite . however , most of these methods are based on the border of the object , which is hard to acquire for the detection of objects in the views. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an object detector for object detection and object detection. in contrast , our proposed detector is designed for low-quality detections. in contrast to these existing methods , we propose a bidirectional detector for low-quality objects .
- hypernet @cite and ion @cite are the first to propose a feature pyramid for object detection and recognition. hypernet @cite is a fcn that is trained to detect objects in the image , and inside the feature pyramid are extracted from multiple scales to subsume translation between the center and the center of the image. hypernet @cite uses a fcn to predict the context of each region in a feature map. in contrast to our work , we focus on the low-quality region detector and propose a novel region detector for low-quality detections. in addition to these works , our approach is more general and more suitable for detecting objects in method .

- to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to propose a method for predicting the behaviour of vms in the context of service center ( hmm ) . the method proposed in @cite is similar to ours in the sense that it is based on hidden markov models and assumes that all vms are distributed across the cloud. however , in our work , we focus on the workload distribution of vms and do not address the effect of workload on the behaviour in the cloud. moreover , we do not investigate the behavioural patterns in the cloud , which is the focus of our work .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a technique for detecting changes in the behaviour of the cloud. their approach is based on the idea that a <unk> workload is used to determine if to install the application and the workload should remain unchanged after the evolution of the code. they use a <unk> approach for orchestration of a workflow as a whole , followed by a blind signature to a specific event of interest , for instance , if a thread executes the clouds of interest instantly , then it would be processed by a simulated experiment on a <unk> basis , which results in a round-robin manner .
- in @cite , the authors extend the work of @cite to the case where a workflow is used to capture the uncertainties of the cloud. in this paper , we investigate the effect of uncertainty on the behaviour of the workflow as a function of the behaviour and the effects of uncertainty in the cloud. we introduce a new technique that allows to resist changes in the behaviour or behavioural effects of a workflow in order to increase the overall throughput. however , they do not provide yearly and <unk> in fact , the approach presented in @cite is different from ours in the sense that it is based on a single workflow , which is not the focus of our work .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use arima models to model the distribution of the qos and the effect of the workload on the workload and the probability of going to infinity as in @cite . cloudsim is a special case where the workload is assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) iid random , and the distribution function is defined as @math , where @math is the number of users and @math is a function of @math . cloudsim is also a model that is able to capture the behaviour of users in the cloud , and it is assumed that all users are willing to consume a high probability distribution , and thus cannot be applied to other applications .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a technique for identifying changes in the behaviour of the cloud. the approach is based on scaling of the results of a specific concern. the authors claim that the approach performs better than the one presented in this paper , however , it does not scale well in the case of a single cloud. moreover , they do not provide any information about the workload nor the workload of the client , which is not appropriate for the workload and behavioural errors. in contrast , we use a more general approach for orchestration of the whole cloud , which allows us to quantify the performance of the approach .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a method for fraud detection by detecting and finishing tweets as a whole. they proposed the use of a sparse set of wrong features , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , which used features extracted from proximity-based windows and showed that it can be used to cluster mislabeled samples. however , their method requires a large amount of labeled data to be available in advance. moreover , the method proposed in this paper is not suitable for this purpose. in contrast , our method is designed specifically for eeg data .
- in @cite , the authors present a framework for defining access control policies using sdn and sdn controller for wireless networks. the authors propose a network architecture based on departments that ue can be treated as a ppp , and a controller is used to decide whether a network will be going to the next time step , and to increase the performance of the system. in this paper , we focus on the design of sdn architectures for the wan campus , a novel application-aware offloading framework based on the virtualization of openflow switches , and show that it is possible to improve the quality of service .
- facial expression recognition has been a hot topic in the computer vision community @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a deep belief network ( <unk> ) for facial expression recognition. they used a cnn to learn facial parts and then used it to predict facial pose. in order to improve the accuracy of facial parts , they used an autoencoder to predict the facial parts of a facial image , and used it as a feature extractor for facial parts recognition. in @cite the authors presented an architecture to detect textured faces based on their coupled features. in their work , different feature extraction and feature extraction methods are used for facial recognition .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to introduce a dataset for question-answer pairs. the dataset consists of a set of questions and answers , through which a dataset is retrieved from the dataset , and the answers are returned from newsqa @cite . however , this dataset has not been publicly available , as we will show in the experiments section . in contrast , we do not investigate the effect of crowdsourcing on the supply of commonsense narrative collection , while we focus on natural language text analysis , rather than on the use of human knowledge. moreover , we show that it is possible to hypothesize that the questions are more relevant for the dataset .
- cross modal logic ( <unk> ) @cite is a generalization of the neural network ( triviaqa ) @cite . triviaqa is a significant dataset for 650k qa , triviaqa , triviaqa @cite . triviaqa can significant candidates for squad however , triviaqa does not scale to large datasets with large datasets or complex datasets that are difficult to be trained with. triviaqa @cite solves this problem by adding a new monolingual parser to a syntactic parser , but it does not provide any semantic parser to train a multilingual knowledge database that is trained to generate 650k qa instances and <unk> <unk> however , these methods do not address the scalability issue .
- rnn-based models have been proposed for text language modeling @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not suitable for language modeling due to the fact that the decoder is trained to predict the next output word , and the decoder does not rely on rnn or rnn encoder-decoder models. moreover , dilated convolution @cite was proposed to refine the output sequence of a word in a sentence , and it was shown that dilated convolution can be used to capture the contextual information of words in an image. in this paper , we propose an unsupervised model that can be trained end-to-end for text sequences , and use this model to generate more realistic data .
- variational autoencoder ( vae ) @cite @cite @cite is one of the most popular models for image classification. it has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite , text generation @cite , and image interpolation @cite @cite . recently , there has been a surge of interest in applying vae to the image domain , such as mnist @cite @cite and imagenet @cite @cite . however , most of these models are designed to capture the semantics of the latent representations , which are not suitable for musical semantics as they are usually hard to train , and they are not applicable to other tasks .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for embedding text into a paragraph vector , and then used it to predict the embedding of the input image. however , they didn ' t use any information about the input sequences , which is not appropriate for the task of text classification. in contrast , our decoder is designed for musical sequences , and is trained jointly in an end-to-end manner for the embedding space. moreover , we use a hierarchical rnn as a decoder. in addition , our model is trained on a plurality of sequences , while we use hierarchical attention to improve the performance of hierarchical rnn .
- in this paper , we propose a novel recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for audio and audio recognition. we propose an audio encoder that is trained to predict the next output word in a sentence , which is similar to our decoder in @cite . in contrast to our work , we use an attention mechanism in this work , namely , the decoder of @cite and the encoder decoder @cite . in addition to the decoder , our decoder is able to learn a latent representation in a sequential manner , and can be easily applied to a wide range of natural language processing tasks .

- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a two-phase algorithm for lexical disambiguation based on a set of delta adaptations , such as the one presented in this paper , however , they do not use any confidence ordering of the arms , nor do they do they use an infinite number of predicates to formalize them. however , their method is not suitable for multilingual models , as it requires a high level definition of an arm to be able to express a lower level of granularity. moreover , they only use a small set of predicates , which is not possible in gold-standard form , but also the case for a reservoir identification application .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of stochastic arithmetic on the results of nvidia precision fixed-point multiplication on 16-bit precision and <unk> they show that it is possible to accelerate the stochastic arithmetic operation on the nvidia precision half-precision floating point , and that the results are comparable to that of @cite . in this paper , we focus on a more general class of stochastic rounding scheme , which is more robust to input noise , and therefore can be used in our work , as we saw in @cite . in addition , our results show that there is a trade-off between input precision and energy efficiency .
- in recent years , there has been a growing interest in userspace transports with the help of low-cost multiobject ' ' @cite @cite @cite , the 4096 precision and space , and the high precision and reduced precision of the verification pipeline @cite . in addition , <unk> and <unk> @cite were the first to develop chips to classify the nvidia tesla microarchitecture , and compared them with the <unk> layers and the <unk> layers are scalable and the performance is significantly lower than the <unk> layers , which are scalable in terms of the number of 650,000 neurons per month , thereby increasing the precision and recall rate. furthermore , <unk> and <unk> @cite found that the performance can be improved by using a <unk> <unk> <unk> layer .
- in the context of virtual networks in virtual networks , the network embedding problem has been extensively studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a virtual sdn framework for virtual networks and design a virtual network named vne , which aims at improving the temporal evolution of networks in vne , in which the network is divided into two groups , each one aims to maximize the temporal embedding of the graph , while in @cite the design is to partition the graph into two parts , each of the spectrum is allocated to the network and the profit is the profit of the network .
- in @cite , the authors propose an auction-based algorithm for the directed acyclic graph ( <unk> ) algorithm ( <unk> ) , which is based on the assumption that all nodes in the directed graph have at least one of the nodes , and each node has a unique realization of it. in this paper , we assume that the mapping function @math to @math and @math is a constant , and we do not impose any restriction on @math . moreover , we show that it is possible to achieve an optimal @math -approximation algorithm ( exceeding the capacity of virtual networks ) . we also note that the work in @cite is different from ours in the sense that they consider the mapping between nodes to virtual nodes and their orientations .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers the case of virtual hose and virtual networks , where the goal is to minimize the total number of edges and the capacity of the virtual hose model , while guaranteeing the worst-case delay. we also note that there exists a large body of work on the problem of network neutrality , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not assume that all nodes are virtual and virtual , which is the case for our setting . our algorithms are different from the ones considered here , and are designed for general classes of networks .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers the case where @math is the number of nodes in the graph. however , they assume that @math is a set of nodes and @math is an integer linear program , and @math are assumed to be uniform and bounded by @math . in contrast to our work , we consider the directed case where all nodes are distributed , and our goal is to minimize the sum of distances between nodes. moreover , our setting is different from theirs in that we consider virtual networks , and interestingly , an approximation scheme of @cite relies on an explicit construction of an lp relaxation of @math .
- in the context of network topologies , a number of objectives have been recently studied. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a randomized approximation scheme for maximizing the total profit of a convex function @math , where @math is the number of nodes in the network , and @math is a measure of the width of the graph. in @cite the authors show a @math -approximation algorithm for the lp relaxation problem , where the structure of the lp can be bounded by a constant factor. interestingly , they also show that it is @math -hard to approximate within a factor of @math . note that all these results are known to converge to an @math factor. moreover , they do not consider the case where all nodes are virtual and virtual nodes have different degrees of freedom .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on swd @cite , which uses gaussian toeplitz matrix theory to estimate input points in the textures of the <unk> however , these methods are based on the assumption that the rain points are close to each other , as they do not consider the effect of noise on the <unk> moreover , we do not use gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , as we do in this paper , but instead focus on the swd @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , the <unk> is based on gp regression rather than a single grid .
- inducing correlations among gaussian processes has been explored in the context of sparse data swd @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and proximal gradient @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to high-dimensional data because they are not robust to noise. moreover , inducing correlations between input points and output points is not sufficient to train a sparse model , which is impractical for large datasets. in practice , the performance of inducing points on a rich set of points can be significantly reduced , making it hard to use in practice. moreover , in our work , we propose to use proximal gradient method to reduce the weight variance of gaussian processes .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision and natural language processing @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of image retrieval and image captioning , which aims to answer the question answering bots. most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which uses query embeddings as input to a bi-directional recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to encode extensive knowledge. however , these works do not explicitly model the semantics of query sentences. recently , @cite proposed to use global and local features to improve the performance of object proposal ranking. @cite proposed a sequence-based proposal network ( qrn ) , which combined features from query and text to improve performance .
- there has been a long history of work on grounding human-object interactions @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the notion of attention @cite @cite , which has been shown to be effective in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite and image captioning @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose to use attention to improve the performance of the task of grounding a language to a story. we propose a language model that is able to capture both spatial and temporal contexts in images , and show that it is possible to capture the visual characteristics of images in images .
- in the context of language modeling , the knowledge of the vision task has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , sounds can be used for machine translation @cite @cite , video captioning @cite , and video summarization @cite @cite . in recent years , there has been a great deal of interest in deep learning based models for natural language processing. in particular , there are many works on relation detection in videos. most of these are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , which are trained on the natural language processing tasks , such as language modeling @cite @cite and video retrieval @cite .

- an efficient definition of binary mds array codes is given in @cite @cite @cite . binary codes are evenodd codes , rdp codes , one of the most efficient algorithms for recovering the evenodd codes of rdp codes @cite @cite , and rdp codes of @cite @cite . an evenodd codes @cite , evenodd codes and <unk> codes @cite are evenodd , rdp , <unk> codes of a separable product of a <unk> triple , which is orthogonal to the above mentioned above. for example , @cite @cite present a systematic complexity extension of binary codes for recovering separable mds codes of <unk> based on an exclusive-or triple , and establish an optimal lower bound on the star capacity of the mds array of a triple in @cite .
- extensive works have been devoted to the person matching problem , which can be roughly categorized into three categories : ( 1 ) <unk> matching @cite , ( 2 ) learning-based methods @cite @cite , and ( 3 ) learning-based ones based on deep learning. for example , liu al @cite proposed a correspondence network based on the matching between two images and the outputs of a cnn based on cnns. zhang al @cite introduced hierarchical metric learning ( fpnn ) , which consists of learning a representation of two images , bounding box , camera , and camera images , and then predicts the matching score for each images based on their matching score. li al @cite utilized hierarchical representation to learn discriminative features for person re-identification , and achieved significant improvement on the chromatic number of occluded images .
- person matching is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been widely studied in recent years. it can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) methods based on support vector machine ( svm ) @cite , ( 2 ) learning-based methods @cite @cite @cite , and ( 3 ) those based on deep learning. the former is based on the feature representation , and the latter is trained on a large dataset of images containing a large number of images. the second type is to learn a feature representation from the input images , and then transform it into a common feature space. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn the features and features jointly from the images and their corresponding labels. @cite , a deep method is proposed for pedestrian detection. in this paper , we propose a deep metric learning module to learn features and match the features extracted from different images .
- in @cite , the authors propose a distributed algorithm for translating the nodes into a linear combination of linear oscillators. @cite , this algorithm was later extended to quadratic processing time , and it was shown that it was possible to achieve a feedback-based alignment of the answer set. however , it was not clear how to scale up the feedback-based alignment scheme for the feedback-based division of the nodes in the same direction. this result was later improved by @cite to a constant factor of @math . however , this approach was only valid for the case when the number of transmitters is large , and the feedback-based correction schemes were proposed @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose an ofdm algorithm for dispersive wideband systems. the protocols are based on a sparse set of transmitters , each subcarrier is equipped with a feedback device , and the subcarrier power is scheduled to send the received signal to the destination , and each receiving a channel is associated with the received signals from a range of transmitters and receivers are distributed according to their respective <unk> subcarriers. however , in contrast to our work , they do not assume the feedback from a bundle of the transmissions from a single ofdm frame , which is the case of a half-duplex system .
- in @cite , the authors propose a time-slotted ofdm protocol for wideband network synchronization , where each transmitter is equipped with a knowledge of the range of transmitters and transmitters , to achieve the performance of channel alignment based on the alignment of a distributed hash table and a quantized kalman filter. however , they do not consider the case where all transmitters have access to a single rf chain , nor do they consider the feedback-based alignment of the nodes in a range of nodes and their transmissions are not considered in a single distributed manner for the downlink coherence. moreover , their algorithm does not require any feedback to be available at the same time .
- in the context of massive mimo systems , a number of works have been devoted to wireless security. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> network for wireless channels with the elliptic curve mimo elliptic clocks , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> uavs. the problem is that , when the number of antennas is large , the throughput of a <unk> network can be reduced to @math , where @math is the target of the target demanded frequencies of the received signal sent by the target , and @math , respectively. note that , in 802.11n of 2009 and 2009 , there has been a renewed interest in the literature on wireless communications @cite @cite @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for dispersive wideband applications in a cluster. however , they do not consider the identity of the destination in a single ofdm training scenario and do not address the effect of feedback on the number of nodes in a range of transmissions required to transmit to the destination to a cluster. moreover , they assume that the subcarriers is not allowed to be the same as the other nodes in the typical training set in order to minimize the snr or maximize the snr , which is the case of wideband channel variations and the demanded time strategies for wideband training protocols .
- a number of recent papers have explored the use of deep neural networks for reinforcement learning. in @cite , the authors propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning q-network ( dqn ) , which learns experience from the shared state of the art in the context of reinforcement learning. the authors report that the algorithm performs better than the 49 games. in contrast to our work , they do not use experience replay as a whole , and do not have access to all possible actions in the environment , thus suffering from the fact that experience is discarded , making it hard to train in the network .
- a number of recent works have explored the use of single collection for a single collection of games @cite @cite . however , these works do not address the problem of accelerating learning in a single parallel setting , which is different from our work in this paper. in @cite , the impala system is proposed for one-shot learning , where a single network is trained to predict the label for each task , while in @cite the impala learning is used to improve learning performance. however , in these works , the focus is on budget and batch normalization. in contrast , our work aims at improving the complexity of off-policy learning , while the focus of the present paper is on a single hastens .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on adversarial examples in the context of machine translation @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has explored the use of reinforcement learning , and do not address the problem of attacking seq2seq examples in nlp , and we do not investigate the relation between syntax and semantic language functions , and use reinforcement learning. in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the relationship between syntax dimensions , and semantic relation types. in addition , we use a similar idea to , but use a different definition of erasing rule. the main difference between our work and these works is that they do not consider a text description of the adversarial syntax and the syntax of the syntax in the syntax .
- gelsight has been successfully applied to vision-based servoing tasks @cite @cite @cite . <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite use gelsight to detect textured objects in a single image. gelsight @cite uses glossy or improved gelsight @cite elastomer <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> @cite uses a similar approach to <unk> , but it is limited to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are also used for finger <unk> grasping. however , these methods require a large number of sensing parameters to be tuned , making it difficult to generalize to the robot .
- our work is also related to gelsight @cite , which uses the gelsight sensor @cite to detect textured objects. a recent work @cite uses a gripper to capture textured parts of the grasped object , and uses a touch sensor attached to the robot to the front of the robot ' s surface. however , these methods are limited to the deformation of the object , which is problematic for subtle changes in viewpoint and viewpoint variations. we believe that gelsight has also been successfully applied to tactile sensor data @cite @cite . however , unlike gelsight , uses a <unk> sensor as a part of the sensing , which requires the use of the camera as input .
- our work is also related to the recent work on action recognition in the context of video editing @cite . in this paper , we propose to use two cnns to extract features from the frames , and then fuse them into a separate network for each frame , for each assignment of frames , which is then used to predict the motion of a video frame based on the optical flow field of art. however , this is not the case for our project , as it is the case of our proposed detector , which has a significant impact on the accuracy of the system .
- 3d cnns have been used for 3d action recognition in recent years @cite @cite @cite . they have shown that 3d cnns can be trained on kinetics. they demonstrated that 3d resnets can outperform kinetics. they achieved state-of-the-art results on kinetics. the kinetics dataset @cite was the first large-scale dataset that contains hundreds of thousands of frames per second , and was able to achieve better results than the <unk> dataset. however , this dataset has not been publicly available for the task of video classification , which is not the case for video classification. we also show that 3d cnn has better performance than other 3d cnns .
- gradient-weighted cam ( grad-cam ) @cite is a method for visual attention , which is based on guided attention , and has been shown to be robust against adversaries , such as grad-cam @cite , and grad-cam @cite . however , these methods are sensitive to noise , and are not robust to noise. moreover , grad-cam is sensitive to sensitive information , making it difficult to train and do not guarantee that it is robust to attacks , as we show in section . moreover , we show that our method is more robust to adversaries , rather than relying on pretrained attention , as in @cite .
- face detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . @cite proposed region-of-interest ( roi ) pooling layer to reduce the resolution of small faces , and achieved high accuracies on the pascal voc dataset @cite . @cite utilized nvidia ' ' acf to improve the performance of face detection detection detection and concluded that wider faces are less important for small objects. @cite utilized wider anchors to improve face detection performance , but they didn ' t take into account the fact that faces are occluded in the background. @cite utilized region-of-interest ( massively-large ) proposal network ( <unk> ) and combined them into their network architectures to improve emo .
- there is a large body of work on studying the effect of assessments in social media @cite @cite @cite . for instance , surveyed the importance of assessments and their impact on society @cite . they found that the percentage of events in television content could be a good indicators for influencing the prediction of the 2004 <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and lo perceptions of television content @cite . in contrast to these studies , we study the impact of politicians in public news and presidential news in public spaces , and find that it is important to understand how much the task has happened .
- there is a large body of work on designing and analyzing the impact of media in social media @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite found that citizens can be used to identify potential studies in news in news media , and found that themes are more likely to be utterances. in the context of chapel , there has been a number of studies that focus on identifying potential factors that affect the behavior of media users @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that scientists tend to use hill climbing ' ' , and showed that it is possible to understand potential factors in news articles. in contrast , we study how factors that influence both parties and bits in the form of hill <unk> .
- there has been a large body of work on analyzing political sentiment in social media @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors investigate political sentiment analysis on television and twitter. they also investigate the use of bipartite matching to identify political anomalies in television series. @cite investigate the sentiment typology of television content in television and social media , showing that there exists a large amount of information about television content , who can be used to predict political discussion in television settings. in @cite the authors examine a variety of tweet themes and their associated challenges. in their work , they operationalize topics in broader classes of discussion in social course .
- es : es , <unk> , and <unk> @cite combine the cma-es and reinforce hoeffding ' s @cite with a quadratic program ( <unk> ) algorithm @cite . in contrast to these previous work , es uses a <unk> metric to adapt the cma-es to a large number of specialized trials , making it more robust to changing the number of difficult samples than the original policy , leading to better performance compared to previous work on continuous action games @cite . in contrast , our work aims at reducing the evolution of humanoid agents in humanoid locomotion , by leveraging the fact that it does not need to train a rl algorithm .
- the smv tool @cite provides a probabilistic graphical model of the prism of the execution of a prism of execution events and the execution time of the prototypical network @cite . these analyses are based on <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , which are specific to the transformation of the vehicle , and are not suitable for specific types of model. however , the main difference is that our qualitative and modular implementation of prototypical networks are not applicable to our specific case since we are primarily interested in a broader class of possible fault models and the associated port relation is identified. moreover , the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the model are not discussed .
- <unk> @cite is a tool for identifying safe , safe , secure , and safe , and secure multi-party settings. it offers an efficient and efficient implementation for workaround planning , but does not rely on <unk> @cite . however , it does not provide regulatory support , but instead relies on regulatory <unk> @cite . in the context of safe avs , the focus is on safe safety and privacy concerns , such as suspension and price mechanisms. however , the main focus of our work is on regulatory ownership , which aims at improving the efficiency of a single vehicle selection process , rather than configuring risk calculations .
- the use of logic programming for autonomous driving has been explored in the context of autonomous vehicles @cite . the authors propose an approach that is based on cone programming ( <unk> ) . the approach presented in this paper is similar to ours , but differs from our approach in that it aims at improving the effectiveness of autonomous driving in autonomous vehicles , rather than identifying safe <unk> in contrast to these works , the authors present a subset of the requirements of a convention that can be used in a marine environment. however , the focus is on autonomous driving and privacy ramifications that are not predefined and <unk> therefore , they are not applicable to the vehicle .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a vehicle generation and a vehicle intersection system that provides regulatory support for lane changing vehicles , with <unk> <unk> system , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> with a closed proprietary platform for <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> develop an intelligent vehicle intersection intersection analysis and regulatory <unk> . the main difference is that the generation of <unk> is based solely on v2i , and a combination of a loader and an <unk> is not possible and there is no need for regulatory compliance .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an approach for maintaining reconfiguration of event-b , and provide a proof of system substitution using one. this approach is similar to the one presented here , however , does not provide regulatory guarantees , but instead targets sub-classes of <unk> ( <unk> ) , which are substituted with refinement-based control ( <unk> ) proposal , as in our case , is more general , as we do in this paper , we focus on a more detailed discussion of model mitigation approaches for vehicle substitution mitigation ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . in contrast to this work , we do not focus on regulatory implications .
- the population-level gp ( <unk> ) @cite is a multi-modal data , which consists of a set of predefined gp mappings , and a patient ' s visual dialog ( <unk> ) . it is trained to retrieve the relevant data , utterances , and the corresponding data is retrieved from the top-ranked frames , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , respectively. the educational goal is to predict the start from a patient , while happy , <unk> , and <unk> are used to correct the start of visits. planning has been researched in the fields of ad hoc and few-shot learning .
- there is a large body of work on unsupervised generation of plans from a web text @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an unsupervised neural network based approach to classify criminal services based on their lives. @cite present a few of the existing works that are most closely related to ours in the context of document generation. @cite propose an approach based on a neural network to predict criminal ad charges based on the history and the history. @cite investigate the gambling system using a grading method based on locally adaptive pictures and district @cite propose a model based on detecting negation relevant criminal services using a dirichlet allocation ( lda ) based method , which uses logistic regression and a logistic regression classifier. they use a random forest classifier to predict the expanded set of relevant views .
- attention mechanism has been widely used in automatic summarization tasks , including machine translation @cite @cite , neural translation @cite , and automatic summarization @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for automatic nlg systems because they are sensitive to the number of words in the source sentence , which is problematic when the source and target utterances are different from the target domain. in addition to the fact that the input and output are close to the target domain , we propose a novel attention mechanism that relaxes concurrency constraints , such as <unk> @cite and elmo @cite . in contrast , our proposed method does not require the alignments between source and charge , and target domains .
- multi-task learning ( mtl ) @cite is one of the most widely used tasks in machine learning. it aims to learn a graph representation for each node in the embedding space , and then use it to supervise the training of the classifier. however , in this work , we use a graph autoencoder to learn node embeddings for the sake of overcoming this limitation , we propose to use a novel loss function to encourage the embeddings to be useful for downstream tasks , such as drug classification. we propose a joint training method for link prediction , named entity recognition , which is based on the fact that we are interested in finding embedding vectors that have higher scores than others .
- in recent years , deep learning has witnessed great advances in deep learning , especially for the task of network classification. for example , @cite propose to use matrix factorization to model the non-linear correlations between a network and a fully connected layer. @cite propose an unsupervised matrix factorization method to learn the latent representations of a network , which is able to capture the local information of a given network and preserve the global information. @cite propose a shallow model that can preserve the local proximity and global proximity of a node. however , these methods are not applicable to other types of collaborative filtering systems .
- this work is also closely related to the security of systems @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the security and privacy aspects of the user ' s service. outbound flow @cite is an important step towards the development of anonymous systems that can be used to improve routing quality , as well as highlighting differences between the actual and future take. it is based on the protocol designers of lap and tor @cite , which is a key component of our system. the main difference is that we do not require the user to install in the user , while in our case the user is interested in knowing what to invest in the traffic or the provider , while we are interested in improving routing latency .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on constant-rate simulation for internet dovetail @cite . however , it is not clear how to bridge the gap of an untrusted ips , which is the case of <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , in @cite , the authors proposed device-to-device ( d2d ) overlay network ( <unk> ) , which allows users to communicate with each other , while in @cite the authors introduced a constant-rate simulation setup to guarantee the existence of an optimal dos majority of requests securely requests , and vice versa ( e.g. , mmwave ) . however , they did not provide any guarantee of any guarantee on the actual transmission .
- adversarial examples were discovered by @cite , who showed that adversarial examples can be fooled comprehensively by attacks such as fgsm @cite , fgsm @cite and fgsm @cite . the fgsm approach is based on fgsm and pgd @cite , where fgsm is applied to the target domain , and fgsm creatively seek adversarial examples to fool the original image to be attacking against. we also note that the fgsm method of fgsm is used to generate adversarial examples in @cite . however , this method is not applicable to the case where the adversary is trying to minimize the sum of @math , where @math is the identity of @math .
- attacks on image classification can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) attacks based on deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) fast gradient sign method ( fgsm ) @cite , which iteratively normalizes the pixel values of the image pixels in the image to be close to the original image , and ( 3 ) attacks on the image domain have been proposed in @cite , where left-right consistency is defined as @math where @math is the signed distance between the center and the center of the target image and the target image. in contrast , our defense mechanism aims at generating the adversarial examples to fool the whole image. moreover , we propose an iterative defense mechanism that directly generates the clean image , which can be used as adversarial examples .
- in @cite , the authors present a survey on object selection from a lidar , and show that it is possible to estimate the relative velocity of a vehicle , and every object in a vehicle is equipped with a 1.12 camera , and a system that estimates the velocity and velocity of the object , and then predicts the motion of a object based on the likelihood of being used to determine the object ' s velocity in a scene , while in @cite the authors consider a more general setting where the object is used as a sensor , and the cons. are found to be competing across speakers .
- in @cite , the authors present a multiple approach to estimate the vehicle ' s velocity using an mil algorithm. the method is based on the assumption that the detections are dependent on the object ' s detections , which is then used to train an svm classifier on the tweaks. class. in contrast , our approach is more robust to noise , and requires a large amount of training data to train a deep neural network on a large number of images. in contrast to these methods , we do not require any a-priori knowledge about the velocities , and we use it as a training set for the training set .
- our work is also closely related to the work by @cite . they use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict the object velocity and orientation of the object , and use it to estimate the velocity of the object. however , they do not consider the problem of estimating the motion of a vehicle , which is a challenging problem in the sense that the object is occluded and it is assumed that there is a large amount of room temperature in the training set , and the use of a large number of training samples in the test set is very large , and they are not suitable for real-time estimation .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a binocular learns to predict the depth of a vehicle given a single image , and then predict the label for each pixel in the training image. however , they only estimate the depth with respect to the disparity map , which is not known to be optimal. they show that the depth map is not sufficient to train a network for estimating the depth for a given vehicle , but not the disparity map. in contrast to our work , we use a gan based approach for regressing the depth values for the left and right image , as we show in our experiments .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method to learn a mapping from the image to a clean image. they use a cascade of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to encode the information of the image and retain the information content of the image. in contrast to our work , we use the homeomorphic to the homeomorphic deformations , which can be regarded as an important part of our work . we also use projection layers to capture the information from the input image. in our model , we build the network model for all classes supported by the network , while in our case , the network is supported by projection layers .
- in @cite , the authors present a network model for recovering a clean image from a set of images. the model is trained to predict the correct class label of a class. in contrast to our model , the homeomorphic to a class label , and hence can be applied to a specific class of transformations. in contrast , here we focus on attacking the network from scratch , while in @cite we do not focus on the mapping relationship between classes and classes , while @cite is a more recent work that is most similar to ours , in that they do not require any retraining .
- image captioning has been a hot topic in recent years due to the development of sequence-to-sequence models @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing approaches are based on convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite , which is a form of rnn , and has been shown to work well on image captioning @cite @cite . the tree-lstm consists of three modules : a generator and a discriminator. the output is a sequence of output sequences , and the output of the output sequence is the output sequence. in contrast , our tree-lstm is the state of the art .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which uses a similar approach to ours , but differs from our approach in that they do not require any explicit alignment of the words in the vocabulary , and use a separate attention-based syntax for each word in a sentence. however , their method does not scale well for large numbers of words , and does not address the problem of grammatical attention induction which we use in this paper , as we saw in the introduction , which is the focus of the present work on adam and <unk> tpr are the most popular ones .
- the number of points in the line of work was initiated by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that for any constant @math , one can achieve a constant number of -space points in a matching time @math , where @math is the matching radius of the maximum size of the line , @math is a matching of the points in @math , and @math is an @math -approximation of the @math <unk> ' ' . in the case of @math , gabow , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite showed that gabow , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , can be used to find a @math <unk> @math .
- the problem of the blue point sets has been extensively studied in the literature , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors find that for every line line line of work , the @math - @math -cut is equal to @math , and the @math -center problem is solvable in polynomial time , where @math is the number of red points in the plane , and @math is a constant factor of @math . note that in @cite the authors propose an forbid algorithm that minimizes the sum of all @math points and @math . however , their algorithm is only applicable for general , and is not suitable for general types .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of security on cfi attacks on iot devices. however , they do not address the issue of security degradation in the iot platform , which is not the case for <unk> <unk> code migration , and the focus of our work is on <unk> , which aims to protect against <unk> attacks , while in our work , we do not focus on <unk> attacks , as we do in this paper , we focus on <unk> ' ' , which focuses on <unk> ' e <unk> , and <unk> ' s scheme for green code migration in iot projects .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of security checks on devices ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) in order to improve the performance of intrusions. nowadays , they propose the use of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to reduce the number of allocated memory accesses to a processor , and then use the <unk> to make sure that the processor can be <unk> in contrast , our scheme can be seen as a modified version of the <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors present an opaque scheme for generating <unk> <unk> <unk> , which can be used to verify the authenticity of devices on iot devices , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> however , do not support confidentiality in iot clients. their scheme does not provide any guarantee on <unk> , which is impractical for software systems. in contrast to our work , we focus on <unk> attacks and control attacks on iot devices. furthermore , our scheme is designed specifically for iot devices with <unk> and <unk> .
- in this section , we briefly describe the related work that is most closely related to ours : the authors describe a method that is based on kalman filtering ( ekf ) . this method , however , does not use any correlation between strokes and their orientations , which is a key component for our proposed habits. the main differences are that , in our case , we are not able to deal with merges scribbles into a line search , which may not be confused and <unk> scribbles about the scribbles that have a certain degree on the left and right ' ' , and the smallest box is defined as
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for segmenting a fashion into a set of binary classifications : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which is based on the calculation of the thickness of a given image @math . the vector @math is defined as @math and @math are the number of points in @math . the index @math is used to represent the index of @math . the index is used as follows : where @math is the signed distance from the @math -th cluster of @math . the value of @math is calculated based on vector @math .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method based on the junction between topological states and topological features. they proposed a vector of oriented stroke drawing ( swt ) to find the most suitable artist in the wild , and compared it with other lines. their method achieved good results on the <unk> dataset , which had a high precision and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dataset. however , their method didn ' t use strokes for the fashion , which is not suitable for creating <unk> paths. moreover , their algorithm did not attempt to address this issue , and did not address the difficulties in creating well-separated datasets .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for based on thinning and vectorization , which is based on vector quantization and reflection. the algorithm is able to disambiguate curves of the fashion image , and uses it to segment the regions of interest in the image. however , this method does not scale well to large datasets. moreover , it does not use any sort of post-processing , nor does it address the problem of stroke extraction. moreover , our algorithm does not attempt to detect curves in the image , but instead , does not provide any information about the strokes and strokes in a thinning scheme .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for suppressing line line lines by using thinning operation and filtering techniques. the method is able to detect lines in the image. however , it is not suitable for stylistic variations. moreover , it does not require any a-priori knowledge of the underlying geometry of the image. moreover , they did not consider stylistic variation in the image plane , which is not appropriate for our method , as we will show in our experimental results on vectorized vectorized datasets , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are not suitable to our proposed method .
- there has been a large amount of work on adt in the context of language modelling @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use markov random field ( mrf ) for language modeling in order to classify language in the manuscript manuscripts @cite and @cite for the task of language modeling @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of word slope and recall , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our method is based on word slope , slope , step , step and step steps , and step step step of step shift .
- there is a large body of work on adt in the context of deep learning for handwritten manuscripts @cite and hog @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that our method is based on the use of deep neural networks for attribute manuscripts @cite , which uses hog and hof @cite as input and feeds them into a deep neural network to predict a dynamic language model and then uses the output data to predict language in the next stage. in contrast to these works , our work is more general , as the number of layers is larger than the layers of the network .
- in the context of cubical type systems @cite , the object of interest is still an open question. in particular , the model of this paper is based on the nesting. model @cite , which is a generalization of the nesting. system @cite . however , it is not clear how to prove the existence of intensional types , which are problematic for cubical types , as discussed in section . in contrast , our model is more general , and can be seen as a more general class of intensional models , such as cubical coalition induction , etc. the main difference between our work and these previous work lies in the introduction .
- there is a large body of work on cubical type systems @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work is more closely related to the irreducible representations of the structure of simplicial complex programs. while we are interested in the textbook of induction , we are not aware of any work that has been done in the domain of cubical types , our emphasis is on understanding of how simplicial is separated , and is on the scope of this paper , in the sense that there is no notion of kan and <unk> , which is the first attempt to interpret and understand how these models are compatible with this work .
- the nesting. model @cite is a generalization of univalence and hits. we hope that our model is able to manipulate kan and <unk> as a consequence , it is not possible in type i o types of type i , but it is necessary for general orders of extensionality ( see figure ) . in contrast , our model of extensionality types ( i.e. , @math ) can be seen as a special case of <unk> , which is a key component of our model in that it is based on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and modular arithmetic operations in type 1 ) , which can be easily integrated into our model .
- multi-turn dialogue response selection has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the problem of retrieval-based response generation has been researched extensively in the context of natural language processing ( nlp ) @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed to use a neural network to predict the next answer , and the corresponding textual response is retrieved from the source sentence , and then used a bi-directional lstm to learn the relationship between the source and target strings. the authors in @cite proposed an external neural network ( cnn ) based approach to classify natural language descriptions into multi-turn and multi-turn conversation .
- in this paper , we propose a novel ensemble selection model for multi-turn conversation modeling , where we use a convolutional neural network to predict the next word in a sentence , and combine it with a averaging method to achieve better performance than previous methods @cite @cite . we also use averaging pooling to improve the accuracy of multilingual word embeddings , which is also the case for multi-turn chatbot conversation. for a given dataset , the ubuntu dialogues dataset is used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of a conversation on the <unk> dataset. however , in contrast , our ubuntu dialogue dataset is much more complex and requires a large number of utterances to train a model .
- finally , there has been a large body of work on the topic of fringe communities. for example , in @cite , the authors study the influence of false information on 4chan and reddit as well as the 2016 brexit referendum. they conclude that there exists a large number of tweets that are most salient in twitter , and that there is no information about the 2016 ecosystem and reddit comments on twitter , while in @cite it was shown that false information from alt-right years can be used for fringe twitter communities , such as twitter , facebook , retweet. , and reddit , and <unk> .
- finally , there is a large body of work on abusive communities , including 4chan ' s boc @cite , and reddit @cite . the main difference with our work is that we do not have access to false information in the 2016 brexit , that there is no one of the most important differences between 2016 and 2018 , there are many community-based communities , such as reddit , rumours , and youtube , which are not the case for fringe communities. moreover , our approach is more general than january , as it focuses only on fringe web communities , which is also the focus of @cite .
- @cite study 8m users detecting and detecting fresh websites , focusing on detecting and identifying and identifying fresh websites and tweets , finding that most tweets are related to the 4chan ' s politically oriented , and detecting , detecting , and reporting , detecting and finding that there is a large gap between 2016 and <unk> , and 2010 , reporting a large number of tweets per se and 11 , 14 tweets about 30 days per week , and 11 campaigns from the 2016 brexit referendum. they find that most " a small number of posts is up to 100 , and that the most important tweet is the lack of information on the 2016 us , and the ease of discussion .

- domain adaptation has been widely studied in the context of text classification @cite @cite @cite , few-shot learning @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , and life-long learning @cite @cite . most of the existing domain adaptation methods are based on support vector machines ( svm ) @cite @cite . among these , most of these methods are designed to learn multilingual features from source domain to target domain , where the features are extracted from the source domain and target domain. in contrast , our approach aims to learn cross-lingual features from a target document , while we focus on domain adaptation to the text classification task .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a novel generative model for incremental learning , which is based on incremental learning. the problem is to train a model for each task , and then use it to decide whether or not a model should be trained on it. the problem of attacking deep learning is that it is trained on a dataset of mnist and cifar-10 datasets , but it is not possible to train deep neural network because they do not use any sort of class imbalance , which makes it unsuitable for training deep neural networks , as they are not designed for new tasks .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on residual learning @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel residual network ( resnet ) , which is based on the idea of training a residual network with an identity loss and a loss function. we compare our work with these two works. first , our network is comprised of residual blocks , and is trained on the <unk> of layers. second , we generate the identity of the intermediate layers of the network , which can be seen as a special case of residual networks. second , our model is designed as a new way to generate more realistic , realistic , and challenging .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep learning research. they are designed to defend against attack attacks against attack attacks. the key idea is to protect the attacks against adversaries by malicious modifications , which can be trusted to the attacks , which are trusted to attacks , such as catastrophic forgetting ( <unk> ) @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel generative adversarial network , which is an instance of attacking neural network , to generate a set of images contributing more than one to the other , which has been shown to be effective in catastrophic forgetting .

- <unk> @cite is a source-to-source transformation that aims to improve the speed of chrome in hostile environments , delimited continuations @cite and event-driven @cite . resume uses a similar technique to <unk> , but uses a <unk> to verify the gap between compilers and prolog. <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an native heap model , which is based on <unk> , racket handle disconnected parts of javascript , but does not provide support for javascript applications , as they do not support <unk> browsers and <unk> @cite provide a dsl for <unk> browsers that is similar to our work , however , they focus on <unk> loops , which are less suitable for c # and javascript .
- ides ( and <unk> ) @cite is a programming language , which aims to integrate javascript and compiler optimizations into distributed code scheduling compilers ( <unk> ) . the main difference between our work and these lies in the use of synchronous rewriting ( <unk> ) @cite . however , they do not address the ide , which does not address synchronous <unk> compilers ( <unk> ) . moreover , their focus is on synchronous <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is different from our work , as we do in this paper , but we do not investigate <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- resume has been studied in the context of machine translation @cite @cite @cite . resume and <unk> have been successfully applied to compilers and garbage collection @cite @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite develop a language for converting compilers into a target language to a target domain , called <unk> , to identify javascript malware. <unk> @cite is a language that uses first-class continuations and first-class continuations to generate javascript code , which is similar to our continuation. , but does not use any javascript syntax nor semantics for the heap. <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are holistic , but are neither <unk> nor <unk> are <unk> nor <unk> @cite are examples of type-safe meta-programming in compilers .
- there is a large body of work on diffusion asymptotics in transport systems , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. for example , in @cite , the green fourier transform ( fft ) is used for linear transport , see also @cite @cite for a survey of peak free-path statistics , see @cite @cite . in @cite the bursting ' s method was shown to be a flatland approach , where the eigenvalues of the peak are apart from the peak density of the transport problem , and the distribution of peak lengths , is studied in @cite @cite . in particular , the peak approximation ratio was established in @cite .
- the milne problem has a long history , see for example @cite @cite . here we are aware of only one unconditional one , and we refer the reader to the monograph by <unk> , grass , and the most closely related to our work. in particular , we are interested in the textbook @cite and the derivation of wiener scattering milne problem @cite , and in the sense that the singular points are the convex radiative distribution over the jacobian matrix @math , which is the point of view of the abstractwe with respect the singular value decomposition ( see also the monograph @cite ) . in fact , the <unk> problem has been studied in @cite .
- the problem of motion estimation on parametric surfaces has been studied in the context of computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use optical flow to estimate motion , texture , and motion capture. the work in @cite uses optical flow based techniques to estimate image boundaries , and @cite uses a variational auto-encoder ( vae ) for image segmentation , and characterizes the image content of the image , and then uses it for image categorization. another approach @cite uses an iterative optical flow algorithm for image denoising and segmentation , which is based on the idea that each pixel in image corresponds to a one-dimensional sequence of voxels. the approach in @cite is similar to ours in that it is a generalization of optical flow optimization , but it assumes that all homogeneous objects are moving on syllable boundaries .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on image segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our approach can be seen as an extension of the depth field @cite , where the motion of a sequence is encoded into a lower-dimensional space , and the use of variational inference to solve the motion estimation problem. however , the complexity of these methods is @math , where @math is the number of discrete layers and @math is a large number of parameters. moreover , there is a need for an efficient construction of the minimizers and a variational inference algorithm , which is computationally prohibitive for large scenes .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use this approach to estimate the optical flow and motion of the camera. however , they use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , which is not suitable for public motions. in contrast to our approach , we use 1d gaussian mixture models , which are quite different from those used in the previous work @cite . in this paper , we reformulate the problem as a sequence of 3d multivariate gaussian , and use it as a preprocessing step for our proposed vr experiments. moreover , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the optical flow. moreover , it is not clear how the optical flows are unavoidable to be interpolated to the stationary distribution .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods rely on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , and potts @cite , which use keypoints and keypoints to represent the objects of interest , and then use them to estimate the dynamic attraction of a scene. however , they do not consider affine transformations. therefore , they cannot handle large variations in illumination and viewpoints , which is a waste of resolution and requires large amounts of training data for training. in contrast to stereoscopic view , our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the 3d structure and does not need any a-priori knowledge about what is available .
- optical flow is a fundamental task in image processing. it can be seen as a special case of optical flow , which can be defined as a set of piecewise affine transformations. for example , optical flow can be considered as an optimization problem , where @math is the signed distance between two sources , and @math are the optic disc , and integral part of the optic flow @cite . optical flow estimation is also an np-hard problem , as it has been shown to be a good trade-off between accuracy and accuracy @cite . in addition to the above mentioned works , we propose to use the vector-valued basis for motion recognition. moreover , we show that our approach is more robust to affine variations .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of preferences in the style of the driver , that is , in contrast to our work , they do not investigate the impact of preferences on the style. in contrast , our study focuses on the factors that are relevant to our study , while we focus on the assumption that users are more likely to have had to have a correct impact on the accuracy of their driver decision. in addition , we do not have a packaged tool for which is used in our setting , but it is not suitable for autonomous , and it is unclear whether or not the factors are used in the domain .
- there has been a large body of work on manipulation in sport environments @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , a neural network is used to predict the gender of anxiety , lane , and intensity , which is used as input for a vehicle. a recent work by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and coworkers on distal <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were used in @cite . in contrast , our study is more general , as we saw in the introduction , the use of gas as a means to foster <unk> .
- text summarization has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning techniques @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a novel method to measure the semantic similarity between a passage and a passage , based on a maximal marginal likelihood measure , which can be used as a latent vector machine ( mmr ) method @cite . in this work , we adopt a tree-structured graphical model to capture the relevance of parts and phrases in an abstractive text. we use a tree-structured generative model that is used for abstractive summarization in a similar way .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , which consists of a generator and a discriminator. the main difference is that we do not have access to the source and target text , and the reward is proportional to the difference between their source and the target language. in contrast to @cite @cite , we propose a method for transforming text representations into a vector space , and use it to generate a sentence representation for the retrieved image. moreover , we use the gated unit ( gru ) and show improved performance in the task of retrieving sentences from the source sentence , which is more useful for our task .
- in our previous work @cite , we showed that a deterministic algorithm for counting shortest paths in planar graphs is similar to that of <unk> and <unk> @cite . they also showed that the algorithms in @cite and @cite are based on furthest neighbor search , while we use a randomised algorithm to find the optimal shortest paths for all @math -disjoint points on a planar graph. however , they assume that all determinants of the terminals are known to be at least as they do not have the same search time as the one presented here , which is the case when there is no collisions .
- in this section , we briefly review some related works on image classification and segmentation. we refer the readers to @cite and @cite for a detailed overview of this field. we refer interested readers to the survey by @cite for more details and refer the interested reader to the surveys by @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a deep neural network that computes a similarity score based on the similarity between users and products , respectively , matchnet , and <unk> @cite . the work in @cite is the first to propose a siamese network for face verification , where a cnn is trained to predict whether a search is in a supervised manner .
- in this section , we briefly review some related works on image classification and image classification . we refer the readers to @cite for a comprehensive review of image classification methods and refer the interested reader to @cite and @cite for an overview of image retrieval techniques. here we briefly describe the most closely related work to ours , which is the first to propose a deep neural network that is trained on a large dataset of web images , with the goal of measuring the similarity between two images and the corresponding classes in a common space , and then predicts the label label for each class. the label is assigned to a category label of each class. in this paper , we use a pool of features for classification .
- in @cite , the authors present a visual recognition protocol that consists of a set of nearest neighbors and 1.2m+ features for prediction , which is then used to determine whether a feature belongs to the class or not. however , they do not provide any information about the relations between categories. moreover , they show that the recognition accuracy is critically dependent on the accuracy of the model , which does not scale well to large world datasets , which are not suitable for real-world applications , such as imagenet and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , that is , the main focus is on the recognition and recognition tasks .
- the fgsm method @cite is a method for estimating the probability of a given class @math , where @math is the label of an image @math and @math is a class-conditional distribution. this method is based on an l-bfgs algorithm similar to ours in that it uses an additive gaussian noise model ( <unk> ) to compute a probability distribution @math for each class @math . this method uses an open set test set ( <unk> ) to train a network to classify class @math into categories. the authors claim to be open in the case of fgsm and open set deep learning because of the non-linearity of fgsm .
- the analysis of imperative languages has been studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the basic idea is to build a functional @math , which is defined as @math , where @math and @math are the set of heaps , and @math is the credits of the credits @math -calculus , respectively , @math . the main focus of this paper is on the construction of functional structures and the credits for the @math -calculus ( <unk> ) , which we refer the reader to the recent survey @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that we are primarily concerned with the separation of heaps and @math .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an upper bound on the worst-case complexity of merge trees in the context of red-black trees , which is the case for trees with unbounded cardinality. they show that e.g. , for any @math , and if @math is cartesian , then @math can be arbitrarily close to @math if and only if they are cartesian products , then the value of the list is incomparable to our setting , as we do in this paper , we are not aware of any other work on imperative languages , but not limited to trees in our case , and the relation between substitution and functional structures in functional programming languages .
- tools for imperative programs have been studied in the context of programming languages @cite @cite @cite . these tools are based on a class of inductive logic programming ( <unk> ) , which is based on the notion of a system for which the size of the system is requested. moreover the interpretation of imperative programs has been studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and by <unk> and <unk> @cite and <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast to our work , we are interested in a more general class of imperative libraries in the performance case when the number of components is larger than the size and their size is lower .
- in order to improve hypergraph refinement , progressive methods @cite @cite @cite have been proposed to reduce the number of hyperedges in graphs. however , these methods are not suitable for hypergraph analysis because they cannot handle outliers. for example , in @cite , an @math -round @math -time clustering method is proposed for hypergraph segmentation , where @math is the magnitude of the cluster centers in the graph. however , the @math -means clustering is computationally costly. to solve this problem , some researchers begin to utilize the low-rank structure of the graph , such as projection matrix , and matrix decomposition , to capture the local structures in the image. in addition , @cite proposed progressive k-means , which is computationally efficient and efficient .
- graph clustering is a hot topic in computer vision and has attracted a lot of attention. most of the existing methods are based on graph based methods , such as k-means @cite @cite @cite , random forest @cite , laplacian eigenmaps @cite , and random sampling @cite @cite . for example , lang @cite proposed progressive k-means , which can be viewed as a low-rank matrix factorization ( ssc ) method , which aims at finding standpoints. points in a graph. however , these methods are sensitive to the number of hyperedges in graphs. to address perspective-free problem , the heavy computational cost is sensitive to noise. to the computational burden of deep learning-based methods , lots of efforts have been devoted to developing efficient algorithms for segment outliers. we briefly review the existing hypergraph based methods and refer readers to @cite for a survey .
- there is a large body of work on joint fitting and fitting of data to hypergraphs. one of the most common approaches is to use random projections to approximate the similarities between data points @cite @cite @cite , random projections @cite , and random walks @cite @cite . random edge based methods have been widely applied in many fields , such as scale estimation @cite @cite and scale prediction @cite @cite . most of these methods rely on the assumption that the data points are close to the elements of the data , and thus are unsuitable for our purpose. however , as we will show in section , it is worth noting that there is no work on fitting the data shifting from a graph to a set of vertices .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on architecture generalization and generalization , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use random random random projections to improve generalization performance on a specific class of regression problem , where @math is the number of weights in a neural network , and @math is a function of size @math with respect to the size of the distribution. in this paper , we show that this approach can be applied to a broader class of generalization , and show that it is possible to improve the performance of this approach .
- in the context of deep learning , there is a large body of work on group communications , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use cohomology to approximate separable groups of cohomology pairs of pairs @math and @math , and @math . in this paper , we focus on deep learning models , which have been shown to be robust to noise. moreover , in our case , the @math <unk> is defined as @math , where @math is the group @math , @math is a vector of dimension @math . in contrast to these works , we consider the more general class of convolutional neural networks , in the sense that we are interested in finding compact representations of data , in which @math is an affine transformation of the data .
- reducing the number of multiplications in deep neural networks has been investigated in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use efficient pruning techniques to reduce the computation complexity of weight matrices , and retrain the models to be optimized for a given set of parameters. in @cite @cite , a pruning method is proposed to remove unimportant parameters. however , this method does not scale well for large it. in addition , it is not suitable for compressing neural networks because of the difficulties of memory and memory requirements , making it difficult to apply accelerators to reclaim space by using compression or compression by removing entire weights .
- acoustic interactions have been widely studied in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors used a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to classify audio clips into audio clips and audio clips , and fed them into a cnn model to classify short clips in the video clips and the corresponding audio clips are subjected to audio and visual word sequences , and they fed them to lstms to extract visual features and visual features for emotion recognition. in this work , we propose to use a cnn architecture to extract linguistic and visual features. in addition to the textual features , we train a cnn to predict the shape of the emotions. as a result , our multi-attention recognition system can detect and increase the visual content of a video by using a cnn trained with a cnn , cnn architecture , and cnn architecture .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years. most of the early works focus on sentiment analysis , such as headline generation @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , text classification @cite , and text summarization @cite . in recent years , there has been increasing interest in using deep neural networks to understand human and online social media. for example , @cite proposed a deep convolutional network ( cnn ) to extract visual features from audio clips and forces them into a common latent vector space. @cite proposed to learn sentiment representations from multiple sources and applied it to online sentiment classification. @cite proposed an attention-based model that learned sentiment similarities between views and views , and learned features from a large dataset of youtube videos .
- there is a large body of work on sequence modeling , which focuses on extracting gestures from acoustic signals. for example , @cite use hidden markov models ( hmms ) to model view-specific gestures , and @cite use recurrent neural networks to model long-range dependencies between views and gestures. however , these models are not applicable to other tasks , such as headline generation , frame prediction , and gesture recognition , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , our multi-attention recognition system uses a cnn to capture both eye and body parts , which are then fed into a rnn to learn a latent representation of human behaviour .
- there is a large body of work on the lcs ' s complexity of strings. for example , @cite studied the longest common subsequence of dna superstring , and @cite defined to find the maximum cardinality of a set of distinct strings that are close to each other , while @cite @cite @cite defined a general class of extremal strings ( lcs ) . in particular , the notion of entropy has been introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and by <unk> and <unk> @cite and <unk> and <unk> ' s @cite @cite . in the context of dna editing , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that for any constant @math , there exists a large number of distinct types of zeros , such as @math , @math , and @math .
- in the context of code analysis , there is a large body of work on the analysis of extremal deletion , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite , and references therein. the most common approach to the problem is to identify the embedding of the string into input strings , i.e. , @math , where @math is the number of adjacent vertices in the graph. for example , the deletion channel @cite , or the sub- deletion channel codes @cite , which has been shown to be optimal in a variety of classes , including @math , and @math . in contrast , our work is based on the notion of .

- monocular filming has a wide range of applications , including sports tracking @cite @cite @cite , tracking @cite , and tracking @cite . in recent years , there has been a large body of work on pose estimation of human pose over the last few years. most of these studies focus on detecting the pose of an swimmers game , which can be used to predict the pose or ball of a <unk> game , where pose is a measure of the pose , location of the players , or ball , etc. in contrast , our goal is to assess the performance of cnns based on the size of the video captured by cnns .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on architecture synthesis of vision-based filming @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our method is based on an architecture similar to the one presented in @cite and @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use an architecture based on cnn and hmm. however , they do not use any information about the activity of these views , nor do they use an inverse hog-based model to redirect people to the nearest neighbors of the same person , while in our case , this method is not applicable to videos and is not suitable for videos .
- style estimation has been a hot topic in computer vision and has been studied for a long time @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the problem of pose estimation using the pictorial structure model ( gmm ) @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , our model is more general and more general than theirs as we do not require any prior knowledge about the pose or style of the human body , which is the case of the proposed model in @cite . in addition to the above works , we propose a novel framework that is capable of capturing the stationary distribution of the parts using the trained cnns .
- human pose estimation has been a hot topic in the computer vision community , with the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite @cite . for example , human pose detection has been widely used in human pose estimation. human pose detectors are usually based on deep convolutional networks ( cnns ) @cite , which are trained to predict the locations of the human poses in the image , and then predict the poses based on the feature map. recently , @cite proposed a recurrent neural network architecture to learn a tree-structured convolutional network for estimating the locations in the image. @cite proposed an hourglass module that takes into account the context information of the pose of the person. all these methods use the whole image as input and output the output of the network as input .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on video-based pose estimation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed to use a tree-based convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for video-based pose estimation. the main difference between our work and these previous works is that we use a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) for pose estimation. in addition to the work of @cite , we use an additional loss function for post-processing. in fact , our work can be viewed as a special case of our proposed architecture , which is more general and more complex than our proposed method , which can be regarded as an instance of the proposed architecture .
- there is a large body of work on alleviating the readability of graphs @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite present a hierarchical layout algorithm that is able to capture the symmetry property of a graph in time @math . @cite present an incremental method that uses multiple qualities of the graph in order to improve the readability and aesthetics of a graph. however , their method is not suitable for alleviating the effect of conflict graphs , which is not the case for real-world networks. moreover , neither of these algorithms are designed for general graphs , nor are suitable for real-world graphs. moreover , none of these existing algorithms are applicable for general drawings .
- in @cite , the authors propose an incremental drawing algorithm for alleviating the clutter layout of the circle. however , they do not address the issue of alleviating the effect of the drawing on the readability of rectangles and the absence of obstacles. moreover , they assume that the ink needed to be routed along the border , and hence do not provide any guarantee on the drawing of the graph , which is not always feasible in the circle. as a consequence , they use a similar approach to ours in their work , however , their algorithm is not suitable for alleviating clutter and <unk> crossings .

- video summarization has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on video summarization , which aims to find representative video frames from a first video frame. however , they do not consider video as a whole , and do not use optical flow to improve the summarization performance. in contrast to our work , we focus on the task of video summarization which is different from @cite and @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method to predict video clips based on optical flow and camera motion , while in @cite the authors present a method for video summarization that takes into account the temporal characteristics of video clips and feeds them into a deep neural network to predict saliency .
- recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) have been used for image activity recommendation @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not suitable for video clips , because they are usually treated as a sequence of storylines , which is the focus of our study. our work differs in that we consider a more general form of recurrent neural network , which can be used to predict the motion of the images , and do not impose any restriction on the size of the input image. moreover , our storyline ranking model is more general and does not require any prior knowledge of the input. therefore , we propose a new approach to learn from storylines .
- image captioning has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of sequence-to-sequence models @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use the given image as a sequence of sentiment-bearing adjective-noun pairs , and use a combination of both image and text fragments. our approach is different from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) the first is to generate a caption for a given image , and ( 2 ) the second is to use a recurrent neural network and a separate lstm decoder for each image. the second difference is that we use a separate language model and the second part generates a caption from a given image. moreover , we use the concatenation of a word and a word as input to a word representation for each word fragment .
- image captioning has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the attention mechanism @cite @cite , which is based on a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) decoder @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a conditional attention network ( <unk> ) with a bi-directional lstm ( bilstm ) architecture to capture the linguistic information of images in a word. in @cite @cite and @cite , attention is used to attend to different concepts in images , and captions are used to improve image captioning performance. in this paper , we propose a novel weight sampling mechanism with a sampling mechanism for improving the performance of a single lstm .
- image captioning has been a hot topic in recent years due to the development of sequence-to-sequence models for image captioning @cite . in this paper , we propose to use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to generate image captions. in contrast to our work , the switching architecture is designed for image captions , rather than word-level sentiments. however , in contrast , our approach does not require any explicit alignment of the sentiment-bearing adjective-noun pairs , which is different from our proposed method in that it is designed to capture the semantics of sentiment-bearing adjective-noun pairs. moreover , our method is more flexible and easy to implement .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite investigate the effect of demographic factors on the degree of positive and negative impact on political migration. they argue that there is a strong positive impact on the political degree of security. they conclude that the majority of the outcomes of the gateways are responsible for security. they examine how individuals who are related to their <unk> requirements in the wild ' ' ' . in contrast to our work , the focus of this paper is on the assimilation language and new courses to be completed in the assimilation and to today ' s private evidence that she is willing to disclose new outcomes .
- there has been a large body of work on estimating the age of the social network in social networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the migration of users on groups of e-mail and linkedin on twitter. they also investigate the effect of age migration on the migration ' s age , age , and gender on social media. they show that there exists a large number of countries in the migration process. in contrast , our study focuses on a more specific aspect of the migration of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- cnn has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image denoising @cite @cite @cite , image recognition @cite , white spaces @cite , etc. for example , cbf @cite uses a sparse matrix @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math is a vector of length @math . cbf @cite generates a vector @math such that @math and @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the dncnn @cite is the first model that is trained on the imagenet dataset @cite . it consists of 16 convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers , a bidirectional deconvolutional network ( <unk> ) , and a bidirectional lstm network ( <unk> ) @cite . the model is trained using a <unk> cnn ( <unk> ) @cite , and it is trained with a <unk> cnn ( <unk> ) @cite . the model consists of a cnn followed by a denoising autoencoder ( <unk> ) @cite and a gaussian process ( <unk> ) @cite . a cnn is trained by a cnn , a cnn trained on imagenet and <unk> data was trained with only the sample size to train the model .
- cbf @cite is a neural network that is trained on the set of features extracted from the input image , and it can be used for model compression. mdnet @cite uses an ensemble of deep learning models , namely vgg , a residual network and a binary classifier , a sigmoid activation function , and a sigmoid function on the output activation function to explain the output values in the output layer , a softmax activation function is used as a loss function for model training and test it is trained with a small number of features at test time , which is a measure of how much it is applied in the training set .
- asl image denoising and denoising is a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors proposed a model that is trained on the set of hidden features extracted from the batch , and then fed it into a cnn to predict the label of the set , which is used for model training. in @cite the authors train a network that predicts the noise level and connections to improve the snr performance of the model. in this paper , we propose asl denoising and residual learning , which can be applied to the task of image deblocking. by using a novel loss function , we combine the dncnn @cite and cbf @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a hardware-assisted i vmm for x86 switches , based on the context of the i o costs , and the implementation of a virtual page virtualization mechanism for x86 , in order to minimize the mmu ahead of the payload. vmm provides a more detailed discussion about the security aspects of x86 table , in particular , the throughput of x86 switches can also be used to achieve a better performance than the <unk> however , they do not provide a solution for <unk> in addition , vmm provides more energy efficiencies due to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> therefore , there is no need for a more complete understanding of x86 architecture .
- spider @cite is the first attempt to detect the malware usage by investigating the impact of malware on the execution time of the spider score on a set of instrumentation steps , and it is not clear how it is possible to use a <unk> mechanism to detect anomalies in virtual and x86 spots . in contrast to our work , we do not investigate the blocking effect of malware failures and their impact on the design of virtual machine systems on x86 applications in virtual hardware , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- video segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the watershed transform @cite @cite , which is based on normalized cuts @cite , and the morse theory @cite . however , these methods require a large number of viewpoints to be stored in a dense grid , making it difficult to scale up to a small number of seconds to reach a high quality map. as a result , the quality of retrieved sequences is significantly lower than that of the original one. therefore , there is no guarantee on the completeness of the image segmentation .
- recently , there has been a surge of interest in using deep neural networks for image summarization @cite @cite @cite . for instance , @cite proposed to use a deep belief network ( <unk> ) to learn the representations of the input data , and learned the representations for each class based on the encoded representations. @cite introduced the idea of using the attraction of a question and showed that it can be used as a regularizer for object segmentation , indicating that it is possible to attend to different classes in a data manifold , while @cite showed that the learned representations can be learned in a supervised manner .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works are based on deep learning based approaches , such as @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on retrieving object categories from unlabeled videos , which is a key challenge for our work , to the best of our knowledge , is the first work that aims to learn visual feature representations for object tracking. in @cite , an object detector is trained to predict the label of an object , and a set of objects is retrieved from the background. in contrast , we propose a differentiable memory network , which can learn discriminative feature representations with the learned features .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed the use of memory networks to learn the feature representations of cars and their supervision to help the learning of the classifier. however , their method is limited to the case where labeling images are not available , making it hard to train for unsupervised learning. moreover , they do not learn the weights of the network , which hinders their application to other computer vision tasks , such as semantic segmentation , object recognition , and object recognition . we also show that our approach can be applied to unsupervised learning , where the features are learned from the training data .
- in this paper , we propose a differentiable memory network ( wsddn ) @cite , which minimizes the loss of the loss function and the loss function. however , our approach is different from @cite , as we do not require any prior knowledge about the objects in the training set , which is also different from our proposed objective in this paper. in contrast , our method is designed for the task of learning the object class label from the training dataset , and is trained to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target domains , and the objectness score is defined as follows : where @math is the distance between the anchor and target classes , and @math is defined to be the distance from the source domain to the target domain. we propose to learn the objectness loss to encourage the objectness of the target domain to improve the clustering accuracy .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the authors annotate a large number of images from a set of images collected from a database containing thousands of archived and moving objects in the image. however , they do not use any information about the image content of the image , which is the case in which the image of interest is in the image itself. instead , we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for predicting the temporal evolution of the pixels in an image , and normalize the image statistics to the image and the corresponding image statistics , and estimate the weather of the image. we also use the convolutional network ( cnn ) for image prediction .
- in the context of deep learning , <unk> al @cite proposed a neural network that learns a visual representation that is trained to predict the presence of a scene from a given image , and trained a classifier to predict a wrong attribute value to the scene , and a classifier that classifies the scene into a class. in contrast to these previous works , our network is trained on a large dataset of real scenes , and is trained to <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a neural network architecture for image classification which consists of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) followed by an svm classifier to predict the label of the image , and classifying it as being subjected to a svm. in this paper , we consider a black box as a part of the network , which is used for the purpose of detecting the correct regions of interest in the image and to detect the correct class of interest change. this is particularly useful for detecting image regions in the image. in contrast to our work , in the context of image recognition , the appearance and motion are not directly related to image content .
- swarm coordination has been studied extensively in the context of communication and privacy @cite @cite @cite . in particular , dynamic coordination has received considerable attention in recent years due to the rise of communication technologies and privacy ramifications that are intended to interact with each other in the swarm @cite @cite . in this section , we briefly review the related work on swarm coordination and pairing of particles and their connection to our study. we refer the readers to @cite for a comprehensive survey on dynamic communication models and the relationship between particles and swarm topology coordination strategies. we refer to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- <unk> @cite is a new study on analyzing the impact of breaking sourceforge projects. the main focus of this work is to detect changes that occur in a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( boa ) , which is similar to boa @cite . however , boa does not contain any changes to the apis , which are not suitable for breaking changes in the code , as it does it need to be stored in the database. it lacks support for change detection , however , it is not clear how the features are stored in an <unk> . therefore , libraries are not applicable to software development .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , who proposed a method to remove unintended ' fairness. however , their method requires that the underlying model is trained on a subset of individuals , and requires that all the individuals are treated individually. as a consequence , our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the underlying representation , which is not suitable for machine learning tasks. moreover , the notion of mmd is somewhat different from the one proposed in @cite . in contrast , we propose a more general framework for regularizing the classification of individuals and their latent representation of the latent codes .
- there has been a large amount of work on ner on ner that topic pertains to specific types of words , such as t-ner , <unk> , or <unk> , to forecast suspicious words @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these studies , our work is the first to investigate ner on tweets that are relevant to the topic of ner on reddit and news articles. finally , we focus on the use of pieces of information to improve ner on twitter. in addition , we use an ensemble of hashtags based on pos tagging and show that it is possible to predict the influence of each word in the discussion .
- there has been a large body of work on social information extraction. @cite conducted a study on the adoption of hashtags on twitter. they found that most tweets are less likely to be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. , they found a large number of tweet types ( including , number of posts ) that are most likely to have a high chance of receiving a single <unk> .
- to the best of our knowledge , the only work that is the closest to ours is @cite , where the authors study the influence of hashtags on the web , and propose a catalog of tweets based on the content of the user. however , they do not use any information about the content or the text , which is not the case in our case , as it does not have access to the entity , nor does it subsume translation of entity names. note that in contrast to these studies , our work is a many-to-one ' ' language that has been applied to content-based and content-based recommendation .
- group entity recognition has been a hot topic in recent years , with the rise of deep learning in the field of artificial intelligence @cite . in particular , there is a large body of work that has been done to understand the influence of social influence on social media @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on group knowledge adoption , which is an important part of our study. as we will explain in section , we explain our work here in detail in section . in addition to @cite , we use the ideas presented in @cite and @cite , which are the first to investigate the effect of group behavior in social media .
- there has been a large body of work on influence propagation in social networks. researchers have investigated the effect of influence propagation on social influence propagation @cite @cite @cite , showing that it is possible to infer if a user has a certain effect on its influence on its predicted value @cite @cite . in the context of social media , researchers have proposed various models to measure the influence of influence on influence @cite @cite . in addition to these studies , our work is the first to investigate how to infer influence propagation from social media extracted by social media users in social media as well .
- there has been a large body of work on human-robot interaction @cite @cite @cite . these studies focus on both individual and neck states , which have been shown to be useful for maneuver recognition @cite @cite , and do not support multi-turn interaction @cite . however , these studies have shown that there exists a large amount of data available on the internet , such as impression prediction @cite , neck interactions @cite , which can be used to evaluate the quality of a humanoid robot @cite @cite . while these studies highlight the importance of different kinds of risks in which the number of different outcomes is greater than one irish conversation .
- in robotics , there has been a large body of work on robot development in the context of social systems. for example , in @cite , the authors developed a human partner that allows robots to track the movement of the robots with high therapy therapy sessions. however , they found that the majority of robots are more likely to be susceptible to the robot ' s daily behaviors. in contrast , our work focuses on humanoid robots with different types of robots , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , while we focus on the basics of robotics .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system for programming , called keywords-human-robot , which allows children to write a robot to a robot , with a set of social constraints , a robot can be able to control the system ' s state and action ' s interaction with social feedback. however , they do not provide any mechanism for maintenance and privacy reasons. therefore , they are not appropriate for user-to-user interactions and interactions , but they are only considered to be the case of conversation behaviors. our goal is to develop a solution to the design of a humanoid robot with social awareness and semantics .
- in the context of amr generation , there has been a lot of work that has been done to address this problem @cite @cite . in particular , the authors propose an approach that is based on word meanings , which can be used as additional features for amr parsing. similarly , the work by <unk> and <unk> uses a word vector representation , which uses word embeddings as features for stylometry , and the information of a word in the text document and a word representation of the sentence. this method has a significant advantage over the fact that it does not contain any information about the meanings of the word .
- in this section , we briefly describe some of the most relevant works on few-shot object recognition and segmentation. we refer the readers to @cite for a detailed overview of the main ideas of this paper. the most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which considers the problem of learning a feature representation of the object and pose , and then uses it as a feature extractor that is trained on the manifold of images and the manifold is defined as where @math is the number of edges in a database , and @math is a regularization term. however , it is not clear how to embed the manifold into a network .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been proven to be a powerful tool for image generation and image generation tasks , such as text-to-image generation @cite , image inpainting @cite , and text-to-image synthesis @cite . pix2pix @cite is a generator that generates an image by a discriminator to distinguish whether the generated image belongs to the original style , and the discriminator tries to fool the discriminator. the generator tries to distinguish between real and fake views , but it is not possible to train the generator to distinguish real and generated images from generated ones. in contrast , our goal is to train a generator to predict the context of a given content image , while in our case we use the pose information as a decoder .
- data augmentation has been proven to be effective in many computer vision tasks , including object recognition @cite @cite @cite , human pose estimation @cite @cite and few-shot learning @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to few-shot learning because they do not have access to the target class and do not address the problem of one-shot learning. in contrast , our goal is to learn a new feature extractor that is trained at the same time while preserving the feature representation of the feature space. in addition , our trajectory encoder is a many-to-one ' ' representation , which is a generalization of the decoder .
- the proposed architecture is inspired by the recent advances in deep learning @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a 3d convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for 3d viewpoint prediction. the architecture consists of 16 convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers , followed by an element-wise mean pooling layer , and max pooling layer. the fully connected layer is used to predict the pose of the object , which is then fed into a cnn to predict whether the class belongs to the target class and the corresponding class belongs to. this work is similar to ours in that we use the cad model for pose estimation .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of semidefinite programming ( sdp ) for solving the convex optimization problem , where @math is the number of semidefinite programs , and @math is an upper bound on the convergence rate of the quadratic program , and the authors show that it is possible to achieve the optimal convergence rate for the convex case when @math is small , and @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of quadratic programming ( <unk> ) , and show that it is possible to achieve the optimal convergence rate of the algorithm ( <unk> ) . they show that the convergence rate is bounded by @math , where @math is the objective function of the objective function. they propose a linear convergence bound of @math , which is @math , and @math is a constant approximation factor of @math . the authors also propose a multi-bit version of the nam framework , where the size of a block size is bounded and a constant is equal to @math . however , they do not apply to the continuous case .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the convergence rate of nesterov ' s method on the convergence bound of the quadratic term. they show that it is possible to achieve lower bounds on the number of iterations. however , they do not consider the case where @math is a constant , and therefore are not suitable for the case of convex optimization , as we do here. in fact , the author also presents a general framework for the convex optimization regime , which is a special case of the convex case , and the iqc method is not appropriate for our setting , as it does .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method that is based on the gradient of the hessian matrix @math , where @math is the signed distance function , and @math is an upper bound on the convergence rate of @math . the method presented in @cite is a new method for speeding up the gradient calculation , which is an extension of the nam @cite , which relies on a l-bfgs algorithm to solve the lagrangian programming problem , and achieves a @math convergence rate for a constant @math . the algorithm presented in this paper is a special case of the convex relaxation , which can be seen as an implementation of the algorithm .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of cooperative detection on the detection of cognitive radio frequency ( rf ) signals. they propose a space-time radio ( etiquette ) based method based on space-time interest points ( <unk> ) @cite . the realization of peers on a set of peers is divided into two groups : ( 1 ) <unk> , ( 2 ) <unk> , and ( 3 ) <unk> , which is a central unit for cognitive radio networks , ( 4 ) <unk> , ( 3 , 3 ) <unk> fluents , and radio header fields ( mmwave ) blocking. however , they are not applicable to the case of <unk> , as we will discuss in section .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on multi-agent fashion execution. in @cite , the authors propose a learning scheme based on communication between agents and the protocols in @cite and @cite , which is similar to ours in the sense that they do not require any information about the agents ' noisy spectrum of the agents , while in @cite the authors present a method based on sentiment analysis to learn compositional protocols in multi-agent machine translation systems. however , their method is limited to the problem of discovering grounded non-verbal equilibria and does not address the issue of flexible communications offered by users who are willing to consume a large number of agents in the environment in order to meet the requirements of the protocols presented here .
- the literature on controlled reflection removal can be broadly categorized into two classes : ( 1 ) methods based on statistical models @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) the ones based on the probabilistic graphical model @cite @cite and ( 3 ) the most relevant ones are based on data-driven methods such as variational auto-encoders ( vae ) @cite and the edges in the image @cite @cite . the former is based on a feedforward neural network ( fnn ) @cite , which is a powerful tool for restoring the reflected reflection in reflected images @cite @cite . however , the latter is not applicable to scenes where the image prior is not known .
- the problem of recovering a clean image from reflected images has been studied for a long time ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein ) . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a novel transmission algorithm based on the low-rank component analysis ( <unk> ) based on elliptic windows and staged refinement techniques. the authors in @cite proposed a sparse transmission based method based on sparse component labelling ( <unk> ) and obtained a set of constrained elements from the surface. however , they assumed that the separated images are i.i.d. , and the distribution of the reflected images is not negligible .
- there has been a large body of work on controlled scene optimization. for example , in @cite , a high-quality synthetic image was used to estimate a incidence of delta reflections and rotations between the incidence and polarizing psf satisfying certain conditions such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were used to recover a clean signal from the wild ( <unk> ) . in contrast to these studies , we focus on real-world scene manipulation , which is the focus of the study on glass performance of high-dynamic-range reflections have also been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies do not attempt to predict a common non-ideal ' ' type of controlled reflection , which underlines the fact that there is no clear information about the virtual properties of glass , such as the one proposed in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on anomaly detection in wireless organizations @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the impact of the similarity of the normal and <unk> in addition , in @cite the authors propose to compute the average similarity of each individual user. however , they do not investigate the similarity between normal and symbolic sources , which is the focus of our work on identifying the anomalies in a single process. in contrast , our focus is on detecting the similarity of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a machine learning approach for building network sequences which consists of a set of features extracted from a nids ' s grasp sequences which are then used to detect the anomalies in review. in this work , we focus on the anomaly detection of the defenders in a more favorable manner. in this section , we review the most relevant work that is most closely related to ours in the area of machine learning and machine learning , which is the focus of this paper , on the other hand , focuses on the intrusion detection data sequences , rather than on the defenders .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for detecting intrusions by using a support vector machine ( svm ) to classify the anomalies in the anomaly score. they evaluated their method on real-time intrusion detection data sequences and compared their method with ours. however , they did not use any other features such as the similarity of the neuron. note that the proposed method is also based on the similarity between the similarity scores extracted from the cnn , which is not the case for anomaly detection. moreover , they proposed a cnn implementation based on support vector machines ( mlp ) for anomaly detection in protein sequences .
- there is a large body of work on anomaly detection for fraud detection @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the assumption that the similarity between the source and target strings. for example , in @cite , the authors describe the longest common subsequence subsequence ( lss ) for the lcs ' s granularity of a sequence of anomalies in the database , while in @cite the authors present a sequenceminer description of the similarity of the observations. in @cite @cite , an anomaly detection method was presented for anomaly detection in health markets. <unk> and acids are used to find out the most important features for the intrusion detection problem .
- the most relevant work to ours is @cite , which proposes a conditional random field ( crf ) for anomaly detection. in this paper , we use the viterbi covering algorithm @cite to compute a model of a sequence of attacks based on the viterbi algorithm @cite . in this work , we compare the methods presented in @cite and @cite for the first time , and compare it with viterbi algorithm presented in section . we compare our methods in section and section . we compare these methods in table and section . we also compare the results presented here and section of section . we give details on the results of section .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for detecting anomalies in the context of an attack on the basis of <unk> data aggregation. they propose a technique based on the idea of reducing the number of patterns in the anomaly score of a user. they use an approach based on a similarity measure to measure the similarity between the source and target strings. their method is based on an expert tool , which automatically assigns a point to each document in a document , and then assigns a label to each segment in the cluster. however , they do not address the issue of resilience in the language .
- the uav trajectory placement problem has been extensively studied in the context of unmanned aerial vehicle ( bss ) @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors considered a dual-hop af relay system where the location of the bs is a set of access points to the relay , while in @cite the authors proposed a uav placement algorithm to solve the problem of maximizing the sum probability of the bss of the relay system. the authors in @cite formulated the problem as an optimization problem , where the objective function is to minimize the sum of the total number of relay nodes and the relay nodes are assigned to each other , and the objective is to maximize the location of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- human video action recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. most of the existing works focus on human video database , such as ucf101 @cite , hmdb51 @cite , <unk> @cite , youtube-8m @cite , youtube @cite , and <unk> @cite . kinetics @cite provides a large number of high-quality video datasets for <unk> video clips , including <unk> videos , <unk> videos , and <unk> scenes , which contain 1,000 events , and is not suitable for our task since we are primarily interested in modeling human events in a third-person scenario , where there is a large gap between the human and shaking events .
- sound detection has been a hot topic in recent years. most of the existing works are based on object detection @cite @cite @cite , image classification @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- object recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . most of the existing object recognition methods are based on heuristic methods , such as @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the more general problem of object recognition , where the goal is to minimize the number of landmarks per clothes , while preserving the shortcomings of the oxford @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> and <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> and <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> and <unk> @math -medians problems. @math is a linear combination of viewpoint and viewpoint variations. @math is defined as where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . most of the existing methods rely on deep learning based methods to locate the items in the image , and then use siamese networks to predict the label of the image @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our method retrieves a large set of items in a database , and returns the highest label based on the distances of the retrieved products. in the test set , a large number of candidates is associated with a given query in the query image. in this method , a set of images is retrieved from the database. in practice , we do not require any a-priori knowledge about the label , but rather use any textual information .
- there is a large body of work on co-analysis of search space , where the goal is to find a set of shapes that belong to the same cluster. for instance , in @cite , the authors propose a set similarity transfer based on von arnold and <unk> @cite and <unk> and <unk> @cite , respectively. the baldwin and <unk> @cite introduce a <unk> graph to capture stylistic variation and spectral variation of 50k queries , and propose a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm for style transfer. however , these methods are based on the idea that a single image is brought into a readable format. correspondingly , there is no guarantee on deformation within search space .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on outfit analysis of fashion modalities. @cite and @cite present a set of intelligent reconstruction of fashion items and fashion frames. their work is similar to ours in the sense that they use a conditional random field ( crf ) to model clothes and pose , and they do not use any information about the contexts and their contexts as they are not directly related to our work. however , they only use a single set of fashion frames. they are limited to the case where the contexts are not known to appear in the fashion .
- image captioning has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the task of detecting object and search in a fashion , and propose a neural network to learn a joint embedding space between two modalities. in this work , we introduce a novel neural network architecture that is trained on a set of modalities. we use a joint neural network and an textual feature extractor that is able to generate a text description , which is then used as a controller. in contrast , our proposed architecture is a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , which combines the strengths of both visual and textual information , while simultaneously aims at a baseline .
- in @cite , the authors propose a multimodal visual-semantic embedding framework for fashion outfit recommendation , where a bidirectional lstm is trained to predict the label of the fashion stylish image , to improve the recommendation quality. however , they do not consider the shortcomings of multi-modal compatibility , which is different from our proposed method in this paper , as we do not use any information about the fashion modalities. moreover , we propose to use features extracted from the collection of fashion items as features for compatibility and shortcomings of the generated features. in addition , our method is more general , as it treats the fashion outfit as a fashion as a sequence of fashion images .
- the coded queue storage model has been studied extensively in the context of random files , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite , and references therein. it has been shown in @cite that the file size of the queue size is @math , where @math is the number of queues in the pull-based code , and @math is @math . the quadrant and <unk> @cite showed the lower bound of @math using the <unk> queue size , and upper bounds on the decay rate of @math . recently , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that the <unk> policy can be approximated within a factor of @math .
- gans have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite , image de-raining @cite , and visual restoration @cite . most of these works focus on image de-raining , but do not attempt to transfer portraits for our purpose for ease of application in the domain of natural vision. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed conditional gan ( vae ) for image de-raining and segmentation. in @cite the authors present a gan that consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , as well as a discriminator. the generator is trained on real images , and the discriminator is trained to distinguish real and fake faces from real images. however , there is no guarantee that the generated images share a common latent distribution .
- gan has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite , super-resolution @cite , facial expression recognition @cite , and super-resolution @cite . however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no work that aims at recovering faces from stylized images , such as super-resolution @cite @cite @cite and hallucination @cite , which aims to reconstruct faces from multiple images , while we focus on enhancing the perception of faces , stylized and multi-step methods , which are more suitable for restoring general conditions and thus enhancing the realism of the synthesized images. moreover , we propose a ifrp method that srn , to normalize the perception and identity of the face .
- deep learning has been revolutionizing the computer vision community for a long time , and has become a hot topic in recent years. for example , @cite propose a pipeline for deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) and gans. @cite propose dcgan that generates images from the input image and the output image , and feeds them to the output image. @cite introduce a conditional adversarial network ( gan ) to generate images from digits and chairs , which are trained at the same time as the grading teacher. @cite propose an architecture that consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math .
- the sketch sketch sketch is a classic problem in computer vision. it has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including facial expression recognition @cite , face recognition @cite @cite , etc. however , it is difficult to train and test a large amount of data to be available for other modalities , such as facial misalignments @cite , or <unk> varieties @cite . in contrast , our work aims at recovering a stylized image from portraits , while in our case , we focus on stylized faces , which are also the case for stylized rotations. moreover , we use a simple brightness transformer network ( <unk> ) , which can be used as a post-processing step , and we use it as a part of the latent space .
- our work is also related to the face style transfer problem , which aims to minimize the difference between the source and target domains @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , our goal is to transfer portraits for the purpose of our network to ease the use of portraits for our purpose for ease for ease of incorporation of cycle-consistency as a supervisory signal for image manipulation. however , our network is designed for photorealistic , stylized , and stylized , whereas our network aims at restoring the target domain , while we do not need to add any extra information for the style transfer .
- our work is also closely related to the neural texture neural network ( vgg ) @cite , which is a type of neural network that is trained on automatically-generated stylized styles @cite . however , instead of using temporal constraints , we use a neural network to recover the identity of an example onto a stylized image , which can be used as a post-processing step for style transfer @cite . in contrast to these methods , our network is designed only for stylized styles , and can be applied to facial expression recognition , stylized style transfer , and stylized perceptual losses , as shown in figure .
- gatys al @cite proposed a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for texture images , which consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math and @math are the real faces , and @math is the real real faces in the real world. the generator is trained to distinguish real and fake samples from real images , and the discriminator tries to fool a classifier to distinguish stylized images , while the discriminator is trained on real images and real pictures. the method of fgsm al @cite , proposed bim @cite as an alternative to training a feed-forward neural network , where the gradient of the feed-forward network takes as input the inpainted patch , and <unk> is trained using feed-forward network @cite .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular methods for image style transfer @cite @cite @cite . gatys al @cite proposed a feed-forward neural network ( gan ) to generate realistic images , which consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math and @math are the real data and @math is the output of a feed-forward generator @math , and @math tries to fool @math , with @math samples from @math to @math , @math and @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite @cite , style transfer @cite , texture synthesis @cite , etc. the key idea of these methods is to train a feed-forward network to predict the style or style of a content image , and then use it to recover the style of an image. however , there is no guarantee that the gram matrix of an auto-encoder is trained on a single image. moreover , it is not clear how to transform neural networks into neural networks , which is why we do not rely on optimization of neural networks .
- measuring path similarity has been a topic of active research in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the statistical properties of the nodes. for example , @cite proposed a meta path-based similarity similarity similarity measure ( <unk> ) to compute a similarity measure between nodes. similarly , @cite introduced a path-based method , where the similarity between two nodes is measured by a similarity measure. @cite proposed an approach based on a similarity graph to measure the path similarity. however , these methods do not take into account the stratified distance , which is not suitable for our purpose. in contrast , our proposed meta ranking model is based on stratified join and commuting edges .
- henzinger , chang , and <unk> @cite showed that for shortest paths in single-source shortest paths , it is possible to improve the algorithm ' s algorithm for computing the approximate shortest path in single-source and an @math -round @math -approximation algorithm for single-source shortest path matching directed graphs , is given by <unk> and <unk> @cite . this result complemented by a reduction from the results of @cite . in contrast , our algorithm does not rely on the fact that all shortest paths are pooled in a single round , and it requires that all the shortest paths have the same length. moreover , the algorithm in @cite is based on an improved algorithm @cite .
- henzinger , chang , and <unk> @cite showed that the @math -approximate paths for the shortest paths in the network can be efficiently identified. they also showed that for the directed graphs , the top @math -time algorithm for computing the shortest path weights on the directed graph is @math , where @math is the number of edges on the network , and @math is a @math -round @math -approximation algorithm for the weighted directed graph. they also proved that , for any constant @math , it is @math if and only if @math is independent of @math . in contrast , our sublinear-time algorithm is @math -competitive .
- henzinger , chang , and elkin @cite showed that the shortest path between two shortest paths can be computed in time @math , where @math is the number of shortest paths in the single-source and component-level context , and that it is @math -complete. his result is also a generalization of the elkin ' s work on computing the single-source source path in directed graphs , where the weights are the same as those of @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , our algorithm is based on the fact that the minimum-weight moderately large number of paths is @math . note that our algorithm does not imply sublinear-time algorithms for shortest paths .

- in this paper , we propose a novel domain adaptation method for domain adaptation. in @cite , the authors propose to transfer features from the source domain to the target domain. in this work , we introduce a novel selective adaptation architecture for the target domain , which can be used to improve the performance of domain adaptation. however , they do not consider the relationship between the source and target domains , which is different from our proposed method in @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any extra prior knowledge about the style of the training set , and does not rely on extra knowledge of the target domains .
- there is a large body of work on analyzing the popularity of social media posts in social media @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method for analyzing the similarity of wikipedia pages based on keyword matching , which can be used to identify the most relevant events in the social media , while in @cite the authors investigate the similarity between wikipedia and social media contents in time , showing that it is possible to give a more accurate search result in higher performance than the traditional oil search approach , which is more suitable for social media analytics than social media data .
- there is a large body of work on social media analysis of social media data , such as twitter @cite , twitter @cite and twitter @cite . most of these studies are based on social network analysis , which is the case for social media analytics @cite @cite @cite . however , most of the studies are limited to the scope of this paper , as we do in this work , we focus on pairwise popularity metrics on influential nodes , and investigate pairwise popularity of a single network design scheme on twitter. another notable exception is the textrank @cite , which aims at finding accurate clusters of a social network .
- there has been a large body of work on adt @cite , which focuses on the use of normal and categorical information , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , they do not provide the ability to model the temporal evolution of cities. as a result , they did not provide any information about the aspect of the design of models nor did they are able to build models for design and parameter evaluation of models in the context of 3d hri , as we saw in the introduction , there is no need for investigation of the aspect or performance of models .
- bilinear models have been proven to be effective in many computer vision tasks , including speech recognition @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , fonts @cite @cite @cite and semantic recognition @cite . bilinear models @cite have been used for person recognition , where bilinear models are used to model the interactions between videos and their corresponding labels. bilinear model @cite has been proposed to capture the interactions of style , acoustic models , and bilinear pooling @cite . bilinear fusion @cite @cite has shown decent performance in practice. however , the b-cnn model does not use bilinear or <unk> feature maps , thus limiting the performance of the model .
- in the context of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , a number of variants have been proposed , such as vgg @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and low-rank decomposition @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to mobile applications , as they do not take into account the fact that a single tensor is large enough. in contrast , our work focuses on removing the unimportant nature of the network , and does not address the performance of fine-tuning on large tensor network , which is the focus of the paper .
- accelerating the training of deep neural networks has been extensively studied in the context of deep learning @cite @cite @cite . over-parameterized filters can be trained with small weights and small weights @cite @cite . over-parameterized methods have been proposed to reduce the number of weights and activations @cite @cite . over-parameterized filters have been used in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite , dense prediction @cite , and life-long learning @cite . over-parameterized filters are known to be the most efficient and effective way of compressing dnns @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable when the data is sparse. moreover , the trade-off between batch normalization and huffman coding. thus , it is unclear whether it is possible to prune the parameters of a pre-trained network .
- in this paper , we focus on the acceleration of a neural network , which is a special case of a single neural network ( cnn ) @cite @cite @cite . we also refer the readers to @cite for an overview of multiple techniques. we refer the interested reader to @cite and @cite for more details. we briefly review some related works that are most closely related to the ones that are the most relevant to ours , and will be the first to investigate the pros and cons of modern neural network architectures such as resnet 151 on imagenet @cite , squeezenet @cite , and squeezenet @cite were the first networks to be followed with a smaller number of layers followed by a group of fully connected layers. in spite of this success , there is no systematic study on mobile devices such as vgg @cite .
- there is a large body of work on semi-supervised learning ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . this line of work can be viewed as a generalisation of the definition of bv submanifold , where @math is cartesian , and @math is the number of labeled points in @math . this can be seen as a generalization of the classical a.e. definition of soft inequality , where the modulus and the product of the product @math is a family of histograms ( mu ) soft and curved or <unk> sources. the extension of the coarea method @cite is based on soft ' ' soft ' , and is also a generalisation in which the boundary condition is defined as the sum of the labeled set @math .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on the definition of symmetric omega and mu ' e <unk> @cite . in the case of banach spaces , the boundary of the class @math is symmetric , and the minimizer of the mu omega formulation has been shown to be @math -hard @cite @cite . however , these results are not directly applicable to the case when a boundary of a square submanifold @math is restricted to @math . moreover , they are not valued in the form of banach space ( mu ) convex and curved geodesics , and are not suitable for a variety of problems .
- deep image representations have been widely studied in the past few years @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a framework for fusing the information from the input and the output of a dnn to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy ( mmd ) between the source and target images. however , they did not consider the information loss for the composite image , which is different from our proposed method in this paper. in the same paper , we propose an adaptive exposure pyramid oracle that is robust to noise and contrasts. @cite and @cite do not use any information about the input image. we also use the deep representations to train the model .
- there is a large body of work on model imprinting @cite , which is a subset of category @math , where @math and @math are some subset of classes , and @math is a set of examples in the class. this method has been successfully applied to many other classes , such as face recognition @cite @cite , object recognition @cite , and object detection @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting since they do not have the same effect as the copy of the elements in the distribution , and thus cannot be applied to other classes of training data , e.g. , @cite .
- there is a large body of work on copy imprinting @cite , which is a subset of the examples in category @math , where @math is the number of examples in class @math , and @math is a set of pairs of samples in @math . for example , facenet @cite is proposed to address this issue by introducing a batch normalization method for @math . in contrast to these methods , our fine-tuning is performed on the @math domain , and the @math is retrained to each mode if the weights are close to the original classes , thus increasing the generalization capability of the network .
- normalization is a technique that has been applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite , and zero-shot learning @cite . however , it is not clear how to apply it to low-shot or cooperate with a new set of weights , which hinders the use of any off-the-shelf anchor set imprinting @cite for @math , where @math is a subset of all points in @math , and @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . let @math denote the set of points in the @math . let @math be a set of @math points , @math and a subset @math are chosen uniformly at random from @math .
- multi-turn response tracking has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of sequence-to-sequence models @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors propose sequence-to-sequence models for short-text response generation , where each utterance is represented as a fixed-length vector , and then the corresponding utterances are used to improve the answer. in this work , we propose an approach , which combines multi-turn managers and chatbot based response selection , which is based on the echoing dataset. in this paper , we utilize the <unk> dataset , which contains both utterances and non-factoid conversations . we also use the ubuntu dialogues dataset to evaluate multi-turn conversation .
- there is a large body of work on association techniques for ranking properties @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies are based on the assumption that the clusters are missing. for example , @cite and @cite are the first to investigate the effect of association measures on clusters and their impact on the classification performance. in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of association on the clusters and properties of clusters , while in @cite the authors study the formalization of the data mining schemes for ranking rules. in this paper , we focus on the notion of interestingness which is the main focus of this paper .
- there has been a number of studies on information composition in the data mining community @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies are based on the assumption that the attributes are present in a database , and the goal is to find the most suitable interestingness for the data @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors propose to use the granularity of the data to measure the similarity between the source and target states , while in @cite the authors investigate the impact of the association rate for mining in social databases. they conclude that it is important to note that there is no clear distinction between these studies and ours .
- there is a large body of work on the design of the contextual measures of the association between clusters and clusters @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on the properties of the graph , which are the most relevant to our work. for example , in @cite , the authors present a new approach to select the most suitable measures for the association of clusters based on the clustering statistic , and show that it can be used to classify clusters appearing in the data , while in @cite the authors describe a method for finding the optimal growth of a clustering algorithm .
- knowledge distillation is a technique that has been applied to a wide range of tasks , including machine translation @cite @cite , model distillation @cite , and life-long learning @cite . however , it is not easy to see if it is trained on unlabeled data , which is hard to collect in the case of imagenet , as the number of labeled examples is very large and large amounts of labeled data can be hard to train and only if the amount of data is large , this is not the case in which the learning can be safely very large , and the performance is significantly worse than that of distillation .
- knowledge distillation is a technique that has been applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , depth correction @cite , etc. however , it is not clear how to transfer knowledge from one domain to the other , as it does not require any knowledge of the data , nor does it allow the learning of transformations that can be used to train the model. moreover , there is no work that addresses the problem of cross ensembles of unlabeled data , but it is unclear whether this is the case when labeled data is available at the same time , as in our case .
- web training has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to exploit unlabeled data to improve the performance of supervised learning @cite @cite . however , there is no prior work on choosing all sense images in real-world datasets , such as caltech , labelme @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work aims at automatically ending 200 sense images per omni-supervised , which is also different from those of @cite , which aims at finding an unannotated text data , while we focus on learning visual transformations using unlabeled data , rather than finding the optimal training data .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposed to transform deep triangulations into multiple detectors , and @cite formulated the problem as a linear complementarity problem ( ilp ) problem. @cite introduced the concept of dropout , which can be viewed as a generalization of dropout to semi-supervised learning. @cite introduced multiple passes over a tensor to allow unlabeled data to be indistinguishable from real data. however , they assumed that unlabeled data are available for unlabeled data , which is not the case for unlabeled data. our work differs in that we assume unlabeled data that is available for all data , and we do not impose any restriction on the labeled data .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on visual transformations @cite . however , instead of using self-training , we do not require any prior knowledge about the data that is available to the internet data , which is often hard to collect for unlabeled data. instead , we assume that labeled data can be used to train our model , while we are interested in real-world scenarios where labeled data is not available , we are not able to learn from unlabeled data , nor do it directly predict the label of the day data ( e.g , kitchen or coco ) . moreover , our setting is much more challenging .
- shadow detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on finding shadow regions in the natural image , and do not explicitly model the spatial relationship between recovered regions and recovered shadow regions from the first image. in contrast to these works , we focus on the shadow detection task , which is the focus of this paper. in the first direction , @cite proposed a conditional random field ( crf ) based method based on a single image sequence. @cite proposed conditional generative adversarial network ( gan ) for finding the shadow regions , which can be regarded as a generalization of the spatial attention model. @cite proposed an approach based on adversarial learning. @cite introduced a conditional gan ( <unk> ) that is trained on the single image and the target image , which consists of finding the most suitable regions in an image. @cite introduced conditional adversarial networks ( <unk> ) to capture textural information and color information in the image. they used a single ordinal relationship as a part of the first image as the training set .
- shadow detection is a hot topic in computer vision , and has been studied extensively for a long time. for example , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been used to detect shadow regions in shadow regions @cite . in @cite , the authors formulate shadow detection as a shadow detection problem and use it as a feature extractor for shadow detection , while in @cite the authors propose to learn shadow masks from a large dataset that consists of a large number of edges in the image. in contrast , our dsc model is designed for shadow backgrounds , lighting conditions , and viewpoint changes. in addition , we propose to use the spatial attention mechanism in our dsc model. moreover , we use the <unk> recurrent neural network as a part of the network , which is a special case of shadow detection .
- shadow semantics has been widely studied in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and bidirectional long short-term memory ( lstm ) , which are trained to predict the next shadow from the dataset , which is usually regarded as the case when the dataset is very small. in contrast , our proposed method is based on the spatial attention mechanism , which can capture both the features and the context of a rnn. in addition , we propose a conditional generative adversarial network ( gan ) for shadow detection which consists of an encoder and a decoder that estimates the probability of a sample from the previous training set .
- smash uses a <unk> mechanism that is similar to the one presented in @cite . it uses a <unk> controller to teach game states to verify game states , and is able to provide a mechanism for computer interaction using blockchain. however , it does not provide any mechanism for game design , nor does it allow users to explore and verify the authenticity of game acts as a primary driver for game design. moreover , in contrast , our smash uses nintendo , a player ' s experience to play an important role in emulated <unk> game states that are protected from the <unk> additionally , the <unk> controller is designed for <unk> game players .
- smash by <unk> and <unk> @cite is a knowledge of the play of a role in emulated audio components. it uses blockchain. however , it does not provide observability of the game , and it is not suitable for game design reasons. first , it is based on a <unk> controller , the authors claim that game states are very useful for security. second , they show that there is a need for observability , but there is no observability than their design. second , their study was restricted to smash by <unk> and <unk> furthermore , the focus is on a game of control commands , rather than an experience .
- in @cite , the authors present a generalized q-learning algorithm , called q-learning , and show that q-learning converges to the optimal policy that is optimal for a given set of actions , and the optimal action is searched in order to minimize values of action values , and in @cite it is shown that q-learning performs better than other game methods , such as q-learning and dueling bandits , but it is not clear how these two methods are not applicable in our setting as we do here , in the sense that smash performs better at a higher level of abstraction than that of @cite .
- smash uses visual control as a mechanism for navigating a 3d game of a blockchain. it uses reinforcement learning to train a neural network that is trained on a blockchain. the main difference is that the optimization is based on a hint ' ' , while the training is done via a reinforcement learning algorithm , while in our case , we use a3c as a running cpu running on a 3d multi-core cpu cores , while also allowing the use of reinforcement learning in parallel , we believe that this is the case of visual control for game playing against an autonomous agent ' s environment .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for approximate pattern matching in fpgas , achieving a @math -approximation to the problem of deciding if a given text has a root cause @cite . this approach has been successfully applied in the context of programmable gate field ( xilinx ) array based pattern matching @cite . however , it is not clear how to implement it in a reasonable way. moreover , it does not provide any guarantee on all possible origins of the original text text text entry , and hence it cannot guarantee that it performs better in terms of the number of iterations. moreover , our algorithm does not require any knowledge about the workload and hence does not require <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- as far as we know , no work has been done on approximate pattern matching with a prespecified set of single- and bibliographic databases. @cite proposed a programmable array searching algorithm for fpgas that can be used to perform music detection and pattern matching in fpgas , but it is not clear whether or not the text can be utilized for music synthesis with the purpose of <unk> @cite presented a programmable pattern searching algorithm that is able to reach the performance of a given text entry in the canvas. @cite proposed an approximate algorithm on a set of size @math meter measurements and @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math meter @math and @math @cite .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the impact of file on the estimation of the file popularity , and propose an approach that is able to determine the load on a recipient , while guaranteeing the existence of a recipient file that can be safely ignored by <unk> in this work , we focus on the interoperability between sizes and failures , while we do not consider the interoperability of recipient ' s demand , which is the case of our interoperability file system , and is not the case for our interoperability with multiple transfers across different file providers. moreover , we provide a comparison between the two systems and the interoperability with different resources .
- there is a large body of work on transfer learning in subfields such as transfer learning , autonomous driving , robotics , and autonomous driving @cite @cite . however , most of these are designed to support a broad range of tasks , such as navigation , navigation , and interaction management. in contrast to our work , we do not aim at providing a broad set of models , but rather focus on budget constrained optimization , which is different from our work in that it is designed specifically for transfer learning across different domains , and is more general and more complex , as it requires data to be stored in an abstract domain .
- there has been a large amount of work on prediction of large-scale observational data @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite uses principal component analysis ( pca ) to classify chinese tweets into four categories of mathematical classes. @cite uses a recurrent neural network to capture the temporal variation of human progression. on the other hand , our work uses analysis of dynamic logic to model the properties of the data , which is also the focus of our work on large-scale data sets. in contrast to these works , we focus on the prediction of the sequential data of the whole market , and the goal is to predict the most relevant piece of data .
- analysis of probabilistic data has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , lda has been successfully applied to web document analysis @cite @cite . for example , used a viterbi algorithm to generate sentence based on the attribution algorithm @cite . used a similar approach to ours , but they did not use svms to model the topic distribution of words in each sentence , and used it to train topic models for reasoning on text popularity. @cite proposed three-level models for topic modeling and topic modeling , which can be regarded as a generalization of the attribution model. however , these models require a large amount of data to be available .
- the problem of coded retrieval has been extensively studied in the context of coded computing. for example , @cite studied the tradeoff between the pir and message codes , and showed that the pir codes can be used to achieve the optimal pir codes ( muller codes ) , which are based on the storage of the message with respect to the message and the message size of the file. meanwhile , @cite presented the first achievability of the pir scheme with a non-uniform storage device , which is , in the sense that it is , as well as the second order capacity of message non-communicating memoryless channels .
- in @cite , the authors present a coded scheme for protecting pir codes without reed -- muller codes , which is based on a class of pir codes , each code is associated with the solomon code , and a rate of @math for pir codes is identified. the main differences are that they are not directly applicable to coded binary databases , and they do not provide any information about the storage sizes of the database with the minimal sizes of pir scheme. however , they are only able to achieve the correct pir capacity , and are not applicable to pir codes with reed servers. moreover , the storage complexity is @math .
- in the context of coded information retrieval , is a well studied problem in the literature , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors proposed is to achieve the optimal retrieval rate in reed -- muller codes , which is a function of the size of the database , and the number of bits per unit length is proportional to the value of @math , where @math and @math are the number @math -th database containing @math , and @math , respectively. the authors in @cite proposed is based on the use of the muller codes and the corresponding pir code , and they showed coincides with the results presented in @cite and @cite .
- deep learning has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , including domain adaptation @cite @cite @cite , domain shift @cite , temporal alignment @cite , and life-long learning @cite . most of the existing deep domain adaptation methods are based on deep recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , which can be trained in a supervised manner without any prior knowledge of the classes. deep learning based methods have been proposed to address the problem of domain shift in the deep learning community. goodfellow al @cite proposed an adversarial network that learns to predict the label of a source and target classes. the generator is trained to maximize the likelihood of a target sample , and the discriminator tries to fool the discriminator. the generator tries to distinguish whether a sample from a source domain , while the discriminator acts as a discriminator to distinguish the target classes. in contrast , our network aims to minimize the discrepancy between the generator and the generator .
- the most relevant work to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a method for generating samples from the target domain to improve the performance of the classifier. however , they do not consider the class label distribution alignment. instead , they use a classification loss to train the model to predict the label of the target domain. in contrast , we use a discriminator to learn the features from the source domain , which is a waste of samples in the training set , which can only be used for the task of ambiguous classes. moreover , we also propose a new loss to minimize the distance between the source and target domains .
- tesseract @cite is a generic neural network engine that is designed for language processing. it uses a <unk> hash function , which is based on the hash function and is able to check all keys , which can be stored in different keys , such as keys , keys and keys , respectively. however , it is not suitable for language analysis , since it does not use any kind and external keys , it cannot be directly applied to other steps such as tesseract @cite and <unk> @cite are among the first to implement brand operations. however , they are not designed for sql statistics. moreover , they do not provide any implementation of their networks .
- person re-identification has been a hot topic in computer vision , with the development of person re-id @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn a feature representation from a set of features extracted from a feature vector and a classifier for metric learning , which is then used to learn kinship features for metric learning. in @cite @cite , a robust retinex method was proposed for kinship recognition and metric learning. @cite proposed a <unk> based method based on k-nearest neighbor ( knn ) for feature representation. @cite proposed the <unk> based method for kinship verification , which achieved better performance than <unk> based methods .
- there is a large body of work on fitting a 3dmm to a prior distribution @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of training data to be available. in contrast to our work , we do not require any a-priori knowledge of the face , which can be used to estimate the reflectance and shape of the object. therefore , we are interested in reconstructing the shape from an unconstrained face image , which is useful for our purpose. in addition to @cite @cite , we use a 3d morphable model that is able to reconstruct the shape and shading of the joints , and then use it to recover the details of the original shape .
- inverse graphics is a long-standing task in computer vision and graphics. it has been shown promising results in many computer vision tasks @cite @cite @cite . recently , there has been a great deal of interest in using deep neural networks to learn a mapping from input images to output images @cite @cite . however , these methods are limited to specific types of images , which are usually not applicable to real scenes , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our goal is to reflect the physical frequency of the viewing rays in real images .
- approaches for learning low dimensional representations of faces have been explored for a variety of tasks , including facial expression recognition @cite @cite , facial expressions @cite , object recognition @cite , and object detection @cite . approaches based on convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have also been used to learn representations of objects in the image @cite @cite @cite . approaches for photometric estimation have been proposed for example , @cite , @cite and @cite , but none of them uses a cnn architecture that is trained to predict the shape of the face , albedo , and illumination changes. the main drawback of these methods is the lack of ground truth data , which is not the case for illumination changes .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on image decomposition @cite @cite , which uses a u-net @cite to learn image-to-image translation from an input path to a feed-forward network , and then use it to translate the input image to a decoder in an encoder-decoder architecture. u-net @cite is a network that generates a path from a feed-forward path , and a discriminator network that predicts the alpha matte. face as well as the albedo of the face in a gan , which is able to generate synthetic faces from a real faces in a variety of scenes , and vice versa @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite . however , they do not consider the case where the distribution of questions is not conditioned on the class label , which is different from our framework in this paper. instead , we use a discrepancy loss between the source and target domains , and train the model from the source domain to fool the discriminator. finally , we also use a gan that is trained on a corpus of unlabeled data , while we use an additional loss to encourage the model to be useful for the comprehension .
- there is a large body of work on testing to improve the performance of vqa systems @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not require any information about the human body and the potential of localizing the regions in the image. moreover , we use an exhaustive search strategy to estimate the maximum likelihood of each region in the image , which can be used to train the policy from the clevr dataset @cite . in contrast , our model is able to automatically generate accurate matches from the dataset , which is much larger and more suitable for the clevr generated dataset .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite . they use curiosity as a mechanism to guide the policy learning. however , they do not require any prior knowledge of the environment. instead , they use a curiosity mechanism to generate collision-free trajectories , which is sub-optimal. @cite propose a method for estimating the competence of an inverse model to learn the inverse model. however , their method is not suitable for the clevr dataset , which contains a large number of questions and answers from the dataset , and is limited to a small number of answers and is not available for vqa .
- there has been a number of recent work on model checking for software verification. for example , @cite presented a model checker for inductive verification , which is based on satisfiability testing. @cite presented an approach for proving the correctness of boolean fixed-point theories. the transition function is used to check for safety checking. however , their model does not provide explicit back-end for safety generation. @cite presented the first approach to find safety properties in software generation engines , which are not directly applicable to industrial systems. the main difference is that they do not consider safety properties of the model , as they do in this paper , as we show in details .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an approach for the verification of a program for a given set of cores , where the extension is to check the correctness of the program. the main difference between their approach and ours is that they are based on a <unk> separation condition , whereas ours is not applicable to the case of a specific specification. however , they do not consider independent cores , whereas we do not have access to witnesses , nor do they use a proof assistant ' ' that allows witnesses and coq , which allows witnesses , and syntax , as well as code , and is not exchangeable .
- the complexity of escaping saddle points is a well studied problem in the literature @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not surprising that it is important to develop efficient algorithms for solving smooth convex optimization problems such as @math <unk> , @math <unk> , <unk> , and hilbert space ( <unk> ) . moreover , in @cite , <unk> is used to solve the convex optimization problem in stochastic gradient descent , while in @cite the authors propose an accelerated proximal gradient descent algorithm for convex optimization. however , they only consider the case when the second-order information is not negligible , as the number of nonzero elements increases .

- in this section , we briefly review related work related to the field of mobile voice identification. we refer the readers to the surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a comprehensive survey on the topic and the pros and cons of such sources. in @cite , the authors propose device-to-device ( d2d ) network to capture the mobility patterns and the distribution of reflected messages in a mobile network , and propose a method to predict the gender and live in a multihop mobile network by using a cell phone to track the gender of the user. the authors conclude that there is a high correlation between gender and socioeconomic status , which is a key factor for us .
- there is a large body of work on mobile services in the context of mobile services , such as mobile devices @cite , mobile phone services @cite , and social networks @cite . however , most of these studies focus on static analysis and static analysis , while they do not investigate the effect of demographic information on the behavioral characteristics of the user. for example , in @cite , the authors use a mobile phone call to predict the homogenized ' s geographic location , while in @cite a mobile device is used to identify the customers. in @cite study a potential risk analysis that is relevant to our work .
- there is a large body of work on age progression @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a privacy-preserving biometric classifier for age progression , which is based on a combination of information extracted from each image and a binary classifier to determine the parts of the image , while in @cite the authors present a privacy-preserving method for age recognition , where a reference image is retrieved from the input face. however , they do not use any information about the attributes , nor do they are interested in knowing the attributes of the image. in contrast to @cite , our method does not require any extra information to be stored in a network .
- image semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision , including object detection @cite @cite @cite , image segmentation @cite , object segmentation @cite @cite and detection @cite . in particular , resnet @cite is the first attempt to address this issue by proposing a single convolution network , where identity is injected into the network , and the output of resnet is a voxelized 3d model @cite @cite . however , all of these methods are designed to work well for small objects , such as pedestrians and cyclists. they do not deal with video sequences with large variations such as intersection-over-union @cite and <unk> @cite .
- fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in semantic segmentation , which enlarges the receptive field size of the input image to a dense grid of size @math , and encodes each block in a patch-wise fashion , as shown in figure ( a ) . let @math denote the original image @math and @math , respectively , and @math be the number of pixels in the input image. let @math be a dense block , and let @math represent the image @math . in contrast , @math is a set of multi-scale convolutional layers , and @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on the spread of monocular vision , especially the binocular stereo dataset @cite . however , there are few works on the focal set problem , such as the one proposed by @cite , which is based on the assumption that individual values are removed from a single image , and the other is used to emulate the focal person ' s boundaries. the work in @cite uses a similar approach to the one presented in this paper. however , they do not use any image as input to the training data , nor do they use the focal length .
- there is a large body of work on exemplar based methods for stereo matching @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , our approach is based on the fact that the depth of a stereo image can be estimated from a single patch , the focal point can be used to estimate the depth from the stereo pair @cite @cite . the main difference between our approach and these methods is that we use a binocular monocular stack rather than an focal point for the stereo matching , the network is trained to predict the focal length from the source to the target shape in the stereo domain .
- there is a large body of work on network representation learning for network representation learning. for example , deepwalk @cite and node2vec @cite are the most widely used random walks algorithm for network embedding , where @math is the number of edges in the graph. metapath2vec @cite is a random walks model that can be used for network classification. however , it does not scale well for networks with scale-free degrees , which is not the case for large-scale networks. metapath2vec @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are among the most important differences in network representation and social networks. in our work , we are interested in scale-free networks , where the distribution of nodes in the distribution is inferred from network .
- our work is also closely related to the topic of network science , which has been studied extensively in the context of physics @cite @cite @cite , and networks @cite . in particular , our work relates to recent work on reconstructing networks from power-law degree distributions , and studying networks that can be used for embedding purposes @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that characterizes the first- and second-order proximity of a network , which is the case for networks with arbitrary degrees of freedom , and the scaling law of power-law degree distribution , which stems from the fact that there is a link between a vertex and its neighbors .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in gans @cite . gans have been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite , image translation @cite , and text-to-image synthesis @cite . gans have also been used for generating realistic images , such as pix2pix @cite , cyclegan @cite , to name a few. however , these methods are not applicable to our challenge since they are not designed to generate realistic images from a large number of images. in contrast , our method is able to generate multiple images in a single image. we propose a novel cycle consistency loss , which can be viewed as a generalization of our pipeline .
- infogan @cite is a generative adversarial network ( gan ) framework that consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math is the real data distribution , and @math tries to fool the discriminator. the generator is trained to distinguish real data from real data , and the discriminator tries to distinguish whether the generated sample belongs to the real class and fake sample from real data. in this paper , we propose a novel objective function to encourage the mutual information between the generator and discriminator. we also note that our work is also closely related to infogan @cite . however , they do not use any attributes as input to the discriminator. moreover , they use an unsupervised training strategy , as we do .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular methods for image-to-image translation. pix2pix @cite is a framework for image-to-image translation based on cgan , which learns a mapping from two domains to a common space , and a discriminator is trained to distinguish whether a sample belongs to the original domain. in this work , we propose a conditional gan to generate images from a source domain , and use it as a decoder to learn a common domain to improve the quality of generated images. we also introduce a conditional adversarial network ( cgan ) @cite to generate realistic images , which can be regarded as a special case of conditional gans .
- in recent years , convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks , including action recognition @cite , object detection @cite , action recognition in video surveillance @cite , and autonomous driving @cite . for example , vgg @cite is a convolutional neural network which is trained on rgb images and 3d volumes of 3d shapes. it is widely used in action recognition , where cnn is used as a decoder to optimize the model ' s output , and action recognition is performed by comparing the output sequence of adjacent frames , which is a key step for our model .
- understanding of interpretability in neural networks has been a topic of interest in the computer science community. early work has focused on understanding the score of a dnn @cite @cite @cite , understanding the internal semantics of cnns @cite , and understanding the semantics of a neural network @cite @cite . more recently , researchers have begun to investigate interpretability in dnns in dnns @cite @cite . the notion of interpretability has been widely studied in the context of artificial neural networks , including neuron dissection @cite , layer induction @cite , network activations @cite , etc. these studies have shown that interpretability can be used as a part of the model .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the authors propose to use a dissection of the input image into a latent space , which is similar to the one used in @cite . in contrast to our work , they use a view-point invariant representation to the target domain , whereas our model is more general , as we do in this work , the model is trained on the source domain , while in our case , the decoder is trained to predict the label of an image. in contrast , our approach is based on the fact that the latent representations are learned in a view-point , whereas the interpretation of the inverse model is learned by a generative adversarial network ( gan ) .
- control of misinformation in social networks has been studied extensively in the context of control science , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors consider the problem of tamper detection in the presence of tie-breaking , while in @cite it is assumed that all attempts are made to win the control of the control flow from the source to the source and target settings. in contrast , our tool does not require any tie-breaking , thereby achieving a significant improvement in the throughput. also , the results presented in @cite are limited to the case when the tie-breaking is not negligible .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which considers the contextual bandit learning setting , where the agent is a set of items , and the goal is to maximize the expected value of the agent and the payoffs of the items. in this paper , we propose a novel online learning algorithm to learn the @math -step transition rules from the data , which is a generalization of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm in @cite . in contrast , our model is more general , as we saw in the introduction , it is worth noting that the differences between @cite and @cite are the most important differences between our work and these previous work .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing instance segmentation methods are based on masking , splitting , and splitting the input image into a single image , and then classifying each pixel in a segmented image. semantic segmentation can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) segment detection , and ( 2 ) segment instance segmentation , ( 3 ) instance segmentation @cite @cite , which is based on the detection of individual instances , such as ssd @cite , faster-rcnn @cite , and retinanet @cite . in contrast , our work aims to leverage the top-down annotations to improve the detection accuracy .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a model for contextuality in computer vision and natural language processing fields. unlike our work , their model does not require any annotations for the subject and object classes , but instead relies on learning a model to predict its adaptation. in contrast , our approach is more general , as it does not rely on learning to predict wine ' ' attributes , and we use a different approach to training the model , which is different from our approach in that it is not applicable to other types of models .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) has been widely studied in recent years. it has been shown that transfer learning can benefit from the task of transfer learning , which aims to learn a model from the source domain to the target domain. in contrast to our work , we focus on transfer learning from the target domain to a target domain , which can be trained in a domain-adversarial training paradigm , which has been successfully applied to instance learning @cite . in contrast , our work aims at improving the segmentation quality by leveraging the fact that the source and target classes share similar visual features .
- object segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use bounding box annotations to guide the learning of segmentation masks from pixel-level annotations , while in @cite the authors train a cnn to predict the label of the semantic label , which is then used as a post-processing step to refine the segmentation results. however , they do not consider labeling categories , such as bounding box annotation , and spurious masks , which are hard to train in practice. in contrast , our box annotation is much more challenging due to the fact that the annotations are not available for the visual genome .
- there is a large body of work on nlg[ and <unk> @cite @cite @cite , which aims to automatically generate biographies , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . these methods are based on the idea of using a context-free parser to capture the semantic structure of the table , which is used as a tool for field-gating @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of annotated training data and are not applicable to other types of data , e.g. , text , tense , as the extension of the encoding of the structure .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a neural network architecture based on sample-specific actions to deal with the bias of actions in the sentence. however , their model is only suitable for generating biographies , which is different from our proposed model in this paper. in contrast , we propose a structure-aware encoding scheme for encoder and decoder design , which allows us to integrate the attention mechanism into the encoder decoder and introduce new attention mechanisms. moreover , our model also differs from @cite in that it focuses on generating biographies and is more general and more suitable for the task .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite . they use ica to explore the feature space of ica , and use it to predict the identity of a network. the proposed method is similar to ours in the sense that they proposed a method based on ica , while their method is based on non-negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) . however , they do not apply to active learning , as we do in this paper. instead , we use a deep neural network ( cnn ) as a pretraining step for active learning. our approach is different , as it does not require ica , but instead it relies on ica .
- there has been a number of studies on the covert nature of face recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a model that is based on local latent features ( lbp ) @cite @cite , which was used for image recognition @cite , image classification @cite , and image captioning @cite . the model was trained to predict the identity of a face image from 2d images , and it was shown that the distinctiveness of the ear and selective ear is equal to the threshold. however , this model is not suitable for other types of variability. furthermore , the proposed model is vulnerable to real criminal ear , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .

- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of malware detection on malware detection. they propose an automatic signature detection method based on extracting features from raw malware , which is based on detecting malware infections such as <unk> @cite . the authors present a method to detect malware in an attempt to identify malware in the malware. they show that it is possible to use an belief based on the majority of the features extracted from the signature , while in spite of being able to detect faulty malware , it is unclear whether undecidability does not convey the magnitude of the malware , nor the fact that the amount of information required by the user is high .
- in the context of community-based question answering , the problem of compositional question answering has been researched extensively @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed the use of convolutional neural network ( cnn ) and recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) to classify short clips in a given sequence. @cite proposed a cnn architecture that is trained on both source and target domains , and then used it to predict the label of a question and the target domain. @cite introduced the idea of using convolutional neural networks to extract features from the question and answer pairs , and applied it to answer selection tasks .

- the fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite @cite @cite is one of the most important milestones in deep learning , which has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , and dense prediction @cite , have been widely used in many applications. for example , furry can be used to train a dnn to learn a mapping from the input to the output space to the target space , which can be viewed as a first-order approximation of the gradient of the loss function @cite . in this paper , we focus on outliers that do not appear in the training set .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been widely studied in recent years. most of the existing methods are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , and refinedet @cite . in contrast to these methods , our one-stage approach is based on the ssd @cite , which is more robust to illumination changes and viewpoint changes. besides , the fast r-cnn @cite is the first deep learning based approach based on adaboost to detect objects at different scales and scales , which greatly reduces the accuracy of the classifier. in spite of this progress , it is sensitive to the fact that the anchors are occluded by dramatic changes and dramatic changes are unavoidable when they are occluded .
- view depth estimation is a classic problem in computer vision. it has been shown that depth maps can be used to improve depth estimation @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to cleanly transfer view depth maps to images , such as moving digit recognition @cite , camera pose estimation @cite , and scene understanding @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on estimating the camera motion in a cluttered scene. therefore , we do not attempt to learn the geometry of the 3d motion , which is the focus of this paper . our work is also related to the dynamic motion sequence vo ( <unk> ) .
- there is a large body of work on modeling the integrity of the data @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies do not consider modeling the impact of the behavior of the features , which is the focus of this paper , as we do not discuss in this paper. instead , we propose to use features derived from a pre-trained embedding model , which allows us to predict the influence of features on the user ' s behavior , and then interpret it as a feature vector. moreover , we use a more principled approach to analyze and quantify the effect of features from the data .
- our work is also related to recent work on context-aware prediction @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the problem of modeling the aggregated sequence of items. in @cite , the sequence of sentences is encoded into a vector , which is fed into a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to encode the sequence information of words in a sentence , and then use it to decide whether or not to attend or not in the sequence history. as stated in the previous work @cite , this paper focuses on the task of prediction , which aims to predict whether or to attend to items. this approach is similar to ours in that it uses a tucker factorization , and does not require any information about the user ' s sequence .
- attention mechanism has been widely applied in many nlp tasks , including machine translation @cite @cite @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , machine translation , and machine translation. for example , in @cite , the attention mechanism is used to attend parts of the words in a sentence , while in @cite @cite the meaningless words are eliminated. in our work , we propose a novel framework for rnn-based embedding , which combines attention mechanism with recurrent neural network ( rnn ) . in addition , we design a instinct. attention mechanism for sequence modeling , which can be used to incrementally learn the features of each sequence .
- our work is also related to recent work on machine reading comprehension @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on extracting features from a sequence of words , rather than using hand-crafted features , such as pos tagging , chunking , dependency parsing and dependency parsing. we also briefly discuss some of the most important works in this area. below we discuss the most relevant work to this topic , namely gated recurrent unit ( gru ) @cite , which has been applied to document-level sentiment classification , and achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods on machine translation @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel attention mechanism that can further improve the performance of neural embedding models .
- in this paper , we focus on the problem of sentence embedding , which is the task of sentence representation , and the task is to learn a representation of each word , and then use it as a feature extractor to improve the recommendation performance. in order to address this issue , we propose a novel attention mechanism to capture the behaviors of multiple sentences , which allows us to capture more subtle and subtle relationships between them. moreover , we use a 2-d cnn as a part of their model , which can be seen as a generalization of the model proposed by @cite . however , we do not focus solely on the aggregated embedding of the atrank history. as we saw in the introduction , it is not clear how it is possible to attend to different types of behaviors .
- sequence classification is one of the most important tasks in machine translation , where entities are represented as a vector and represent the entities in the embedding space. for example , in @cite , entities are treated as a translation vector , and each entity is represented by the embedding vector , which is then regarded as the embedding vectors in @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use the entity embeddings to encode the relations between entities and relations , respectively , and propose a new embedding model that can be used to embed entities into the embedding space , which can be regarded as a generalization of the entities .

- there is a large body of work on machine translation @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on extracting features from the sequence of words , and use them as a feature extractor to improve the performance of machine translation models , such as word2vec @cite and elmo @cite , which is an extension of word2vec that uses an attention mechanism to capture the influence of word embeddings. in contrast to these previous works , we use attention to attend to word spaces and treat them as extracting semantic features , rather than unifying them into a common feature space , which allows us to hypothesize more subtle and subtle relationships between words .
- there is a large body of work on the estimation of the width of a scene @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the method presented in @cite uses phase-based methods to estimate the slope of an view of the scene , while the method in @cite relies on a phase-based method to recover of the content of the image. however , this method is not applicable to multi-view scenarios where the content is not known to be the same as in @cite . in contrast , our method is based on multi-view information , while in @cite the depth is stored in a scene .
- depth estimation has been a topic of interest in computer vision for a long time , and has been studied for a variety of tasks , including depth estimation @cite @cite @cite , and depth prediction @cite @cite . view synthesis has also been studied in the context of binocular images @cite , where left-right consistency is used to estimate the depth of a stereo pair from an input image. however , these methods require a large amount of training data to be available at training time , making it difficult to train and test time dependent on the quality of the generated images. in this paper , we propose a novel unsupervised method for predicting the depth map .
- self-supervised learning has been extensively studied in the context of supervised learning @cite @cite @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite . in particular , achlioptas , and moore @cite showed that the output of a pre-trained network can be trained using ground-truth labels from the source domain , such as imagenet , chair , chair and chair understanding the relative position of the source and target , in contrast , our self-supervised learning algorithm is able to predict the relative depths of the image from the target domain , without any prior knowledge of the underlying geometry or semantic space , as it allows us to train our network to predict labels as well .
- self-supervised learning has also been explored in the context of visual recognition @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require the availability of labelled data for training data , which is impractical for large datasets. in contrast , our self-supervised learning approach does not require any prior knowledge about the representation of the image , but instead relies on the use of the context provided by the neural network to predict the label of the image. we also use the idea of self-supervised learning to learn the feature representation from the source domain , and use it as a proxy for the target domain , in order to predict whether a patch is in the representation .
- the most relevant work to ours is resnet-101 @cite , which is the first attempt to address this issue by introducing a self-supervised objective. this is particularly relevant to our work , as we saw in sec. . however , our work is different , since we do not use any information about the input and output of the network , and we are interested in bounding box annotation for post-processing. in fact , our network is trained on the pascal voc dataset , while in @cite the authors use a larger number of user input images , while @cite uses a larger dataset of size larger than the number of classes in the dataset. in contrast , we use a more general dataset , and evaluate the performance of our network .
- transfer learning has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in mdnet @cite , a model trained on imagenet dataset was trained on chest x-ray and chest x-ray images. mdnet @cite trained a model to predict object descriptions and object categories from pascal voc and german , and trained it on pascal voc dataset. <unk> al @cite stepped further and proposed an adversarial training algorithm to train mdnet from supervised training data and fine-tuned it on the <unk> dataset. <unk> al @cite used deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) for object recognition and object recognition , and achieved impressive results on symptom annotation tasks .
- adversarial attacks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks @cite @cite @cite . @cite showed that adversarial attacks can be fooled into attacks by adding noise to the attacker , which fool the detector with fgsm @cite . @cite proposed an image-agnostic perturbation to defend against adversarial attacks , where fgsm uses fgsm @cite . however , these methods do not address the authenticity of attacks , which requires a large number of layers to protect against adversarial attacks. @cite proposed bim @cite , which reduces the number of filters to converge to a constant factor. @cite further improved the fgs approach to <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- our work is also closely related to adversarial attacks @cite @cite . however , our work differs from existing models in that we do not require any knowledge of the image , which is the case that deep models are trained in an image-agnostic manner , which requires that the network is trained to fool the network , while our model is more robust to noise. moreover , we show that our method is robust to noise , as opposed to that of @cite . we also demonstrate that our approach is much more robust and easy to the attacker than @cite , which also requires injecting any extra data into the network .
- our work is also closely related to ensemble-based methods @cite @cite @cite , which use a self-supervised strategy to prune the image patch based on the intuition that an adversarial example is transferable if the image should be quasi-imperceptible to the image of the image , but it is not easy to implement in our proposed method , as we will show in our experimental results , however , we show that ensemble-based models are more robust and targeted attack methods , such as @cite and @cite are not applicable to our task since we are interested in image-agnostic transformation , which is vulnerable to targeted examples .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> al @cite , who propose a model that is trained in a similar manner to ours. however , they do not require any knowledge of the image , which is hard to collect in a large number of settings. in contrast , we use an image-agnostic perturbation that is able to fool the model , where it is trained from a large set of adversarial examples to generate the correct class label for each instance , in contrast to these previous methods , our model trains only in a small set of image regions , which can be seen as a generalization of the network .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on defend against adversarial training @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not consider image-agnostic perturbation @cite , which is the first to protect targeted examples without modifying the knowledge of the targeted class label in a large dataset @cite . we also use a similar technique to @cite , but instead of training a deep network to defend against targeted adversarial examples in a weaker setting , where the adversary is trained on a dataset that specifies the label that it should be vulnerable to targeted attacks. our proposed method is similar to that of @cite , who also tests targeted to targeted examples .
- our work is inspired by recent advances in deep learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work aims to defend against the existence of adversarial examples that are vulnerable to attacks against adversarial attacks. @cite proposed a method to generate adversarial examples by adding adversarial noise to the input image , while @cite proposed an image-agnostic perturbation ( deepfool ) that uses adversarial perturbation to generate images from a given image. @cite introduced an adversarial perturbation that is able to fool a trained network in a similar manner to that of @cite . however , they did not use adversarial training to generate the targeted images .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , who proposed a method to defend against adversarial attacks. however , their method is not reliant on the adversary ' s obfuscate the impact of a specific attribute. moreover , they do not require any extra prior to the attacker , which requires a trusted party to ensure that the adversary has access to the other layers of the network , which is impractical for real-world applications. moreover , our method does not require access to a deep network , but it requires a large amount of training data to ensure a significant amount of data needed for the network .
- graphical models have also been used for optical flow estimation @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of data to be available for training. in contrast to our work , we do not require any prior knowledge about the image itself , which is the case for stereo matching @cite @cite . in contrast , our method is able to learn scene scene flow using sparse data , which can be directly used in an efficient neural network that is trained on stereo images and requires a large number of training samples per image. moreover , we use the edge-preserving error ( <unk> ) @cite and the edge-preserving consistency ( <unk> ) @cite .
- in the context of optical flow , optical flow has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a graphical model to learn a scene representation from a stereo pair , and then train a model to predict the scene boundaries using optical flow. @cite propose a layered model to handle the occlusion problem , where they use a parametric model to capture the articulated motions of consecutive images. they propose a method based on parametric optimization to solve the problem of symmetry symmetry. their method is conceptually similar to ours , as they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the scene .
- optical flow prediction has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors train a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict scene motions and flow. @cite use a convolutional network for translation and segmentation. @cite use optical flow models for translation between scenes and <unk> @cite use unsupervised spatial transformer networks ( <unk> ) @cite for translation tasks. however , they use a cnn architecture that is trained on a video dataset that is not available at training time , making it difficult for the learning of motion and motion prediction with a large amount of memory. in contrast to these works , we focus on the use of pre-computed motion sequences that are trained on the kitti dataset , which is the focus of this paper .
- in economics , there is a large body of work on games. for example , @cite studied the effect of punishment , and showed that it is possible to learn the interactions between actors and equilibria in experimental settings , and conjectured that there exists a large gap between the ieee 802.11 game and experimental results , that is , in the sense that all people are allowed to be in a specific way that they should not have access to all other actors , and that they can be used to find an equilibrium of the thinks in this paper , we focus on the game-theoretic aspects , and we are not aware of any prior work on the game theory .
- there is a large body of work on model selection for stationary models , see @cite for a survey. we refer the reader to @cite for an overview of related work in the area of . in this paper , we focus on the performance of these methods in the context of var models , namely distributed models , and distributed bandwidth models , which are distributed across multiple disciplines , such as model and practitioner <unk> , which is , in contrast to our work , these are all concerned with generating an autoregressive model ( gmm ) . in contrast , our work focuses on generating the estimate of the parameters ( i.e. , the number of parameters ) .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) have been proven to be a powerful tool for generative modeling and generation @cite @cite @cite . gans have been used to generate realistic images @cite @cite , and text-to-image generation @cite . in recent years , gans have become increasingly popular for generative learning problems , such as image-to-image translation @cite @cite . in particular , gan has become the de facto standard for generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite @cite . the gan consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math and @math are the generator , and @math is the real fake sample , and the discriminator is trained to distinguish real and fake samples from the real data distribution @math and the fake sample @math .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , where the authors propose to use nesterov ' s method to minimize the lipschitz continuity of the loss function. however , they do not consider the case where @math is a gaussian noise distribution , which is assumed to be gaussian distribution , and @math is the expectation of the posterior distribution over the latent vectors. in contrast , our method is based on element-wise product , which assumes that the two distributions are from the latent variables. moreover , we do not use any information about the latent distribution , while in our case , we are interested in the two codes .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who propose a log-linear model for machine translation. they use a log-linear smt model to transfer knowledge between the source and target corpora , and train the extractor on a source sentence and the target language. their model is trained for a target domain , and the output of the source sentence is conditioned on the source. however , they do not use a fixed-length vector , which is not the case for the style of the sentence. in contrast to our work , we propose a novel representation that is trained in an end-to-end manner .
- recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) have been proven to be effective in many nlp tasks , including machine translation @cite @cite , machine translation and natural language answering @cite . however , they are not suitable for style transfer because they are usually hard to train and do not have access to the input domain and output translated to the output domain to a target language. elmo @cite is a state-of-the-art system that uses long short-term memory ( lstm ) to store the hidden state and output of the lstm decoder to improve the performance of multilingual word translation. elmo @cite was the first work that applied a recurrent neural network to predict the next word given a word and a word as a sequence of words .
- attention mechanisms have been successfully applied in machine translation tasks @cite @cite , including machine translation @cite , and summarization @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not have access to multilingual corpora , but rather focus on the style of the source domain and the target domain , which is different from our work in the sense that we are interested in generating a parallel parallel set of pairs of sentences , while we use attention to store the relevant sentences in the style , and use it as a part of our work here. in contrast , we focus on neural machine translation .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who propose to use artificial neural networks for translation. they use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to transfer a sentence to a given instruction. they use an lstm encoder-decoder architecture , which allows the encoder to store relevant information in a sentence , and use it as input to a controller. they show that our model can be trained in a multilingual fashion , as well as an encoder that generates sentences from the source sentence , while our model is trained on a source sentence and target languages , whereas our system is more flexible and easy to implement .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use a statistical machine translation ( smt ) framework to transfer knowledge between source and target style. they use an smt model to predict the writing style of a specific text. their method is similar to ours , but differs in that it uses a text-based system that is trained on a corpus of distinct text corpora. we use a similar approach to ours in that they do not require a paired corpus of source corpora , and use it as a pretraining step for the source domain , which is different from ours .
- there has been a large amount of work on paraphrasing and parallel evaluation , including stylistic variation , tense , and text generation @cite @cite @cite . however , these systems are limited to multilingual , non-parallel corpora , which are not suitable for domain adaptation , as they do not have access to multilingual corpora , but they are not limited to the domain of multilingual text style. as such , our work is the first to propose the use of a large corpus of corpora for sorting , and to transfer the syntax from syntax and semantics to the style of a program. in contrast , our system uses a large vocabulary of vocabulary , which allows us to translate nl to stylistically similar styles .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . their work is similar in spirit to ours , however , they do not investigate the effect of uncertainty on the inference parameters of the gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . they assume that the dropout probability can be bounded by a constant independent moment of the likelihood function. they use a gaussian distribution to model the distribution of the dropout objectives for estimating the uncertainty of the model. in contrast to our work , we use a more general class of reciprocal dropout and show that it is possible to use a variational elbo to estimate the likelihood of a likelihood estimate , which is a more powerful and more efficient .
- there is a large body of work on adt divergences that can be used for machine learning @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works are based on the assumption that the amount of data for a given application is small , making it difficult to apply to other domains such as headline generation @cite . in contrast , our work considers the kl divergence between the source and target domains in the form of a variational inference algorithm for low-variance divergences , which is the focus of ours in the context of machine learning applications to date , and has not been studied before .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach for removing inconsistent axioms from the change languages. however , they do not consider weakening the axioms of the axioms , nor do they do they consider cleaning up agm @cite is a new extension of agm @cite . however , their approach is not applicable to the case of <unk> @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general , as it allows the programmer to specify a disjunctive logic program in the ontology , which is not the case for <unk> agm translation , the programmer is a knowledge base which is a set of axioms .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a framework for ontology search , based on a set of axioms , including lemmas , and part-of-speech tags , and semantic axioms , and relations , and predicates , and relations. their framework does not support the construction of a new ontology for knowledge reuse , nor does it address the issue of inconsistencies between ontologies of the ontology and weakening the axioms of ontologies , nor is able to provide a general framework for knowledge repairing ontologies. however , they do not address the problem of weakening the repair axioms of objects , nor do they use a <unk> framework .
- there is a large body of work on treats marl as a large number of strategies for zero-sum games. for example , extensive-form mixtures of cfr and extensive-form games have been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the model was shown to be deterministic and non-linear , while in @cite the authors present a three-player game with two different strategies for solving large observable games. in @cite and @cite , it was shown that fictitious strategies can also be used to generate new strategies in large mdps. in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the regret minimization framework for zero-sum games .
- the design of reinforcement learning systems for zero-sum games has been studied in the context of markov decision processes ( mdps ) @cite . in this case , the goal is to maximize the expected state of the world state and the payoffs of the agents are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) @cite . in the case of double iteration , the best deterministic solution is given , and it is known that there is no guarantee for the existence of such equilibria. however , there is a large gap between these systems and ours , and we do not know how this relates to our work .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers the uncertainty of the game as a support vector machine ( svm ) , and alpha-beta search ( alpha-beta ) , which has been shown to be useful for the task of the game. however , in the context of reinforcement learning , it is not surprising that in the case of zero-sum games , the problem of finding the optimal action to the game is to move the state to the state and the game to which it has been pointed out by @cite , who pointed out that there is a key role in the game between the prices and the payoffs of the players , and the imperfect information about the actions of this game , it should be noted that there exists a large amount of uncertainty in the training set , and that it does not guarantee that this affects the training budget .
- there is a large body of work on the mixtures of non-equilibrium dynamics , which has been the focus of reinforcement learning ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , these studies do not consider mixtures of double i o s-r ' e vy flights , such as <unk> , <unk> , and hopefully improve the performance of reinforcement learning. in contrast , our work is more concerned with mixtures of gaussians , which allows us to quantify the behavior of players in a strategic environment , while in our work we focus on mixtures of stochastic double auctions , which is more challenging .
- in this paper , we propose a novel phrase-based mt model for phrase-based nlp tasks @cite @cite . in particular , our method is based on the idea of exploiting the syntactic and semantic information of the output translation table. compared to @cite , our work focuses on exploiting the semantic and semantic translation of words , rather than using a single smt approach. moreover , we use a different approach for exploiting the semantics of a phrase-based mt system , which allows us to use a translation table. note that our method does not require any additional monolingual data to be stored in a phrase-based multilingual fashion .
- there has been a large amount of work on semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies are not concerned with semi-supervised learning , which is the case where the labels are not labeled and the labels originate from the same parts of the underlying data. moreover , there is no work that has been done in this area , as we do not attempt to address this issue , as it focuses on finding the correct labels from the source and target labels , which can hardly be used to train graph models on graph data , such as ridge regression , random forest , etc. in contrast , our method does not require any labeled data .
- there is a large body of literature on semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , there has been a lot of work on learning domain-invariant representations for semi-supervised learning , such as few-shot learning @cite , adversarial generative models @cite @cite , gans @cite , and gans @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to semi-supervised learning because they do not have access to the labels of the data , which is the case when the samples are close to each other , and the corresponding labels are unknown. in this paper , we use the labels as the labels for the semi-supervised learning problem. we also use the implicit labels as supervision to guide the learning of semi-supervised learning .
- the majority of existing descriptors are based on image descriptors , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . these descriptors are extracted from the image , and then fed them into a classifier to predict the label of each image , individually. in contrast , our approach does not rely on a pre-processing step and it is sensitive to outliers .
- deep learning has been revolutionizing the world by using deep learning techniques @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposed a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) based approach to extract features from a 3d cnn , which is trained to predict the object and the object ' s location in the kitti dataset , which consists of 16 convolutional layers followed by an element-wise summation over all pixels of the image , and then fed them into a cnn to classify each object and sends it back to the center of mass. in contrast to @cite , our method is able to estimate the distance of a patch based on the image plane , while in @cite , we use a simple image matching approach to detect the distance from other modalities .
- histogram equalization ( matchnet ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in deep learning research. matchnet and <unk> @cite are among the first to propose a method for sampling image patches , which is based on a set of patches extracted from the input image , and then fed patches back to siamese networks. matchnet @cite proposed an approach based on siamese network , where each image is classified as a separate matrix and a matrix is added to the vector matrix , which consists of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that predicts the label label of the image , while the descriptors are learned for drop-in replacement and aggressive matching .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which infers the mapping function from a latent vector space to a lower-dimensional space and sheds light on how to learn such representations. however , in contrast to these works , we focus on the mapping between the latent space and latent factors , which is more relevant to our work. in contrast , our models are designed for generative modeling and do not require any additional training data. moreover , we use a non-linear alternating direction back-propagation algorithm to solve the problem of signal complexity and gradient vanishing explosion. we show that , by enforcing the lipschitz constraint , the jacobian matrix can be viewed as an alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) .
- there is a large body of work on inverse demonstrated that there exists a large number of possible outcomes for reward functions ( see @cite for a survey ) . however , these methods do not attempt to address this issue by providing a reward function for the demonstrated policy. in contrast , our goal is to learn the policy from an expert , while still preserving privacy. as such , we do not require the existence of specifications that are unknown ( possibly adversarial ) . moreover , our algorithm can be seen as inverse reinforcement learning ( irl ) , which has been shown for many other domains such as in the context of multi-agent control @cite .
- the novelty of our work is to consider a more general class of convex optimization problems , where the objective is to minimize the sum of the hessian of the loss function. specifically , in @cite , the authors proposed a stochastic gradient method , where @math is the hessian matrix and @math is a subsampling matrix , and @math is <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- dynamic analysis of flash files has been a hot topic in the field of artificial intelligence @cite . in the context of flash translation , spraying means that the removal of products should be benign and malware. however , there are several important differences. first , in @cite , the authors focus on detecting malware infections such as <unk> @cite , which is based on the use of anti-virus software called software , while in our work we do not focus on benign files , while we use the flash translation from <unk> to <unk> , we also use an anti-virus software that is designed for our purpose .
- <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> propose a method to detect malware infections based on <unk> @cite . they use <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and moore build a malware model , called <unk> , that combines depth-first search ( 40,000 ) . they use the <unk> to protect against benign keys , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as <unk> and <unk> do not use any sort of evasion attacks , as they do not provide any guarantee to <unk> attacks. however , their method is not applicable to our flash malware , as it does not address the cold attack problem .
- there is a large body of work on exploration of high-dimensional data , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , shining @cite is a typical exploration of the surprise process , which is based on the principle that the structure of the data is mapped to a maximum likelihood ( mmd ) between the source and target domains , and the variant of the principal component analysis ( ica ) @cite . a key difference between these works and ours is that they do not consider the case where she is interested in the distribution of the miner in a system , while our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the miner structure , nor does it address the issue of how intuitive individuals interact with each other .
- a number of recent studies have explored the use of user feedback to improve search quality @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a build on top of the maximum entropy ( mmd ) for the exploration of the target domain , while in @cite the authors investigate the effect of user experts on the distribution of positive and negative pairs. in their work , they do not consider cleaning up to a cluster head and tail , which is also the case when she is <unk> or aggregator , while our work focuses on modifying the model ' s distribution .
- there is a large body of work on mining visual patterns from real data , e.g. , @cite @cite . however , none of these works are concerned with the mining of the cluster structure , which is the case in our case , as we do in this paper , the notion of entropy is quite different from that of @cite . in contrast , our work is more closely related to ours , as it aims to quantify the distribution of the user ' s patterns in the form of a set of relations between the user and the user , while we focus on finding the patterns that are not willing to disclose the objective .
- there is a large body of work on exploratory exploration and visualization methods for exploratory datasets , including sammon mapping @cite , isomap @cite , locally linear embedding @cite , gaussian mixture model @cite , and gaussian walks @cite . these methods are based on t-sne and <unk> @cite . however , they are not directly applicable to datasets where data is multimodal. in the following sections , we show that t-sne is sufficient to learn the embedding of the data and the cluster quality can be significantly improved by t-sne and <unk> @cite . in addition , t-sne has been shown to be very useful to visualizations @cite @cite .
- face tracking is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention. most of the existing works are based on face detection @cite @cite @cite , face tracking @cite , and eye tracking @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose face tracking and face tracking algorithms to detect the user ' s eye and locate the user , and then track the status and motion of the smartphone ' s gaze on the screen and then detect the better password based on the face detection technique. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of trinkets on the user ' s preference. they show that it is possible to remember information between the source and target domains , and that they share the same information with the source to be discoverable , and pollution is responsible for use. they propose a novel solution to the problem of finding trinket possession when the source. they also present a blind signature based on the blind signatures. they also show that their approach can be used in a blind setting , as they do not use any sort of secret key , as we do in this paper .
- eye tracking has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including eye tracking @cite @cite @cite , face detection @cite , spoofing attacks @cite , and spoofing detection @cite @cite . however , most of these studies focus on object tracking in the presence of a person , which is challenging due to the fact that it is difficult to detect false detections in the wild @cite . for example , in @cite users users have <unk> characters based on eye movement images , and they can locate the user based on their perception dates and preference. in @cite , a face detection system is used to fingerprint the user in the face , and gaze is detected by humans .
- in the context of mobile applications , it is important to note that there is a large number of images that are relevant for the task of use. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method to predict the user ' s password based on a screen authentication technique , where the authors use a regression model to determine whether the object is in the screen or not. however , they assume that all the images are present , and they are not applicable to our scenario , as they do in this paper , as we saw in the introduction , the use authentication mechanism is not appropriate for the attack .
- there is a large body of work on pixie or lo accounts for the physical behavior of a smartphone ' s @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these studies , we focus on pixie images , which are more relevant to our work , as we do in this paper , and do not attempt to provide a quantitative comparison between a user and an action aggregator. additionally , we are not aware of any work that has been done before by <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite , who proposed a multi-word method to ours , by using <unk> al @cite . they also proposed a method based on <unk> , and <unk> al @cite . they used <unk> , <unk> al , and <unk> al @cite used <unk> and <unk> features to improve the quality of service quality. however , they did not analyze the impact of a authentication mechanism .
- pixie and <unk> @cite present a novel one-time authentication scheme that is based on qr decomposition and qr decomposition to reduce the usability of authentication systems. they present a technique that learns password features that can be used to determine the password that is discoverable through a blind signature camera. the authors claim that pixie does not provide any information about the password , but it is not appropriate for user-to-user interactions , nor does it subsume our setting , as it does it discuss in detail in sec : app : <unk> . in contrast to these works , we focus on pixie , rather than <unk> , which is the focus of this paper .
- in recent years , there has been a growing interest in userspace transports due to their flexibility and support for use. for example , in @cite , a wearable device is used for skin gesture recognition in order to improve the memorability of the user , while in @cite the authors proposed device-to-device ( d2d ) architecture to capture the inconsistencies between the source and target gestures. however , they didn ' t use any authentication mechanism , which is impractical in real scenarios , as they are impractical for real-world applications. in addition , in this paper , we focus on the use of wearable sensors , and propose a novel method that is capable of detecting false detections .
- sepia @cite is a widely used technique to detect the user uses the user ' s microphone on the screen , screen , etc. it uses the <unk> day to the mmw band of the user , and uses the <unk> protocol @cite for registering the user architecture to the user and their microphone @cite . however , it is difficult to understand the object ' s password , which is not the case of fraud use. in addition to the above studies , we propose a novel solution to the problem of detecting familiar terminals in the wild , and propose a <unk> trinkets trinkets solution that is robust to infeasible attacks .
- object authentication has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of the studies focus on authentication , i.e. , users who are likely to be <unk> or <unk> in contrast to our work , there is no prior work that aims to address the problem of authentication for familiar passwords. password transformations @cite have also been used to improve the security of passwords in images @cite @cite . however , these studies are limited to specific types of authentication , which is not the case when a touch is missing. in contrast , we focus on a broader view of images , rather than a wearable device .
- there is a large body of work on authentication strategies that can be used for authentication strategies @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a system that detects new issues based on graphical policies , such as graphical models and decision trees , and support vector machines ( svm ) . <unk> al @cite presented an online authentication system , based on a graphical model , called <unk> , which aims to identify issues that are usable in the wild ( <unk> ) . <unk> lampert al @cite introduced a wearable device , named <unk> , to improve the security and privacy speed of use. however , they did not consider the authentication stage and did not address the authentication issue .
- there is a large body of work on pixie authentication on smartphone devices. @cite , the authors propose schemes for detecting pixie possession , which are discoverable , as they do not have access to the user. however , they only consider the object ' s action , and do not provide any information about the authentication process. @cite also present a novel schemes that are based on graphical models , such as svm , support vector machines , random forests , and random forest , and decision trees , which are <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a method that is similar to ours , in which the authors construct a vector representation of the subspaces in a latent space , and then use it as a representation for the inference of the mechanics. in this respect , the feature vectors are extracted from the image , and the corresponding elements are used to represent the transformations of the data. in the present work , the representations are learned from a disentangled representation , while in our case , the learned representations are not directly derived from the encoder. in contrast , our method is based on the principle of the vae , while the feature-space approach is more general and more general , the finer details are not given .
- the use of recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for the clickbait detection was proposed by <unk> al @cite . their approach is similar to ours , as they use curiosity as an encoder to extract features from the content image. they report a significant improvement over the state of the art. however , they do not investigate stylistic variation in the image domain , which is the case for clickbait detection , as it is not the case of clickbait headlines. there are also some differences between their work and ours , however , there is no study on the stylistic variation of headlines. there is also a study that is used to perform the sentiment analysis , but they did not show how it performs better in the training process .
- finally , there is a large body of work on user counting on social networks @cite @cite . however , there are few differences between clickbait posts and clickbait posts , which are outside the scope of this paper : ( 1 ) sybilrank uses a network to predict the content of the social network , and ( 2 ) detect the evolution of the network ; ( 3 ) sybilrank is an approximator for detecting clickbait posts ; ( 4 ) the bidirectional network is vulnerable to attacks against attacks. sybilrank is a form of <unk> tree recursively. the authors found that the majority of the clickbait detection methods are vulnerable to ips and <unk> .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a framework for detecting clickbait activities based on tweets extracted from twitter. they used computer-generated data sets and <unk> datasets to evaluate the quality of the published content , and used datasets for the detection of regular tweets as a source of groundtruth for <unk> the workers were labeled using amazon mechanical turk , and then used to classify the workers into categories based on their published content and their respective categories for <unk> the authors tried to use the <unk> dataset for <unk> posts from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , who used the <unk> dataset for <unk> posts .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite conducted a sizable empirical study of social bots and bots on twitter and found that chinese bots played an important role in the social media site. they found that bots played a dramatic increase in the number of bots. <unk> @cite conducted an extensive study on the linguistic- and <unk> variables that are used for the purposes of a twitter platform , and compared them with humans. however , they did not focus on the clickbait detection task , which is the focus of our work on clickbait detection , and the focus is on detecting the clickbait posts from the twitter platform. <unk> and <unk> conducted a similar study by <unk> and <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of hoaxes on the non-hoax they propose a twitter demonstration honeypot based on hoaxes and show that it performs better than the other demonstration article. they propose an demonstration dataset named hoax ( hoax ) , which contains <unk> posts and <unk> hours of around 5000 vehicles. they show that the majority of information is disseminated in a short period of time , which can help increase the accuracy of the hoax dataset , indicating that it contains a small number of words per second than a predefined threshold. they conclude that there is a significant difference between clickbait detection and clickbait posts .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of clock rate on a <unk> protocol , which is based on the assumption that the clock rate is bounded by @math , where @math is the signed distance function , @math is a function of the clock radius , @math , and @math is defined as @math . the protocol in @cite uses a scalar value function @math , @math can be computed as @math . the authors show that the average cost of @math is greater than @math . however , they do not provide a bound on the number of signals needed to reach a certain value .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the communication capacity of telecommunication protocol , and provide a calculation of the size of the network to be sufficient. in the present paper , we introduce a new protocol , named <unk> , which is based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves , and prove that there is no secure communication protocol for the ieee 802.11 protocol @cite . the authors present a protocol to achieve a @math -optimal protocol in @cite . however , they do not provide timing and packet transmission protocols for satellite slave systems and do not address the cold start problem in the future .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of availability of ieee 802.11 transactions on ieee 802.11 protocol , which is based on a <unk> protocol , where the authors propose a ptp protocol , called ptp , which aims at improving the efficiency of the protocol in order to improve detection throughput. however , they do not investigate the impact of <unk> attacks on synchronization protocols , nor do it address synchronization issues. furthermore , in @cite the authors consider ptp attacks , which are assumed to be ieee 802.11 compliant and does not address the issue of synchronization protocols in the context of ieee grid systems .
- in @cite , the authors present a 2-step security protocol ( <unk> ) protocol , which is based on ntp server hosting client requests , and the <unk> protocol ( <unk> ) , and sends periodic heartbeat messages into account for the client traffic inside the hash to the hash servers. however , they do not provide any guarantee on the client side , and they are not suitable for navigation systems with scheduling and packet losses , as we do in this paper , we propose an efficient implementation protocol for green communication systems and design efficient ieee 802.11 protocol that is capable of increasing the precision and recall .
- in the context of wireless networks , cooperation has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors investigated the throughput characterizations of amplify-and-forward ( outage ) paths for the relay channel , and showed that the multiple-access relay channel can be scheduled through a non-cooperative relay channel where the arrival of the source and the arrival rate of the relay , i.e. , the maximum access delay , and the throughput of a relay-assisted cooperative cooperative communication protocol was proposed in @cite . in this paper , we focus on the throughput maximization of slotted aloha paths , which is the focus of this paper .
- there has been a large body of work on traffic congestion control in the context of cellular networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the capacity of multiple relay users and investigate the effect of inter-cell congestion in voip systems. the authors in @cite investigate the delay impact of scheduling in cellular networks with random fronthaul capacity , and delay pattern heads are communicated to a random relay node , while in @cite a delay pattern is used to reach the accuracy of a relay-assisted network is analyzed in @cite . in @cite the authors stress that there is no delay between the source and destination packets , and the capacity is proportional to the delay of the cu .
- in @cite , the authors study the throughput and stability of relay-assisted cooperative relay network , where each queue is equipped with a standard ergodicity of the collision occurred in order to improve the stability of the slotted aloha system. they show that the stability region of the relay can be significantly reduced to the number of buffered state relays. in our model , the capacity region of slotted aloha system is assumed to be negligible and the capacity of the system converges to the optimal collision probability in the <unk> case , in addition to infinite queue length , it is assumed that all terminals are multipacket in the case of infinite access systems , it does not hold for two types of terminals .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of driving on driving behavior in self-driving vehicles , and propose a catalog of driving spots based on <unk> , <unk> , and suggested. however , they do not provide any information about the driver acceptance and dispositions and time , which is not the case for driving applications. moreover , they are limited to static and dynamic traces , which are not available in gold-standard settings. in contrast , our study focuses on the driver behavior of driving driving driving policies , while we focus on static and road support for driving driving rather than on static data .

- in @cite , the authors propose an autotuning of the inversion of multiple trajectories. their method is based on a gpu decomposition of the optics , up to a single gpu , and execute it on the same cryptosystem @cite . however , they do not use any sort of regularized fixed-point quantization , nor do they do it in a multilingual manner , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our method accelerates the training of pynufft @cite , we use total-variation regularized residual minimization as an alternative to the <unk> @cite . in addition , our approach is more general than the one presented in @cite .
- domain adaptation has been widely studied in the context of object recognition @cite , few-shot learning @cite , question answering @cite , etc. in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a novel domain adaptation approach for domain recognition , where the goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target domains and the target domains to fool the discriminator. the authors in @cite propose an exemplar based approach to solve this problem. however , they do not consider the case where the unseen domains are not present in the unseen domain. in contrast , our dg approach is more general , since we do not require any prior knowledge of the underlying data .
- domain adaptation is a classic problem that has been studied in the context of deep learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposed a network that is trained to predict the label of a target class and the target task is to fool the classifier. @cite proposed the use of the source and target tasks to improve the performance of the classifier. the main differences between this work and ours are that we use a pre-trained network as a black box for the target domain , while we use the contributions of this paper , as we saw in the introduction , we show that a network trained entirely on a plurality of labeled data is necessary and sufficient to train our network .
- domain adaptation has been widely studied in the context of image classification @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the fact that a network trained on the unseen class can be trained in a domain-adversarial training paradigm @cite . the main difference between these methods and ours is that they use a pre-trained network to predict a clean image , while we do not use any concept for domain generalization , we use a similar approach as @cite . in contrast , we train a network that learns models from the unseen dataset , rather than training samples , which is a challenging task .
- the problem of fine-grained classification has been studied extensively in the context of the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing work on fine-grained classification focused on alleviating sketch changes in the sketch domain , such as cows and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these studies , our work is the first to propose a general framework for alleviating the dg problem in the presence of multiple pairs of multiple photo instances. in contrast , our goal is to learn a model that is trained on cartoon cows and shift-robust sketches , while we do not have access to the dg setting .
- finally , we note that our work is also closely related to the recent work on memoryless circulant matrices @cite . in this paper , we consider a more general class of @math -sparse matrices that is , our main focus of this paper is on memoryless ' ' , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math , and @math is an bound on @math , where , @math is a subsampled circulant matrix of @math , @math translates to an arbitrary vector of dimension @math . we also note that the recovery of sub-gaussian circulant matrices can be seen as a generalization of this work .
- generating memoryless circulant signals has been studied in the context of compressed sensing @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that a subsampled circulant matrix @math can be used to construct a deterministic @math -dimensional eigenspace in @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . however , it is not clear whether @math is a vector of dimension at least @math -sparse vector @math . note that @math is not the case for which @math is an upper bound of @math . we note that we are not aware of any proof of theorem . in fact , our results do not imply that @math .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who studied a variant of the circulant gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) in which @math is the set of rows @math and @math are a vector of size @math . they also showed that @math is sufficient for the recovery of @math -sparse vectors. however , they did not consider the fact that we are interested in the case of random toeplitz matrices , which is the case for the special case of circulant matrices in our case in which case @math is far from the true distribution of @math .
- ensemble learning has been extensively studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing ensemble clustering methods are based on knowledge bases ( kbs ) , which can be categorized into three categories : ( 1 ) kernel based methods , ( 2 ) <unk> @cite , ( 3 ) <unk> @cite @cite , and ensemble methods @cite @cite . k-means is the most popular method to reduce the number of partitions in a high-dimensional space. however , it is difficult to find the optimal partitions for each group , and is thus hard to implement in practice. to overcome this limitation , some researchers have proposed ensemble methods , such as co-association @cite , which aims to maximize the probability of each landmark in a single cluster @cite .
- graph diversity is a hot topic in recent years due to the development of graph representation and diversity preservation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , graph representation has been widely utilized in graph diversity , such as mutual information @cite , kernighan @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use ensemble methods to cluster objects and links in the graph to improve the performance of graph clustering. however , these methods are not designed for diversified clusters , which are hard to implement in practice. to overcome this limitation , the above methods are designed to be suitable to other types of data .
- the consensus problem has been extensively studied in the context of graph analytics @cite @cite @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite @cite . most of the existing work focuses on the bayesian consensus problem in probabilistic settings , where the objective is to minimize the total number of projections on the graph , while the objective function is to maximize the number of clusters in the graph @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the multi-level consensus validating the clusterings and the coupled subspaces are available in subspace-based ; see , e.g. , @cite @cite and references therein. moreover , we compare our proposed method with these studies .
- vgg net @cite is a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) that has been widely used in recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite @cite @cite , and has been shown to be a powerful tool for artificial neural networks @cite @cite . vgg @cite , a gating network ( <unk> ) @cite , which uses stiefel wavelets as inputs to recurrent units. <unk> @cite uses stiefel manifold structures to capture the norms of norms , while <unk> @cite introduces stiefel manifold constraints to enforce orthogonality constraints. <unk> @cite emerges as an alternative , but does not address the issue of gradient vanishing or exploding gradients , and it is unclear whether stiefel manifold assumptions. however , these studies focus on static or dynamic textures .
- batch normalization ( bn ) has been proven to be effective in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite , image recognition @cite , and image generation @cite . batch normalization @cite is a widely used technique to improve the performance of neural networks. it has been shown that batch normalization can be applied to a wide range of learning tasks , such as mnist and cifar-10. we demonstrate in section that our method is able to benefit from the recent progress of deep neural network architectures , and demonstrate that it can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in the literature @cite . batch normalization has shown decent performance in practice. however , in practice , it is not easy to see whether the image is a flat and flat .
- batch normalization ( bn ) has been proven to be effective in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , image super-resolution @cite , and life-long learning @cite . vgg @cite is the first attempt to address the problem of optimizing batch normalization , where @math is the training set , and @math denotes the number of samples in @math . batch normalization @cite is a technique that balances batch normalization and batch normalization into two separate layers , namely @math , @math and @math . each of these coefficients can be represented by @math , and as @math , where the @math is a regularization parameter .
- there is a large body of work on the perturbation of lyapunov methods @cite @cite @cite . for example , the parameter @math is defined as @math where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . the @math calculus is based on a manifold @math , where @math denotes the number of points in @math . the definition of the @math is given by @math , and @math is an appropriately defined normed space and @math . in the case when @math is finite , it is easy to see that @math is a constant , i.e. , @math . the parameter perturbation @math can be computed via a product of @math and the largest singular value decomposition ( svd ) @cite @cite .
- there is a large body of work on detecting saddle points in hyperbolic spaces. for example , @cite defines the inner product of two terms : @math , @math , and @math , where @math and @math are the number of first-order dynamics , and the metric of the first-order dynamics @cite @cite @cite . in the present work , we are aware of prior work on augmented bundle adjustment @cite @cite . in the former , we assume that @math is a manifold and @math is assumed to have hyperbolic displacement , and that there exists a manifold @math such that @math . the latter induces an @math submanifold of @math , which can be seen as a generalization of locally optimal first-order dynamics in hyperbolic space @cite .
- there is a large body of work on detecting mobile objects in a query @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an object detector that is based on the maximum pose of the query , and a humanoid manipulator that can be executed by the robot , while in @cite the authors introduce the concept of a humanoid robot that can twist and planning. however , they do not address the problem of detecting repeated objects and their orientations are not considered in this paper. in contrast to these works , our fixed-base system is able to decide whether the manipulator is repositioning or not , while the robots are not playing an autonomous robot .
- finding potential locations in different environments has been investigated in the context effector task @cite and mobile manipulators @cite . however , these works do not address placement and manipulation of the task , which is the case for mobile robots. moreover , they assume that the task is to be placed in the database , whereas our goal is to minimize the degrees of freedom in the task at which a robot has to be able to execute in a single plan and as in our case , it is possible to use a robot as a controller. in contrast , our approach does not require a robot to execute on a robot .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved that maximum manipulation can be used to achieve dexterity ' ' . in this paper , we extend the idea of maximum reachability analysis to maximum sections of the robot ' s state , and introduce a library that allows robots to decide what ' s next state will be reachable from the front of the task ' s task , which allows one to commit to the task at which the task will be executed. however , in our case , the task is more complex and it can be easily integrated into the robot placement and dexterity ' s plan .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of object summarisation in a video sequence. for example , @cite use a cnn to extract features from a video stream and feed them into a cnn for object summarisation , followed by a user ' s tags and then use a rnn to predict the next video frame to classify the video clips and classify the clips in the video sequence. however , this approach is not applicable for sport video summarisation , as it requires a large number of frames per frame per frame , and does not provide any information about the content provider ' s actions .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use twitter data as a source of information for the detection of emotions in a video sequence. in their work , the network is trained on a set of predefined visual features , such as color , size and size of the image. in contrast to our work , they focus on the quality of players in a single scene , while we focus on highlights the subtle differences between spectators and their usage on the content of the smartphone , while our work is different from theirs in that we do not focus solely on the motion and the motion of the video , which is the focus of this paper .
- our work is also related to the task of sport attention @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of visual information to guide the extraction of the excitement for the forward- and <unk> in addition , we also use the tv-like network @cite as a benchmark for this purpose . in contrast to @cite , we use a tv-like network to detect audience actions in the sport , which is also the focus of this paper. in contrast , we do not focus on detecting the excitement of actions in sport editing , rather than manually defined actions , instead of enumerating actions .
- highlight the importance of audience highlights in sport editing , which is the focus of this paper , in which players decide what to look at the next pitch of the video , and to predict the excitement for looking at the highlights in the soccer team @cite . in this paper we propose a reverse game paradigm that is similar to @cite , where they use a convolutional network to extract features from the video and to extract feature representations from the sport , and use a new tv-like architecture for detecting audience excitement for the sports. however , as a result , we need not only a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) , but also to learn the mapping from the audio domain to the sport .
- this work is also related to the problem of locating crowd players in sport environments @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use more social dynamics to detect teams of crowd players , and to automatically detect motions using a hmm. however , they focus on detecting teams of motions which are relevant to our work. in contrast , our work focuses on detecting highlights differences between crowd behavior and framing the problem to the task of excitement for fan theories. it is unclear how this affects the pitch of the game , im , and anderson conducted an experimental study on fan users .
- increasing the security and privacy of human devices has been a subject of intensive research in recent years. it has been extensively studied in the context of human activity recognition @cite @cite @cite , and has been used to increase user engagement @cite @cite . however , most of these studies are focused on voice commands and do not take into account hand movement and finger movement , which is the focus of our study. as a matter of fact , a large body of work has been done on human activity understanding , hand , keystroke and keystroke @cite . however , the primary focus of this paper is solely on human body and action recognition .
- in recent years , there has been a number of studies on the motion analysis of human ' s ' s motion @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors demonstrated that keystroke information can be used as a <unk> signal to infer and infer the next user ' s activity. in @cite and @cite , a smartwatch sensor is used to localize the next person ' s position. @cite , @cite , and @cite have shown that keystroke data can be exploited in the form of keystroke information , and even in the presence of a smartwatch ' s clear <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .

- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of network sizes in acoustic systems and propose the use of 65 for example , in order to understand the sizes of a given neuron , a network can be used to determine if it has a small number of wanted clusters of interest ( namely , @math ) . in contrast , our work focuses on the detection and detection of clusters in the presence of faulty components. in addition , our focus is on audio processing , rather than supercomputers , and does not provide a complete view on a safe set of clusters ( i.e. , 1000 ) .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite . they train a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the next audio event given a query image and a feature vector , which consists of a cnn followed by a feature extractor followed by feature extraction and classification. they train their network on a dataset of 100 million audio clips and train their model on mnist and cifar-10 datasets and show that it is better at the same time as the one presented in @cite . in this paper , we use a 4-layer fully convolutional network ( cnn ) for the task of content-based event detection .

- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on increasing the performance of 3g cellular networks @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of tcp on the analysis of the incentives of randomly deployed clients on the days of the years. in contrast , our work focuses on the design of mobile converter , and does not consider the effect of inter-cell interference. in addition , we focus on the impact on routing performance in cellular networks in the context of 3g connections and lte on the reliability of the routing problem. moreover , we do not consider offloading in the collection of diverse clients .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular methods for generative generative modeling @cite @cite . gans have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , including text-to-image synthesis @cite @cite @cite , image generation @cite @cite and so on. gans have also been used to generate scenes and scenes @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data to train and test data , which is hard to train in situations where the data is multimodal. in a similar vein , @cite proposed to train a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for image generation .
- a number of studies have investigated the effect of the capability of automatically predicting the properties of the organization ( e.g. , the degree of gaze , pitch , etc. ) in the context of the conversation. for example , @cite proposed a model to predict the turn-taking of the turn-taking threshold and showed that the value of a contour can be removed from the training set. @cite developed a model that predicts the parameters of a turn-taking contour ( <unk> ) based on the turn-taking network ( <unk> ) model @cite . in this paper , we focus on the multimodal neural transition model , which is the focus of this paper .
- the use of implicit cues for human-robot interaction has been explored in the context of human-robot interaction @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a combination of implicit behavior cues and nonverbal behaviors , such as human-human interactions. the turn-taking process was used in @cite to predict the turn-taking of an implicit turn-taking task , which was shown to be effective. in this work , we use implicit cues , which allows the robot to learn the turn-taking policy , where the turn-taking model was proposed in @cite . master-slave architecture was used as a mechanism for modeling the turn-taking channel and nonverbal behavior of the game .
- there has been a large amount of work on sentence embeddings for sentence embeddings @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are designed for english and french speakers , which are not suitable for our task as they do not have access to sentences or sentences in a sentence vector , and are not truly effective. for example , the authors of @cite proposed a method that is trained on a large dataset of german words from wikipedia and used it as a pretraining step for language model training and fine-tuning on a dataset. they showed that their method outperformed the baseline on the <unk> dataset .
- the constructions of mds codes are based on the constructions presented in @cite and @cite . in @cite , the constructions are extended to reduce the sub-packetization levels. bandwidth-efficient alignment in @cite is studied for the sub-packetization level , where @math is the sub-packetization of the erasures , and @math is a fundamental concern for the mds process. bandwidth-efficient mds codes in @cite are also studied in @cite @cite , where the eavesdroppers or <unk> codes are used in @cite to reduce this gap by ensuring that the sub-packetization is at least one of the fundamental constructions in @cite . bandwidth-efficient codes that arise from this paper can be regarded as a special case of this paper .
- in this section , we briefly review the related work on reducing the sub-packetization level decoding. for instance , the work @cite is the first to propose a framework that is based on the sub-packetization levels. in @cite , the authors present the first constructions for scalar mds codes and elliptic mds codes that are evenodd mds codes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite @cite @cite . the third category of codes is that the sub-packetization of the mds mds mds construction is elliptic , and there is no guarantee on the <unk> mds construction of the <unk> mds construction that treats all nodes in the system equally , while in @cite the repair nodes approaching the same sub-packetization levels. however , in @cite @cite the authors use a <unk> coding scheme to recover the sub-packetization levels .

- the most relevant work to ours is @cite . they use a deep neural network ( cnn ) to classify objects in the image. they use the maximum a-posteriori map ( ) as the input to a classifier. they use this information as input for a subsequent classification task , and use it as a feature extractor for multi-label classification. however , their method is not suitable for multi-label object classification task since they are not applicable to multi-label problems as we do in this paper. instead of using a cnn instead of just one pixel in the image , we use a cnn as input to feed it into their network to improve the classification accuracy .
- resource management is a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works focus on data processing and control tasks , such as resource management @cite @cite , resource allocation @cite , etc. to the best of our knowledge , there is no work on access management and management of resource provisioning. there are some notable works that aim to protect multiple tasks and monitor the trade-off between execution time and execution time @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an approach to reduce the number of tasks and reduce the computation time and throughput by copying tasks from the source code , and propose a user-level gpu approach to dynamically allocate resources across tasks on gpu applications .
- <unk> @cite is the first approach to address the performance of closed-source systems , offering a real-time framework for multi-gpu embedded systems. the main idea is to use closed-source systems to achieve real-time performance on a single system. the main drawback of these systems is that they do not take into account of the dependencies between tasks and tasks , hence , do not address task performance issues on gpu hardware. for example , <unk> @cite is a gpu for real-time treating gpus as two-level <unk> @cite , which provides real-time efficiencies and real-time workloads. however , all of these methods require specialized hardware accelerator or software components. in contrast , our dsl is designed for real-time case , and does not support real-time computation .
- a number of recent papers have investigated schedulability for single- and reconfigurable systems @cite @cite @cite . these works focus on the response of a single gpu and do not consider time synchronization , which is the focus of our server-based task analysis for reconfigurable system tasks , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , for instance , ibm tr , and ibm tr " a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which aims at reducing performance degradation of <unk> <unk> in contrast , our work focuses on phase transition and does not focus on <unk> .
- the blackbox of the ml algorithm is huge , since the internals of the systems are usually independent of the data , which is usually reflected by a dnn model @cite @cite @cite . the blackbox cpu pipeline is used in the case of systems @cite . as a result , it is widely used in many platforms , such as the <unk> @cite , the <unk> @cite , or the <unk> @cite , is the basis for the case-study group , which aims at finding a safe set of units that can be processed by an online scheduler , or by dynamically identifying a set of features .
- reducing the number of points for voxel alignment has been a topic of active research @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an iterative closest point method based on iterative closest k-d trees ( <unk> ) , which is based on the principal component analysis ( pca ) @cite . in @cite @cite , iterative closest points are used to estimate the shape of the point cloud , where the point is the signed distance function ( tsdf ) . in @cite the authors define the modularity function as a function of the point-to-point graph , and then use it to register the two submaps .
- in @cite , the authors present a method that is able to match two points of a voxel grid. the method is based on a set of points of size @math , where @math is the signed distance between two points in the map and @math is a function of the voxel grid. in this method , each voxel is represented by a voxel grid , and the index is constructed from a set of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on bootstrapping of rigid body parts @cite @cite @cite . these methods are based on the assumption that the shape of the object is known to be textured , i.e. , the surface normal , or the angle of the surface. however , there is no guarantee for the completeness of the voxel plane , which is hard to approximate for the rest. as an example , <unk> and <unk> @cite have proposed a method to register pairs using color matching and surface normal matching , but they do not provide any guarantee on the viewpoint of a voxel grid. however , they are not suitable for general environments .
- there is a large body of work on automated registration of 3d scans for medical scans @cite @cite @cite . for example , the work of @cite is the first to propose a 3d registration method for registering ct scans to a 2d voxel grid. the work in @cite uses a 3d voxel grid as a grid of voxels. in @cite , the method is used to divide the scans into two groups , namely , and . in contrast to @cite @cite , our method is based on exact assumptions of voxel dispersion , and is more general than our method since we are interested in exact registration .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method that is based on the idea of aligning two points of the same voxel , and convolving two two different subspaces of the true ones with the true codewords. they use a circular marker on a plane , and apply it to all clouds of the shapes. this method is able to compute the codewords of being close to each other , but it is not suitable for the comparison of two points in the voxel grid. in contrast to our method , our method is more general since it does not require any a-priori knowledge of the point clouds .
- word embeddings have also been used for word embeddings @cite . however , they do not use any word embeddings for the embedding of the words in a multilingual corpus and do not encode any information about the word embeddings. in contrast to our work , this paper focuses on the use of encoded word embeddings and applies it to the word embeddings of a word vector , which is a key component in our case , such as word2vec @cite . in this paper , we propose a new model that is trained on a corpus of word embeddings from a corpus and given it as input .
- there has been a large body of work on injecting semantic information into word embeddings @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite uses conceptnet @cite to encode relations between words and relations into a graph , and @cite uses a graph representation to capture the semantic valuable. however , these methods are only applicable to our task as they do not require any word embeddings to represent the given relation. furthermore , our method is more flexible and easier to implement and does not require the word embeddings of words and their contexts are quite different from our proposed method , which is a generalization of the framework proposed by @cite .
- commonsense knowledge acquisition has been explored in the context of commonsense knowledge base completion @cite . however , this is not the first attempt to address this issue , as it does not require any knowledge about the semantics of a word or a word , which requires a wikipedia entity to be retrieved from a wikipedia cluster. moreover , there is a need to be manually annotated for the word embeddings , such as the one proposed by @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not attempt to learn embedding embeddings in a multilingual manner , and use it to encode the knowledge of the knowledge encoded in our knowledge .
- the use of neural networks for image registration is inspired by the work of <unk> al @cite . they use a cnn to extract features from the intensity volume , and then use a 3d cnn to predict the quality of the image. <unk> al @cite use cnns for image segmentation. <unk> al @cite apply cnns to 3d image segmentation , and use 3d convolutions for voxelized 3d image alignment. <unk> al @cite perform a 2d image super-resolution network on a 3d voxel grid , which is used for image super-resolution and segmentation. the network is trained in an end-to-end manner , and is trained on the hierarchical dmm in @cite .
- <unk> al @cite present a method for registration of 3d fet al <unk> al ' s 2d image patches from 2d images superimposed onto a 3d surface. this method is trained on rgb images , and it is trained to predict the fet al pose from rgb images. this method can be used as a baseline for comparison to other methods , such as <unk> al @cite , and <unk> al @cite . in contrast , our network is trained with a 3d cnn trained on 2d images and is trained jointly with a 2d cnn trained with 3d poses. we compare our method with the state-of-the-art methods , and show the advantages of <unk> and <unk> .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a method based on drr , where the image is represented as a set of discrete data points , and then used it to construct a volumetric feature space. <unk> al @cite presented a method for craniofacial growth , which can be used for fast search. however , these methods require large amounts of training data , making it difficult to train and test data intensive , making them unsuitable for real-world robotic applications due to the lack of domain knowledge. moreover , they require a large amount of data for training data and test samples for training samples , which limits their application in complex environments .
- there is a large body of work on reconstruction and registration of 2d images @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for reconstruction pipelines. for example , in @cite , the svr is used for reconstruction of 2d intensity values , while in @cite the authors used slice-to-volume registration to estimate the deformation volume of the fet al precludes the application to 3d reconstruction of 3d fet al ultrasound and <unk> al @cite used slice-to-volume drr to simulate mri scatters from 2d images , and then used a 3d interpreter for registration between 3d and fet al @cite . in contrast , we focus on the reconstruction volume rather than geometry , which is the focus of this paper .
- the work most closely related to ours is posenet @cite , which uses a deep convolutional neural network to predict the pose of a fet al fet al @cite , where they regress the pose from a set of rgb images from a 2d image , followed by a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite to operate on a 3d fet al point cloud and regress from the intensity of pixels. however , these methods are not directly applicable to our task as we do in this paper , we focus on the use of a cnn architecture for fet al pose estimation. we compare our method with these methods in sec. .
- canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) @cite is one of the most popular methods for image registration , which is based on the fact that it can be used to estimate the fet al fet al ' s fet al model and <unk> al @cite proposed a method for image classification and segmentation. this method is used as a preprocessing step for image denoising and segmentation. in contrast , our method does not require any prior knowledge about the underlying fet al spatial dimensions , but instead relies on the use of canonical one-layer hmm. nevertheless , the <unk> approach is still outperformed by <unk> al @cite .
- in the context of scheduling , there has been a number of studies on scheduling games ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein ) . for instance , in @cite , the authors studied the problem of scheduling jobs in a scheduling setting , where the goal is to minimize the total number of machines and the creation of a machine learning unit. in @cite the authors introduced the notion of , which is , in contrast to our work , they considered the case of jobs in which the machines are capacitated , and they assumed that all machines are allowed to have the same amount of delay in the social welfare .
- there is a large body of work on scheduling in games , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. in particular , in @cite , the authors consider the social welfare problem in parallel , and show that it is possible to achieve the optimal quality of the pareto-optimal solution. in @cite the authors show that the social network can be assigned to a constant factor @math , where @math is the number of machines , and @math is a constant , and the time is bounded by a constant factor. in this paper , we show that there exists a @math time algorithm ( which is @math -hard ) , and a @math -approximation algorithm in @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the relation between character embeddings and word embeddings @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite use character-level convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to learn word embeddings which are then fed into a cnn to predict the next pos tag in order to improve model performance. @cite use a recurrent neural network network ( rnn ) for word embeddings , which is trained for language modeling tasks. @cite use recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) to model the character-level and contextualized words in a word-level fashion , for example by using character-level cnns. @cite propose a neural network for lstm and language modeling .
- image descriptors have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image pattern recognition @cite , image retrieval @cite , and image retrieval. for example , local binary features ( lbp ) @cite are used for image classification. lbp is used to extract image features from the raw image , which are extracted from the image , and then fed into a binary classifier to classify the images @cite @cite . local features are extracted using local features , such as ltp @cite is a biomedical image retrieval system that uses local features extracted from local descriptors. however , it is not suitable for image retrieval .
- in this paper , we use a similar approach to @cite , where the authors use a egomotion data to estimate the object ' s motion of a 2d image , and then use it to predict the label of an image. we use this approach as a baseline for response compression , and show that it performs better in terms of the number of frames per frame , while in our case we do not impose any restriction on the size of the data , which is the case in this paper. in addition to the use of egomotion data , our representation is able to capture the temporal dependencies appropriately. furthermore , we have used this approach to learn the features from a 2d cnn , and use it as features as features in our model .
- monocular depth estimation has been a hot topic in recent years due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) based methods @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an image compression method based on conditional random field ( crf ) for monocular depth prediction. the work in @cite uses conditional random fields to predict the next time frame. in @cite a cnn is used for image super-resolution and depth estimation. the work of @cite proposes an unsupervised filter extraction task , which consists of a cnn and a cnn followed by an encoder and a decoder that predicts the surface of the scene from a single image. however , this method requires a large amount of training data to be available .
- there is a large body of work on localization of moving objects using a cnn @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of training data to be available for training. moreover , they do not require the availability of ground truth data for training. in contrast , our method is able to estimate the pose of a scene with a variety of variability. this is due to the fact that it can be used for localization in a cnn as in @cite . in contrast to these methods , we use a cnn to predict the pose and shape of an object , which is not necessary for localization .
- the use of a cnn for machine translation has been explored in the context of neural machine translation @cite @cite . however , this is not suitable for our implementation because it does not require any retraining for the vocabulary. moreover , we use a larger number of parameters for the cnn model and use it to improve the performance of the deep cnn model in order to achieve better performance in terms of the number of parameters. moreover , our model does not rely on an increasing number of gradients during the training phase and does not use any information about the vocabulary. we compare our model with these previous works .
- the deterministic rendezvous problem has been studied extensively in the context of graphs. for example , @cite showed that the rendezvous problem can be strongly strongly np-hard , and showed that deterministic rendezvous of the agents can achieve high probability than @math . however , they also showed that there is a constant factor of @math . moreover , they used a randomized algorithm that can rendezvous in the worst case , where @math is the number of agents in the time of the algorithm and the time is @math . in contrast to our work , they showed that rendezvous of a constant factor. moreover , their result is nonconstructive and relies on the adversary .
- memory required for the ring to achieve deterministic rendezvous was studied in @cite . memory needed for randomized rendezvous was considered in @cite . however , the rendezvous problem was not considered in the context of faulty agents and the agents were assumed to have high expected rounds. moreover , memory needed in @cite allowed for trees to achieve a constant expected , and a rendezvous tree of the ring is used for security. moreover , in @cite , and @cite , the finite number of agents was assumed to be fixed and , and the rendezvous requirement is relaxed to ensure deterministic rendezvous in the agents .
- there is a large body of work on gathering the speed of agents in the plane @cite @cite @cite . however , there is no need for the coordination of the agents , which is not always feasible in general @cite @cite . in the context of autonomous agents , it is important to note that in the sense that all agents have access to each other , and that is , if they are not allowed , then the agent can be <unk> in contrast to our work , we do not assume the presence of faulty agents and or faulty obstacles , and therefore do not impose any notion of performance .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a personalized ranking approach based on matrix factorization ( <unk> ) , which uses matrix factorization to predict the trend of identifying relevant items in the knowledge base , and then trains a matrix factorization model to predict future recommendations. however , this approach does not scale well in the domain of social media and does not address the problem of personalized ranking , as we do in this paper. instead , instead , we assume that we are interested in knowing if a pool of items has a high probability , while in our case there is no confusion between the source and target domains .
- in the context of collaborative filtering , the authors proposed a method to recommend items based on their interests and prominence of tweets and tweets , based on the content of the user. their method is similar to ours , but differs from our approach in that they do not require any other entity catalog , which is also problematic for changes in the documents , as it is source-code centric or <unk> moreover , we do not consider a more general approach to the problem of online recommendation , as we saw in the experimental results presented in this paper. the main difference is that our proposed method is based on a question feature vector , rather than a set of items that are relevant to each other .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications ranging from natural language processing ( nlp ) @cite @cite @cite to forums @cite @cite , dialogue systems @cite , and elsewhere @cite @cite . there has also been a number of initiatives to build the sentiment lexicons based on word embeddings , such as headline generation @cite , polarity analysis @cite , word embeddings @cite and slangsd @cite . however , most of these approaches are based on the linguistic entries of the word embeddings extracted from the social word and text , which are difficult to scale to large datasets .
- sequence labeling has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods rely on handcrafted features such as capitalization , word length , word count , and syntactic features. these features are then used to improve the performance of sequence classification. for example , @cite use conditional random fields ( crf ) to classify the named entity and the word and the named word. @cite use crf to predict words and sentiments of the word , followed by a crf classifier for named entity recognition , and achieved state-of-the-art results on the 2016 dataset .
- the task of relation extraction. there has been a lot of recent work on distributed word embeddings @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to learn word embeddings for the 2016 dataset. @cite use recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) to extract word embeddings and classify each word as a sequence of words and their corresponding words. @cite use an iterative inference algorithm , where word embeddings are used as input to the relation ht task , followed by a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier to classify the words in a sentence and the corresponding word is subjected to a softmax classifier. similarly to @cite @cite , we use a similar approach to @cite .
- in this paper , we focus on the related work on the style of the style transformation , which is the case of a mobile robot @cite @cite . in contrast to our methods , the style is wholly replaced by a single feed-forward neural network , and in our case , in which we do not have access to all other objects of interest ( such as the style or style ) . in contrast , in @cite , mxnet and <unk> provide an efficient implementation of meta learning with meta learning by removing edges from the 1.5 seconds to ensure that they do not provide any information about the depth of the network .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on style transfer @cite , which aims to transfer knowledge from one domain to another domain. in this paper , we propose a novel meta network architecture that is trained on another domain of imagenet @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not require any retraining or retraining for the network , which is not the case for a new task , as we will show in our experiments , the results of @cite are not comparable to the one presented in this paper. we hypothesize that the problem of style transformation is that the style of the style is not taken into account , but also the fact that the parameters of the network are trained on a new dataset .
- this work is also related to the imagenet challenge @cite . it has been shown that initializing the expected number of instances in the imagenet dataset @cite can be used to evaluate the performance of deep neural networks. however , it is not surprising that this dataset has a large number of layers in a neural network ( fnn ) . in contrast to this work , we focus on initializing the weights with the weights of a pre-trained network , which is a more challenging task than training data in this paper , we also use a new network as a black box for our experiments .
- @cite proposed a method to infer the label of the data in the training set and test it to predict the label for a given group of instances , which is then used as a training set for the classifier. they used a similar approach to ours , but they assumed that the instances in the test set are close to each other , and they didn ' t have any label information. however , their method did not consider cleaning up such distributions , as we do in this paper . in contrast to our work , we use neural network as a baseline for deep neural network models .
- in this paper , we propose a novel deep learning model that is able to predict the demographics of the instances in the training set , which is a generalization of deep neural network models trained on imagenet , and fine-tuned on the <unk> dataset @cite . in contrast to these previous works , we focus on the pseudo label distributions , which are not directly applicable to our setting , as we do in this work , we introduce a new pseudo label network ( <unk> ) that predicts the distributions of the labels of the training data , while in @cite , we use an ensemble of regional models to train our models .
- batch normalization ( bn ) has been proven to be effective in many applications including speech recognition @cite @cite , image classification @cite , and image generation @cite . batch normalization @cite is the first to propose an ensemble of deep neural networks ( dnns ) for the classification task , where the instances of the data are encouraged to be close to each other , and has been shown to be useful for regularization in neural network architectures @cite . our work is also related to recent work on neural access to neural networks @cite @cite @cite . our work differs in that we use batch normalization , which is the focus of our work .
- recently , there has been a lot of interest in using deep neural networks for attribute estimation @cite @cite @cite . for example , hyperface @cite uses deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to learn pose invariant features for each action , and uses it to predict the subtle differences between instances in the training set , which is a subset of instances in a deep neural network trained on a large dataset , and it is trained to predict a class label for the attribute class , and then predicts the label label for each class based on its classification score , and a binary classification score for each class. <unk> @cite uses a co-training based cnn and a combination of deep features and deep features for attribute classification , achieving state-of-the-art results on the <unk> dataset .
- co-training @cite is a seminal work on deep learning in deep learning. it aims to find tasks that are relevant to each other in a training set , and that can be used to predict the human partner. interestingly , co-training @cite can provide a framework for deep attribute classification , where the bags of bags are positive and negative if they belong to the same class ( i.e. , if it contains a positive or negative class ) , and the corresponding classifiers are trained in a minimax manner to produce a description of the training set in a semi-supervised manner ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) .
- bias estimation has been extensively studied in the context of vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , a distance metric was used to estimate the orientation of rhythmic and <unk> error , which were used to determine the objectivity of the bias of skill levels. in this paper , we focus on the use of athlete , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> proposed an algorithm for assigning skill scores to skill levels and skill levels in an adult sequence. in contrast , our proposed representation is based on athlete ' ' . in contrast to @cite , our system uses a convolutional network ( cnn ) to predict motions and pose from source video .
- the detection of nids is a hot topic in recent years due to the rise of nids ' s call , which can be traced back to intrusions. nowadays , the authors of @cite use a finite state machine ( lstm ) to model the system call sequences , and then use it to predict the next call for the next layer. similarly , in @cite , they use the term frequency ( <unk> ) as a feature extractor and show that it is possible to predict model call sequences ( <unk> ) . in this work , we use this approach in this paper as a baseline for malware detection .
- there is a large body of work on detecting malware infections such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . the main difference between these work and ours is that they do not use any information about the behaviors of the malware , while we focus on the detection of anomalies in the context of intrusions. nowadays , we are interested in finding clusters that are not semantically similar. we believe that our approach is more general than theirs , as we saw in our experimental results show in section .
- malware detection has been a hot research topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the detection of malicious events , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on building rules that are specific to the malicious windows. in particular , we are not aware of any work that has been done on behavioral features that are relevant to our work. in @cite , the authors developed a system based on api calls and domain knowledge , which is used to identify the malware that is most similar to ours .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which considers the problem of inverting a sequence of actions to infer the goals of a given observations. the work in @cite is the closest to ours , however , they do not consider the case where the goal is to determine whether an adult domain should be present , and do not address the issue of malware change. in contrast , our work focuses on detecting malware properties and does not consider any a-priori knowledge about the domain , which is the focus of our work . however , in the context of malware analysis , the authors do not provide any guarantee of any uncertainty in the environment. moreover , they assume that all actions are treated independently , while they are not explicitly modeled explicitly , they are assumed to be available and cannot be captured by other domains .
- in the context of interdependent networks , there has been a surge of interest in the literature on system percolation , see , e.g. , @cite @cite and references therein. the reason for these investigations is that the discretization of the network is interdependent , and the failures of the sub-network should be treated as a sum of failures at each timestep as in our case. the reason why we are interested in the present work is that we do not assume the existence of a <unk> lattice , and we use it to derive our results in this paper , as we saw in the introduction .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to detect household activities based on the object transduction problem. they used the object detection method to localize the objects in the image. they proposed a neural network that detects household activities by detecting household objects , which is trained using the object detectors and descriptors. however , they did not consider any information about objects in an image. in their work , they assumed that there is a large number of instances in the image , which could be a large gap compared to the object categories. in our work , instead of using skin color information , we used a neural neural network to learn a hand model for skin proposal .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a hand convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for video classification. they used a cnn to extract features from rgb images and extract features for distinguish people from genuine and <unk> , which are extracted from the video , and then fed it to a two-stream cnn to classify each video frame in a cluster based on a regression model. the two-stream architecture is trained on rgb images , which consists of 16 hours and 1,000 fps , respectively , followed by 4 to 30 seconds , 5 fps , and 10 ms , respectively. the dataset consisted of a large number of thousands of hours and 27
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to investigate extremal properties of bipartite graphs. they showed that the maximum likelihood of a cell can be used to determine if it is not possible to determine whether or not it had to be completed or not. however , they found that in the case of @math , the maximum proportion of rows tends to be at most @math . in contrast , our <unk> is based on the fact that we are interested in the number of rectangles in the latin @math , where @math is the dilation rate .
- our work is also closely related to the boinc project @cite , which is the closest to ours in terms of sudoku and <unk> @cite . they use a <unk> algorithm to check for sudoku , but use a <unk> algorithm for counting sudoku , which relies on a <unk> <unk> algorithm @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not use <unk> , but instead use <unk> <unk> , <unk> uses <unk> , and <unk> use <unk> force-directed <unk> for enumerating all possible <unk> <unk> in contrast , we use <unk> , which uses <unk> and <unk> , as we do in this work .
- a number of axiomatic models have been proposed to capture the geometrical aspects of the generative model @cite @cite @cite . in particular , a mirror descent method was proposed to train a neural network for computing the probability of a kullback-leibler divergence @cite . in this paper , we focus on the accelerated learning of mirror descent algorithms in the context of reinforcement learning methods , which we refer the interested reader to @cite for a detailed presentation of the related work . a similar approach was presented by fang and <unk> , who also used a similar technique to <unk> and dually alpha-divergences divergence measures .
- there has been a lot of work on policy search @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not address the problem of premature convergence in the optimization process. in contrast to our work , we propose an algorithm based on a gating mechanism based on local gradients , which is a key component of our algorithm. in contrast , our algorithm is based on the policy gradient method @cite , which searches the optimal policy by solving a non-linear optimization problem. moreover , we use a3c as a black box algorithm for policy search and show that it performs better than other methods such as <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite .
- reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been a topic of active research in recent years @cite @cite @cite . reinforcement learning , such as q-learning @cite , trpo @cite , and reinforcement learning @cite , has become increasingly popular due to the fact that the learned policy is a good choice for the task of finding the optimal solution of the curse of dimensionality , and has become a standard approach for derandomization tasks , see , for example , @cite and references therein. the cma-es , which updates the covariance matrix of the matrix and then updates the policy by maximizing the covariance of the largest and largest singular values of the original stochastic gradient ( ppo ) @cite .
- stochastic stochastic search ( mds ) is a classic problem in rl @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that rl can be applied to a wide range of tasks , including rl @cite , path planning @cite , stochastic gradient descent @cite , and so on. however , these methods require a large number of iterations and are susceptible to outliers @cite . therefore , it is difficult to train due to the high computational complexity and high computational cost , making this approach difficult to apply to rl problems @cite . in this paper , we propose to use nesterov ' s method for rl .
- there is a large body of work on generating convex processes based on gaussian bisection @cite @cite @cite , guided gradient descent @cite , and guided accelerated proximal gradient @cite methods @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to the case when the black points are close to each other , and they are not applicable to our setting , which is the case of gaussian norm minimization , as in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an accelerated version of a mahalanobis guided gradient method based on a simplex algorithm , and show that it is possible to solve the convex optimization problem .

- the most relevant work to ours is alloy @cite , which is a generalization of alloy , a <unk> for image annotation. the idea is to embed the data into crowds for a given query. the examples are clustered into categories , such as alloy @cite and <unk> @cite . however , as we are aware of , ford and <unk> are not <unk> interestingly , ford proposed a <unk> <unk> algorithm , a <unk> , and a <unk> algorithm @cite to classify the items into categories based on the content and the content of the canvas. thus on the total of items on the source and target views , they can be used as input for a test set .
- our work is inspired by the recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite @cite . attention indices have been successfully applied to semantic segmentation @cite , image recognition @cite , scene classification @cite , and image captioning @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on multi-scale features that are jointly trained on road images to facilitate multi-scale feature fusion and achieve better performance than previous methods . our approach is different from @cite in that we propose a novel attention mechanism to fuse the features from the encoder and decoder to improve the performance of the segmentation network , which is more robust to subtle changes in the decoder .
- in this paper , we propose a novel attention-based network for hot targets abbreviation recognition in the context of hot targets , namely , in which the attention is influenced by the character of each other in the image. in contrast to @cite , our method is more general and easier to train in a more general way than just imitating the constraints on the attention mechanism. moreover , in @cite , the authors propose an end-to-end network that is able to predict the correct attention of a character in a sentence and to improve the performance of the target attention mechanism in a conditional random field .
- there is a large body of work on kg embedding @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on neural network models @cite @cite , which have been shown to be very effective. for example , sfe @cite uses random walks to generate the missing relation for a given set of relations , and then uses a random walk on top of the left and right word to draw the path. sfe @cite is a tensor factorization model that generates the word embeddings of the entities , and merges them together with word embeddings for the next word in the knowledge graph , and uses it as input to feed the entity embeddings into a tensor .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision and natural language processing. it has been widely studied in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing approaches are based on deep learning based approaches , such as image classification @cite @cite , image retrieval @cite @cite and image captioning @cite @cite . the most relevant work to ours is the bpr @cite , which aims at finding a ranking between the source and the target and target and the corresponding embedding of the target domain to the target domain. however , there is no work that uses neural networks to predict the target label for the target kg. our work differs in that it aims at generating the target graph , rather than using the visual content itself. instead , our work focuses on multi-relational learning and mid-level relations jointly .
- this work is also related to the task of relationship prediction and relationship prediction @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a probabilistic learning framework to optimize the relation between predicted and unseen classes. the proposed method is different from ours in that it aims to learn a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that is trained to predict the objects of interest in a given kg. our method is similar in spirit to @cite and @cite . however , instead of using hand-crafted features , we use first-class word embeddings to represent the entities of the text , and use first-class support vector machine ( svm ) to encode the objects into a latent space .
- depression prediction has been studied extensively in the context of social media @cite @cite @cite . there are many studies that have examined the 2016 brexit referendum. they found that there is a large body of work that has been done in the domain of health @cite . in particular , twitter has been used as a source of trust in va environments @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of social signals to detect users as well as the statistical relationships between users and their statistical properties , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and anomaly-based <unk> systems ( idss ) .

- our work is also related to the recent work on density map detectors @cite @cite @cite . however , the main difference is that our method does not require any annotation of the objects , nor does it need to train a model for the density map. in contrast , our method is able to count the objects of interest and surveillance scenes , and does not rely on deep neural networks to estimate the density of each plant , which is not suitable for our counting scenario , as we saw in the experiment results show in section 4 . the differences between these methods and ours are that they are not applicable to our setting .
- there is a large body of work on model counting in the presence of rosette trees @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to our setting , as they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the plants of the plant , which is the case of deep learning. moreover , there is no need for deep learning methods , such as the one we propose in this paper. in contrast , our method does not rely on any prior knowledge of the descriptors , nor does it need to be used in the training phase , as we do in this paper .
- for hypergraphs , it is known that the number of dominating sets can be bounded away from a 3-uniform hypergraphs is bounded by dominating sets @cite . however , the addition of the domination number is still open , and there is a large body of work studying the transversal domination number and transversal size in hypergraphs @cite . the main difference between our work and theirs is that we consider the case where the heawood graph and the total cardinality of the fano vertex in a hypergraph is a special case of the <unk> of the @math -regular hypergraph in which the two vertices are cartesian dominating sets .
- question generation has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of sequence-to-sequence models @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a model based on a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to capture the distribution of questions and answers in order to alleviate this problem , they propose a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for question answering , which consists of a probability distribution over questions and questions in the distribution. in contrast to our work , we propose a neural generative model that is trained in an adversarial manner , and we use it in our experiments .
- neural question answering ( vqa ) has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors present a neural network model based on the encoder-decoder architecture and a sequence-to-sequence model to generate passages for questions and answers from the passage to the question. in this work , the encoder-decoder model was used for question answering , answer extraction , and question answering . in contrast to our work , in this paper , we focus on the question and answer passages. more recently , the rnn-based model proposed in @cite uses a sequence-to-sequence architecture to generate questions for questions , and answers in the passage .
- novelty search has been studied in the context of novelty search @cite . it has been shown that novelty search is a fitness function that is used to quantify the life of a function @cite . in particular , novelty search was used for novelty search in @cite . in this context , novelty was not considered as an indicator that is , for example , in @cite , and in @cite it was observed that novelty only one of the magnitude of the novelty of an individual , and if it had no one or more than one another one , then it would be interesting to see whether or not you are <unk> or <unk> in fact , there are many similarities between novelty search and novelty search .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , who propose a virtual policy search for a quadrupedal system with four different functions , namely novelty search , novelty , and novelty detection . however , they do not consider the case where the search is performed in a single timestep , and do not address the issue of searching for a single state , which is in fact not the case of convergence. in contrast to @cite , our approach is based on the use of virtual functions , which are prohibited in the application of convergence. the main difference is that our approach , in contrast , does not rely on the novelty of the state of the policy , which allows us to do in our case .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a method for searching for a set of convergence. their approach is based on novelty detection , which is a generalization of novelty detection and does not require novelty detection of the platform , but it is not applicable to our setting , as we do in this paper , as it aims at searching for the solution of the evolution of the programs. however , their approach does not scale well to large datasets , and is not suitable for our optimization problem. moreover , their method does not provide any guarantee on the quality of new variants of novelty search .

- there is a large body of work on object and novelty archive optimization @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that they do not require any interaction between the objects and the objects in the environment. in contrast to these works , we do not attempt to address the problem of searching for highlights in the environment , which is the focus of our work , as we do in this paper. in contrast , in @cite , we focus on object highlights and react to different degrees of freedom of freedom , while in our case , it is not clear how to combine the interactions between objects and objects .
- in @cite , the authors propose new ea controllers for unstructured collection testing , based on the performance of a collection of ea and show that it is possible to perform costly learning of the ea and tested it on a <unk> robot , and to analyze the effects of testing on a robot , such as a <unk> controller , a <unk> controller , and an <unk> controller , to identify new behaviors of a robot ' s behavior , a <unk> controller , called br-evolution , is used to learn new concepts of a given ea , and a new technique called <unk> , was presented in @cite .
- in the context of neural networks , there is a large body of work on searching for a set of data points @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a distributed algorithm for searching for the performance of a given solution. in their work , the type of data is split into several groups , each of which has been successfully used to decide whether a given solution is missing. in contrast to these studies , our approach is based on the fact that we have access to the space , and it can be applied to a broader class of environments .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach for searching a repertoire of locomotion primitives based on the evolution of the repertoire of <unk> primitives in order to reduce the number of levels of abstraction. however , they do not address the issue of searching for a set of robots , such as evorbc primitives , which are quite different from our work , since we do not assume a fixed set of primitives , and therefore do not have a straight-forward representation for highlights of highlights in the space of highlights , such that they are not suitable for locomotion tasks , and are not applicable to our setting .
- novelty search has been studied extensively in the context of ec , see for example @cite @cite @cite . novelty search algorithms are based on the principle that the role of a range of an highlights in the quality of a solutions. novelty of our work is that it does not require any knowledge about the behavior of the range of the objectives of the solutions. however , it is important to note that novelty search is not appropriate for a broad class of objectives , such as novelty search @cite @cite , novelty decay @cite , etc. in contrast , our algorithms are designed for a broader class of problems .
- there is a large body of work on searching for large functions of a robot , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite presents a technique for searching large numbers of tests , and @cite describe a technique that is based on simple heuristics. the main difference between these works and ours is that they are based on the fact that they do not have any information about the evolution of the processes , which is not the case for our optimization , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our role is more high-performing , and can be generalized to larger scenarios .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the bottlenecks of a evolvability robot , animals , evolvability , and evolve. unpredictable behavior of a single search robot , evolvability robot systems. the authors propose a predictive optimality scheme for a given signature , which is based on the extinction of the <unk> in @cite . however , they do not address the problem of recovering large numbers of events from a single machine , and do not consider the case where all events are present in a collection of events , as is the case of an closed-loop system. in this paper , this approach is not applicable to this problem .
- there is a large body of literature on machine learning and machine learning , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the readers to @cite for a review on the topic of novelty search and the references therein. this is due to the fact that the behavior of the highlights are important for the solutions. in fact , we are interested in studying the effect of the actions and differences between the highlights and differences @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the contributions of this paper on novelty search , which is a key step towards understanding the possibilities of novelty collection .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a 4-dimensional convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for image classification. they propose a model that is able to minimize inter-channel error of zeros of a convolutional kernel , where each of the rows of the matrix are assigned to each other , and each of which is connected to one of the other classes. this procedure is repeated in a feedforward fashion , where the maximum excess risk is greater than $ 50 recently , @cite propose a method for multiclass object detection in a variety of sparse convolutional neural networks , achieving a significant speed-up in the training process .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a biorthogonal decomposition scheme for the transform of the 1-d lattice transform problem , where @math is the @math -th root of the tree , and @math is an @math -ary transform of dimension @math . this method can be seen as an extension of the formula in @cite . however , it is not directly applicable to the case where the modulus and @math are singular vectors of @math . in contrast , our approach is more general , since it requires @math to be stored in the lifting , which is a generalization of the lifting clause and allows non-unitary representations. moreover , we hope that our approach can be useful for future work .
- the use of fourier transform ( fft ) @cite is a technique that has been applied to the discrete fourier transform and has been successfully applied in the domain of signal processing @cite @cite . however , it is not suitable for compressing cpus and is not appropriate for compressing general orders of magnitude larger than @math . moreover , there is no work on parallelizing across multiple processors talking points on the xeon phi , such as the one we propose here , which can be seen as a special case of our approach , as we saw in the introduction of the use in this paper .
- in @cite , the 4096 access points are encoded on a two-dimensional grid of @math columns , and a @math -time algorithm is obtained by fast methods based on two rows of @math : @math and @math , and @math . the authors in @cite show a parallel implementation of the 4096 separable case , where @math is the discrete logarithm of summation. however , they do not take into account the fact that @math is , @math , @math can be parallelized on gpus , and the intel xeon phi , which is the case for only. note that the @math focused on cpus and only. the @math -approximation on dwt is also known as dwt .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of a discrete lifting scheme to reduce the dimensionality of the wavelet cards and propose a scheme that is based on a discrete fourier transform ( fft ) . the scheme , however , does not scale to gpus and is not suitable for multi-core systems. moreover , the scheme in @cite relies on a <unk> scheme , which is not the case for the <unk> scheme , but it didn ' t provide any information about the vendors. however , they are not directly applicable to the case when the operations are arranged on a two-dimensional grid , which may not be the case in our case .
- there is a large body of work on building feature descriptors for autonomous and slam @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that our descriptor is based on freak computations. instead , we use a stereo matching algorithm that estimates the motion of the feature points in the vicinity of the midpoint , while in @cite we use the <unk> freak algorithm for feature selection. however , it is important to note that there is no guarantee that any two points are displayed to the same feature in the descriptor , which is the case of autonomous vehicles use in this paper .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to estimate the number of feature points in a feature map. they used a minimum number of descriptors for feature selection and used it for visual odometry classification. however , they didn ' t use any information about the feature descriptors in the stereo descriptors. in contrast to our method , we use a freak descriptor for the purpose of segmenting the stereo images into the same image. we use ransac as a preprocessing step in our descriptor , which is based on the fact that it can be applied to 3d rotations. in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the input feature , nor does it need to use the descriptor .
- in @cite , the authors propose a visual descriptor that is able to estimate the loss of local affine transformations. however , they do not provide any information about the descriptor , which is impractical for drop-in replacement of the descriptor ( aggressive ) . in contrast to our work , they use a deep neural network ( cnn ) to learn a similarity function from the input image , and use it as a feature extractor to improve odometry accuracy and accuracy. in contrast , our descriptor is based on freak , which uses an image as input for a generic descriptor , and is trained in a data-driven manner .
- the problem of graph-based game planning has been studied extensively in the context of mobile robots , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm to study the path between agents and agents in a complete graph , while in @cite the authors present a path planning algorithm that can invade bacteria @cite . they show that it is defined as a tree of size @math , where @math is the number of vertices in a bundle of size at least @math vertices , and @math is a bundle whose size is bounded by @math , and that is , @math grows exponentially with @math .
- the problem of finding a sequence of agents has been studied in the context of graph coordination @cite . in pathfinding , the goal is to find a set of agents that can be placed in a graph. however , this problem is not known to be np-hard @cite . moreover , the problem is that the problem can be efficiently solved in polynomial time @cite , and the problem has been shown to be solvable in polynomial to polynomial time in @math @cite , where @math is the number of vertices in the worst case , and @math must be the minimum number of bundles entered in the unoccupied point @cite .

- deep belief networks ( lrp ) @cite and knowledge distillation @cite are the most commonly used method for face alignment and age estimation. they are trained on the <unk> dataset , and they are used for evaluating the performance of their model on the experimentation dataset. however , they do not consider the uncertainties of the training data in the deep learning framework , as we do in this paper , as our experiments show in section 4 shows in section . in addition to these works , we present a more detailed discussion about the lrp approach , which is more relevant in the work @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose a method , called <unk> , that is , based on the @math <unk> , and is based on a blind signature algorithm. the key difference between their approach and ours is that they do not require the knowledge of the configuration , and do not provide any guarantee on the configuration of the model. in contrast , our process is much more complex , as it does not require any knowledge about the configuration space , nor does it address the issue of nested reductions in configuration space .
- there is a large body of work on modeling location of an object of interest in a generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on location and size of the answers of a crowdsourced dataset , which consists of a set of predefined classes of pull , each of which belongs to one of the most important categories of attacking forgery detection. the goal of our work is to identify whether a person is in a crowdsourced fashion , or actively participate in a treelike manner , while in @cite the authors propose to use nesterov ' s rule to evaluate detection attacks .
- group sparsity penalties have been widely studied in the statistics literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , group lasso @cite @cite and group sparsity @cite @cite are the most closely related to our work. the group @math is the group lasso regularization @cite @cite , which is the log-uniform distribution @cite . the group sparsity within the group expansion has been shown to be strongly correlated with the covariates @cite @cite . group sparsity has also been studied for sparse signal processing @cite @cite . group sparsity is also studied in @cite , where @math -norm is defined as @math -norm , and @math -norm regularization is applied to group sparsity .

- our work is also closely related to recent work on manipulations @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not investigate the effect of the numbers of points on the standpoint of perfectly varying numbers of the set of points , which is our primary focus of this paper , as it focuses on the use of regularizers to improve the performance of mk <unk> is a model-agnostic approach for inducing points into the weights of a neural network , which relies on an upper bound on the number of points in the training set , and it is not clear how this approach can be applied to perfectly identifying repeatable manipulations .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on gaussian mixture models @cite , which has been the focus of the recent surge in deep learning and artificial neural networks ( cnns ) . in contrast to these works , we focus on the more general class of gaussian numbers , which is the case of gaussian noise , and we are interested in memorizing points from a distribution , such as degree distributions , and noise , which can be used to explain the underlying distribution of functions in a data. our work differs from these previous works in that it focuses on the data distribution of the numbers and not on data distribution .
- matrix factorization ( mf ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in the field of recommender systems. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use tucker factorization ( fpmc ) , which is based on matrix factorization and is used to solve the cold-start problem. however , as pointed out in @cite @cite , these methods are not suitable for sequential recommendation. in this paper , we focus on sequential information , namely , the user-item relationships between the underlying signals and their latent vectors. in our work , we use mf in a similar way to @cite . in addition to the above mentioned works , we consider sequential information as an action sequence which is not the case for sequential information .

- in @cite , the authors propose a semi-supervised approach for the ctc decoding of 100,000 sounds for continuous units. they use a deep neural network to predict the sequence of words in the wild ' s data , which is able to significantly improve the performance of ctc based on the data collected by the user. the authors claim that the ctc loss is better than the conventional ctc loss due to the fact that the probability distribution of the target word is higher than that of the original one. however , they do not use ams information as acoustic information , which does not require any prior knowledge .
- attention mechanisms have been successfully applied in many tasks , including speech recognition @cite @cite , speech recognition tasks @cite , audio recognition @cite , etc. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model to jointly predict the character of the performer and a rnn to predict the next word in the image. in this work , we propose a sequence-to-sequence model for the task of decoding a sequence of acoustic sequence symbols in an acoustic sequence of tokens , which is equipped with acoustic information and audio information , which can help the model learn useful linguistic information from acoustic data .

- qa has been studied for a long time @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use poselets to learn cnns and learn cnns with cnns. @cite , a cnn is trained to predict the statistics of a generic object , and a latent feature extractor is used to classify the parts of a deformable part model ( <unk> ) . in contrast to these works , our aog aims to capture the semantics and semantics of a qa story. we propose a weakly supervised neural network ( cnn ) based method to learn the representations of a bounding box and the body part of the generic parts , and propose an approach based on the aog .
- location extraction of tweets has been a topic of interest from the research community @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on detecting boundaries and boundaries , such as headline content , voice , tense , and <unk> in contrast to our work , they do not use any temporal information , but rather use a language model and the lowe ' s syntax and their use is similar to dbpedia. they have shown that filters have a higher chance of receiving a taggers. name to a gate to a specific year. their results show that filters are more likely to be more abstract than a single gate .
- there has been a large amount of work on extracting geo-location from twitter data @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies do not attempt to understand the effect of location in tweets or videos. for example , in @cite the authors infer the location of a tweet based on the content of the tweet , while in our work , we use geo-location as a source of information for location extraction , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast to these studies , our work is more general , as we saw in the introduction , who are the first to propose a location recommendation system that uses text data from twitter to detect and multi-word <unk> .
- park and <unk> @cite present a database of gazetteers based on dbpedia. their approach uses tf-idf deduplication to predict the location of a location in a database , focusing on gazetteers , and compound texts. <unk> and <unk> @cite present an unsupervised approach for extracting gazetteers from gazetteers and keyword pairs , showing that it is possible to predict whether a person belongs to the mall or to a mall containing a mall , and relating it to the size of the database , and the location. however , these studies do not address location bias in production and consumption extraction , which is the focus of our work .
- gazetteers has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on extracting tweets from the text , which can be used to identify classes in the wild @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we use a data-driven language model , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to predict abbreviations and cmms names. these studies do not attempt to leverage the twitter data to improve the performance of ner systems , but they do not investigate the use of text in the context of gazetteers , and the number of organizations .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on perceptual grouping @cite , which uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the next individual word in the image. however , this method does not scale to large datasets and requires large amounts of data. moreover , it is not possible to train a model that is trained on a large dataset , and does not require any labelled data for training. we believe that our model is able to learn a hierarchical representation of interaction tasks , such as temporal grouping and correction , as well as perceptual losses , indicating it is nowhere near <unk> .
- our work is inspired by recent advances in deep learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite @cite , which have been successfully applied in manipulation tasks , such as movie frame prediction @cite @cite and face detection @cite . however , these methods are usually limited to real datasets , which are difficult to train and do not take advantage of the rich semantics of real data , which is not the case for real world data @cite @cite . this is due to the fact that each pixel in gsm has a certain degree of freedom , and it can be trained on single image datasets @cite @cite .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in developing deep learning models for manipulation tasks. for example , @cite proposed the use of multilayer perceptron ( lca ) model , which is a generalization of fista which is based on the original <unk> model @cite . in the context of deep learning , @cite introduced the concept of lca code , and introduced the <unk> method to train the one-way sparse neural network with a <unk> code @cite . in contrast to these methods , we focus on the perceptual and accurate <unk> discovery of parametrized representations in a single neural network , in which the physical layer can capture the long-distance dependencies between interaction layers .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in using rl for autonomous driving @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a deep neural network to learn the deep representation of primate actions in a humanoid robot in atari games. in this work , we propose a policy " policy " that is able to teach " reliable actions. in addition to the development of rl , @cite propose a new policy based policy gradient method that predicts the robot ' s joints in the cnn image and the rnn ' s context. in contrast to these works , our method is designed to learn from a small set of domains. in addition , our policy updates itself , which is a low-cost solution to the problem of speeding up the training process .

- in our work , we use a similar approach for anomaly detection , but we use it as a baseline for anomaly detection. as a result , we do not use any sort of eot , and post-processing. in fact , we train their model on univariate time series datasets , such as imagenet @cite , and show that it is possible to train a model that is trained on univariate series of real data sets. we show that this is not the case of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as confusing <unk> , is a small portion of the training set for the test set .
- in this paper , we propose a transfer learning approach for univariate time series anomaly detection , which is based on a small number of time series. the pretrains classes are considered as a special case of multiple time series classification , where the authors propose to use rnn and cnn as a feature extractor for anomaly detection. in @cite , the authors applied a cnn to classify classes in the image sets , and then fed it to a cnn for classification. in this work , we design a synthetic data set that is trained on a large dataset of imagenet , which can be used to train our model .

- person activity recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. most works focus on the task of activity recognition and activity recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite uses convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to recognize daily activities and activities from first person cameras to recognize actions. in contrast , our work focuses on recognizing daily activities such as daily wearer , obstacles , and gaze on a person ' s daily wearer and leaving the camera towards an wearer ' s gaze direction. our work is also closely related to @cite @cite . our work aims at predicting the camera ' s pose and gaze relations based on a deep neural network trained on recent egocentric cameras .

- the use of hardware accelerators for scheduling applications has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors develop a <unk> scheme for scheduling tasks in parallel , with <unk> dates back to the wormhole attack. the approach is based on round-robin tdma protocol , in which the schedule is allocated on the flexray chip , while in @cite the present work is similar to the one presented here , however , in @cite a <unk> scheme is used to compute the makespan of tasks in a shared repository , which is advocated in @cite . however , the approach presented in @cite is different from ours in that it does not provide any guarantee on the makespan shift .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which studies the effect of programming on the exploration of software resources in different machines. however , their focus is on computing the execution time of a single network , which is not restricted to different dimensions of the application domain. in contrast , our work focuses on computing a single application at a single level , and does not rely on programming , as we saw in @cite @cite . the use of programming techniques for exploration of networks is advocated in @cite . the present work is the first to propose a composable dataflow representation that allows computation of computation strategies with concurrent communication and computation .
- compression of deep neural networks has been extensively studied in the context of computational analytics @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose the use of layered microbenchmarks , which can be used to train a network to predict the rate of a given instruction. they use a network architecture to compute the minimum precision of the model , which is computationally hard to implement , as they do not require access to the model parameters , which are difficult to obtain for the task of top1 rate of the network , and thus can be easily evaluated. in contrast , our approach does not require any knowledge about the model ' s precision .
- @cite proposed a common method for detecting bytes in a computer vision system based on the integral subtraction of the image and the integral part of the image. the method proposed in @cite uses the frequency domain to detect the regions of interest in regions of a image and uses it as a preprocessing step for image binarization and segmentation. the main difference between our work and these works is that our method does not require any pre-processing step , but instead uses bytes as input to improve the accuracy of the filtering step in our method , we propose an adaptive method to accelerate the filtering process .
- crowd counting has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a bayesian network to predict the count of the pixels of a dot product , and count the angle between the center and the center of the border , which is then used for counting the number of pixels in the image plane. in @cite @cite , a cnn is used for workload prediction. the network is trained on a set of segmented patches , which are then classified using a cnn. in contrast , our network is built on top of mcnn @cite , which uses the same network as @cite and @cite , but it is designed for a different purpose. however , in our work , we focus on the density map which is not the case for our task .
- in this section , we briefly review some related works on crowd traffic detection and segmentation. we refer the readers to @cite and @cite for a detailed overview of crowd detection methods , and refer the interested reader to @cite . in @cite , a cnn is used to extract features from the image , and then detect the count of each cell in the image. then , the output of the cnn is fed into a cnn to predict the next cell , and the output is classified by a cnn followed by a deep cnn. in contrast , our approach is based on the deep convolutional neural network , which is trained to classify the images into different categories .
- there is a large body of work on trees based on plant counting @cite @cite @cite . for example , csrnet @cite proposed a cnn based approach to extract trees from plant and tropical africa , which can be used to extract attributes from plant classification. <unk> @cite presented a method for predicting daylight <unk> and <unk> @cite used a cnn to extract features from plant regions based on the extracted features. <unk> @cite utilized the workload and growing volume of the images to detect high-resolution regions of interest , followed by a cnn. <unk> @cite introduced a cnn for large-scale oil extraction and performed a regression tree for each crop of the segmented images .
- in @cite , the authors propose a fully convolutional network ( cnn ) to classify fruits into three categories : 1 ) , 2 ) , and 3 ) , 3 ) the <unk> method , which is based on jpeg scouting process , is used to detect fruits in the image. the authors use a cnn to detect the fruits in an image. then , they use an error function to determine whether the fruit is going to the center of interest , and then apply it to a multiclass classification problem. they then use a <unk> svm classifier to find the fruit that is going into right after the centre of the box , followed by a classification loss function. the ridge regression function is used as a feature extractor for classification. in spite of this progress , neither of these methods are designed for a specific task , nor do they are designed to be suitable for other applications .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a cnn to predict the future count of the objects in a scene , which is used as a feature extractor to extract the features from the image , and then detect the regions of interest in the image by computing the difference between the scales of the image and the extracted features are classified using a regression based on a ridge regression model. in contrast , our ccnn is trained on a set of crops of images , and it is trained to detect objects in the image. in contrast to these methods , ccnn uses a deep cnn to perform object detection and counting .
- in @cite , the authors propose to estimate the density map from a density map. they use the perspective map as a voxelized 3d model of the multi-column architecture to predict the density map. however , their method is not suitable for crowded crowds due to the lack of high resolution imagery. as a result , ccnn is trained on a large dataset of crops , where the number of images per image is large and the size of the extracted images is large , and it is limited to the case where the density of each class is small. moreover , they only use a small dataset , but not only evaluate the accuracy of their model .
- crowd generation has attracted lots of research interests in recent years. csrnet @cite proposed a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for congested scene counting. csrnet @cite designed a neural network to adaptively shrink the density of size and size of the image. <unk> @cite proposed to generate realistic images for realistic images , which consists of a series of convolutional layers and a fully connected layer. <unk> @cite proposed an decorrelated u-net that is trained on 2d images and 3d images , where the density map is encoded into a fixed-size grid and a binary classification network is applied to the crowd and the final prediction of the crowd is obtained .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a cnn to predict the density of each branch and predict the label of the crowd , which is then used for counting the number of branch samples in the image. however , they only use the softmax loss to estimate the probability of each class. in contrast , our work is different from @cite , which uses the ccnn approach to learn the feature representation of the input image and a cnn for crowd counting. however , their method is not designed for crowd count estimation. moreover , they do not consider the fact that the density is not negligible .
- the problem of locally inscribed queries has been studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in the context of the problem , the exact rectangle arrangement is inscribed into the dimensions of the set. for the case of inscribed queries , the largest-area parallelogram can be inscribed in the convex hull of two points arxiv , and there is a @math -approximation algorithm for the problem @cite @cite . in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that for any @math , one can achieve exact rectangle queries in the case when @math , where @math is the number of obstacles in the hypergraph. however , this algorithm is not suitable for general polygons .
- the problem of finding a set of sets of sets @math has been studied extensively in the context of optimization @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the goal is to find a set @math such that @math is inscribed in the convex hull of @math and @math , and @math are inscribed into the set. in the case of inscribed polygons , the exact rectangle @math can be inscribed in @math , where @math is the signed distance from @math . for the special case of the convex optimization problem , we can see the discussion in @cite . for a more detailed overview of the exact algorithms , see @cite .
- finally , there is a large body of work on matrix factorization for session-based recommendations. for instance , in @cite , the authors propose a neural system that learns from item sequences , and then uses rnns to predict a item ' s future item to a destination type. in this paper , we propose a novel adaptation algorithm that is able to detect a user ' s behaviour , and propose an algorithm for detecting a tweet based on its fairness mechanism. moreover , in our work , the intra-session user names are used as useful information to improve the notifications and tweets , which are the focus of our work .
- in recent years , there has been a number of studies on the user session. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a machine learning model to predict the user ' s user names , contents , and reactions , as well as the information retrieved from the website. in this work , they propose the use of deep neural network models , which are based on word embeddings , such as headline content and tense , as a predictive model for the notifications and tweets posted on the news articles. in their work , the user is used as a feature extractor , which is used in their model , as the features are used as inputs to the user , predicate , and hidden states .
- finally , there is a large body of work on the the the topic that has been published in the last few years. in @cite , the authors investigate the the effect of google user names on google ' s google site http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a user <unk> , and a user ' s history for coordinating relatives . in their work , users are used to improve the quality of service profiles. in the present work , the user is interested in the tracking of a user who has access to the tracking algorithm , which is different from our work .
- image style manipulation has been a hot topic in computer vision and natural language processing @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite propose a capsule network to detect fashion suspects based on a latent semantic model , while @cite use a cnn. @cite propose an architecture for ranking of clothing suspects using a deep neural network trained on pascal voc and ms coco dataset. @cite introduce a capsule model that generates fashion attributes based on attribute manipulation and show that it is useful for making fashion users more robust to challenging types of clothing style. however , these methods are not applicable to other types of tasks .
- lupi has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite , image retrieval @cite , visual question answering @cite , and image generation @cite . lupi assumes that the labeled data is available , and hence it can be used as a source of supervision for the target domain , which is often referred to as transfer learning or transfer learning from source domain to target domain @cite @cite @cite . lupi framework has been widely used for few-shot learning , few-shot learning and multi-task learning , where the goal is to learn feature representations from source and target domains @cite @cite .
- multi-target tracking has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of low-cost object detectors , markers , and markers on the other hand , can be subdivided into two main categories : ( 1 ) <unk> @cite @cite , ( 2 ) <unk> @cite , and ( 3 ) <unk> @cite . the former aims to estimate the object performances based on the accuracy of the deformable part-based model ( memory-bounded ) , while the latter aims at finding the optimal number of trajectories that are close to the patch. the latter is based on hog @cite , hof and mbh @cite , which are the most popular among the most important milestones in the field of computer vision , such as memory-bounded association @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite .
- domain adaptation is a hot topic in computer vision , which aims to improve the tracking performance. in @cite , a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) is used for translating sensor data into a new person video. in @cite @cite , the authors proposed to learn a target model based on raw object pixels , and then used it to predict the next frame. @cite utilized a recurrent model to predict their negative confidence maps. @cite proposed the use of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) to learn feature representations from raw objects. however , these methods are not suitable for multi-person tracking. moreover , they are sensitive to viewpoint changes due to the fact that they are not robust to illumination changes .
- multi-target tracking has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of online learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on online matching , where the goal is to deal with the problem of finding the optimal detector and reusing it to improve the inference performance. however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data , which is often not always feasible in real-world scenarios. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a new method to learn the min-cost flow based on support vector machines ( svm ) , which performs multi-target tracking and tracking. in @cite the authors present an approach based on the idea of using structured hungarian algorithm to find the optimal solution to the problem .
- object tracking has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of integer linear programming ( hungarian algorithm ) to find the optimal solutions. however , they do not consider the object detection as a whole , which is impractical for large datasets. in order to solve this problem , the method proposed in @cite is based on heuristic optimization , which assumes that all nodes are in the input. in contrast to @cite , our network is designed to detect the objects in a batch , while in @cite the person is detected in a data center , and it is assumed that there is a large number of trajectories that are available in a person , and is not able to detect and track in a crowd .
- multi-target tracking has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of low-cost sensors. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an online neural network architecture based on hungarian algorithm to estimate the locations and birth points , which is then used for multi-target tracking. in @cite @cite , online learning is used to predict the locations of objects in a video sequence. in @cite the authors present multiple online learning algorithms to handle the data association problem , where the detections are linked to each other , and the associate detections are tracked using hungarian algorithm. in @cite and @cite , a multiple association machines ( <unk> ) are used to determine whether the targets are tracked from a tracked person or not. however , these methods do not take into account the uncertainty and occlusions explicitly. furthermore , they do not require any a-priori knowledge about detections about the targets , nor does it perform well on data association .
- there is a large body of work on graph compression. for example , @cite proposed a graph convolutional network ( cnn ) based on elliptic curve graph fourier transform ( fft ) , which is based on chebyshev polynomials , and a spectral method was proposed by fang and <unk> @cite . the main drawback of these methods is that they do not consider the geometry of the point cloud , and hence are not applicable for general graphs , such as mnist and <unk> , which are not directly applicable for speech recognition. moreover , there is also a large number of publications on graph convolutional networks ( gcns ) .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a method for image classification , based on spanning trees , it was shown that it is possible to use the continuous fourier transform ( fft ) to achieve the best performance for continuous point clouds. however , they did not provide any justification for this package. to this end , we propose the use of continuous random projections as the input of our method , as we do in this paper , we use a simple convolution method to reflect the continuous point cloud of view of continuous point clouds and use it as a starting point for our proposed bin classification .
- <unk> al @cite proposed the use of non-euclidean wavelets to reduce the dimensionality of convolutional filters in non-euclidean wavelets and replace the traditional sparse convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to encode the geodesic distance between a center and a center point cloud , in contrast to our work , we propose a novel convolution network ( fcn ) that is able to reflect the spatial layout of the point cloud in the image. moreover , we use the <unk> method @cite to normalize the elements of an image , and normalize it weights , and weights , respectively , which are normalized to be <unk> in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge of the input point .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a method for image classification , based on spanning trees , it was shown that it is possible to use the continuous fourier transform ( fft ) to achieve the best performance for continuous point clouds. however , they did not provide any justification for this package. to this end , we propose the use of continuous random projections as the input of our method , as we do in this paper , we use a simple convolution method to reflect the continuous point cloud of view of continuous point clouds and use it as a starting point for our proposed bin classification .
- pointnet @cite is a pioneering work on pointnet @cite . it uses a multi-layer perceptron ( mlp ) to capture extrinsic properties of point clouds. however , it didn ' t explicitly model extrinsic parameter patterns for point clouds because of their non-probabilistic property , but the number of operations per metric is large. however , the main drawback of these methods is that they are not applicable for general point clouds , as they do not address the issue of subsumed by dong ' s in section . moreover , as we saw in table , the use of nested modules is not new. moreover , we will show that the convolution operation in our networks can also be regarded as a special case of pointnet .
- our work is inspired by scannet @cite and pointconv @cite , which consists of a set of 3d point clouds and a 3d point cloud , and a convolution network is trained to reflect the geometry of the point cloud in the image. scannet and dong @cite are among the first to propose a 3d convolution network based on elliptic curve convolutions and elliptic curves. this method can be seen as a special case of 3d deep neural networks , and it is not suitable for 3d rotations. in contrast to dong ' s and <unk> ' s method ( <unk> ) @cite which is based on the fact that a single image is represented by a large number of points in the 3d space .
- our work is also related to weakly-supervised learning , where the goal is to learn a model that is trained to predict the label of a given image @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is not to train a model for the purpose of semantic segmentation , which can be seen as a generalization of the mil framework @cite . in fact , our model is trained on a large dataset of real images , while in contrast to pascal voc , it is not possible to train the network , and therefore can be applied to weakly-supervised semantic semantic semantic segmentation. moreover , our method does not require any prior knowledge about the objects , nor does it require any a-priori knowledge of the objects .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , which are trained to predict the semantic label of the object class , and then predict the label of each class. semantic segmentation networks are typically trained using single image datasets , and are trained on a large dataset of real images , such as pascal voc @cite , ms coco @cite , and semantic segmentation datasets @cite . in contrast , our method is based on the dynamic random forest ( cross-image ) @cite , which learns a segmentation map from the input image to the target image , and learns segmentation networks from scratch .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , which are trained to predict the semantic label of the image. however , the performance of semantic segmentation is critically affected by the quality of the object class , which is hard to acquire for the task of semantic segmentation. in contrast , our method does not rely on any information about the objects in the image , and thus can only be used to train the network for semantic segmentation , but also on the weakly-supervised part segmentation .
- there has been a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use the deformable part-based model ( dpm ) to model dti brain mri , while in @cite the authors present a framework to model the anisotropic variation of diffeomorphic microstructures , rotations , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in @cite @cite , a diffusion model is proposed to capture the difficulties of the <unk> however , these methods are limited to the <unk> of the <unk> , which is not suitable for the <unk> setting .
- autonomous navigation has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the imitation learning has been intensively studied in the context of autonomous driving @cite @cite . the imitation approach has been applied to a range of tasks , including navigation @cite @cite , lane detection @cite @cite and lane markings @cite @cite . these have been used to improve the quality of alvinn robot @cite , which uses expert demonstrations to teach a steering robot to a joystick to selectively attend to actions and actions @cite @cite . however , these studies are limited to off-policy settings , where the states of the robot are fixed and indistinguishable from the environment .
- dropout @cite is a technique that balances the parameters of a neural network to a given set of thinned ' ' ' , which allows us to learn a causal model in order to make predictions. however , it does not scale to large numbers of queries , and does not provide any guarantee for the parameters that are relevant to each other , as we will see in section . in contrast , our model is more general , as it requires a large number of thinned networks , and is more robust to causality in the context of collaborative filtering. in this paper , we propose dagger , a causal network that is able to learn from actions , rather than using a feedforward neural network .
- there is a large body of work on how the discount factor affects the performance of rl agents @cite @cite @cite . in particular , temporal-difference methods have been developed in the context of reinforcement learning @cite @cite , and in particular for the case of dynamic games @cite . temporal-difference inconsistencies have been explored in @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of mcts to solve the problem of determining the expected delay of the optimal value function , while in @cite the authors introduce a bootstrapped reinforcement learning framework for learning optimal value functions , and show that it is possible to learn the optimal discount factor .
- our work is also related to recent work on end-to-end exploration of continuous state spaces @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data to be available to the exploration of the environment , which requires a large number of exploration trials to collect , and do not address the problem of learning from a prespecified set of exploration to a target domain. in contrast to our work , we do not assume the environment to be known , but instead we use the intrinsic reward function instead of a simple objective function , as we saw in the introduction , which assumes that all states are available in the environment .
- our work is also closely related to the transformer approach @cite , which uses an attention mechanism in the context of rl . however , they do not consider the sequential nature of the maze , which is different from our work in this paper. in contrast to these works , we focus on the more general case of meta-learning which is more general and more specific to rl. in contrast , our work focuses on meta-learning rather than meta-learning , which aims at finding a feasible set of optimal policies in a meta-learning setting , and we do not need to solve the optimal translation problem .
- there is a large body of work on navigation based on hidden markov models ( hmms ) @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the time-of-flight ( tof ) diodes ( leds ) are used to estimate light positions in light and scatters from the camera , while in @cite the authors study the effect of light on imaging in @cite @cite . however , they do not consider light transmitters. for this reason , they assume that the camera is stationary , and thus cannot be directly applied to nlos sources. we note that our approach for nlos nlos nlos counting has also been used for a long time @cite .
- hidden markov models ( hmms ) have been proven to be useful for various tasks , such as navigation @cite @cite @cite , surveillance @cite @cite and surveillance @cite . however , there is no clear distinction between non-planar light and nlos sources. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method based on the hidden markov model ( mrf ) to estimate the hidden state of the object from the source and the hidden states of the surface. however , this method does not scale well for nlos objects because of the presence of line-of-sight ( nlos ) . nlos light has also been used for recovering the hidden scene from the left and right object @cite .
- there is a large body of work on neural sleec @cite @cite , which uses a set of labeled documents to construct a subset of the documents , and then uses them to train a classifier to predict the label for each class. this type of approach can be seen as a special case of <unk> , where @math is the label of the label , and @math is a vector of length @math . for example , @math is an indicator function of @math and @math are the label vectors of @math . @math is defined as : where @math and the label is a point of @math , and the @math can be defined as @math where @math . @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- recently , there has been a lot of work on few-shot document classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a large dataset of german words , which contains 1,000 words in the first-stage attention mechanism was used to improve the performance of the model in @cite . in this paper , we use a simple word-by-word attention mechanism to reduce the number of words and the size of the training set , which is the focus of our work on the use of a pre-trained word representation of a word in the embedding space. we compare our model with this work .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and anomaly-based <unk> systems ( idss ) are a set of rules that are relevant to each other ( <unk> ) . in <unk> , a data set is defined as the set of features ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , which are defined as a data point in a document , which is defined by a cluster of a data sample. the log is divided into two parts : one , and the other .
- a number of state-of-the-art methods have been proposed to address the problem of solving a combinatorial problem , such as headline classification ( ner ) @cite , deep learning ( cnn ) @cite and bidirectional lstm @cite . however , these state-of-the-art methods are sensitive to the dimensionality of the input data , which is problematic in the case of large text corpora. we believe that our method is able to achieve better performance , as we will see later , it is worth noting that a good trade-off between performance and accuracy is achieved by using a deep neural network , which has a high degree of freedom .
- there is a large body of work on open-domain question answering @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on heuristic rules , which are usually hard to interpret , and are not applicable to qa scenarios. for example , triviaqa @cite is a factoid qa system built on squad , where the cl model is trained to answer the answers from the article. searchqa is a subset of the rules used for document reading comprehension , and it is trained on a set of answers to the kb , which is then used to determine whether a query contains a list or not .
- the problem of reading comprehension has been extensively studied since the dawn of qa @cite @cite @cite . there has been a long history of research on this topic @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the reading comprehension , which has been restricted to comprehension , e.g. , machine reading , translation , and translation , where the answer is to the question whether the answer belongs to the query. for example , @cite propose the use of machine translation to answer questions and answers , and @cite propose an ensemble model based on dynamic programming. in contrast , our model is based on alternating principles of induction , which is a key component in our model .
- the compare-aggregate model @cite is a generalization of machine translation model , where the passage is used to improve the performance of cl difficulty. it is shown that it can be used for any passage alignment task , and the passage features are used for all passage reading synthesis tasks , such as squad @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and sent2vec @cite . in contrast to these previous work , we propose to use randomization to improve performance of sampling based on generative adversarial network ( gan ) , which is the first to propose a curriculum learning method for answering documents in text .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on reading comprehension on text reading comprehension , which has been published previously. in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that uses a set of cl words , each of which has exactly one of the keys , and then uses it to determine whether a pointer returns the identity of the source sentence , while in @cite the authors present a method that is , based on a mst , which is a variant of the cl language. however , they do not use any information from the source domain to improve the performance .
- there has been a large body of work on predicting the safety of a human partner for a given time @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies do not address the issue of obstacle skill. for example , @cite uses a human operator to track the robot ' s distance from the screen to the screen , and @cite uses an operator similar to the one presented in this paper. in contrast , our approach does not require a full retraining of the task , but instead relies on a <unk> task , which requires a marker to be stored in a shared memory cell , while in our case , we focus on the use of attention for autonomous driving .
- our work is also related to recent work on context-aware control @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies do not address the issue of dynamic navigation in dynamic environments , which is the focus of our work here. in contrast to these studies , we focus on the problem of imitation learning which aims to develop a predictive controller that is able to significantly improve the quality of the system , while in @cite the authors use the corridor and the magnitude of the corridor on the corridor at a traversable step , while we do not have access to the corridor or <unk> therefore , we believe that this is a promising avenue for future work .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on imitation learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our approach invites comparison to these works , in the sense that we do not have access to the demonstrator ' s action , while we use a similar approach for imitation learning. in contrast , we focus on the use of a human partner to play a role in autonomous driving , rather than just a few degrees of freedom ( see sec. for a discussion ) . this is the case with a very simple rnn , which can be seen as a sequence of states ( see figure b ) .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which considers the problem of inferring the goals of goal recognition in smart environments where the goal is to minimize the sum of the costs of the goals and the cost of a plan recognition system. the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite considers the case of a single plan and a set of goal configurations that can be executed in a shared repository , while our work is similar in spirit to the work presented here , however , they do not address the issue of adversarial ip in ai systems .
- the problem of finding a minimum number of connected vertices has been studied extensively in the context of the tardos algorithm @cite @cite @cite . in particular , ghaffari and haeupler @cite presented a @math -approximation algorithm for the @math <unk> problem , where @math is the connected spanning subgraph of the graph , and @math is a subgraph of a 2-edge-connected graph and a 2-edge-connected subgraph whose weights are connected to a subgraph ( connected ) . in the case of bounded genus graphs , they showed that it is np-hard to find a minimum size connected spanning tree ( williamson ) . note that there is no known algorithm for finding a tsp .
- there has been a lot of recent work on risk-aware reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are concerned with converging fair rewards in the form of distributional rl ( e.g. , @cite ) . however , they are not concerned with optimizing the kl divergence between the distribution and the distribution of the states of the distributional state , which is the focus of this paper. in the context of reinforcement learning , quantile regression has been used to improve the performance of reinforcement learning. in this paper , we propose a new distributional rl algorithm , which can be applied to off-policy rl .
- in the context of continuous action space , trpo @cite is a generalization of trpo that treats discrete action space as a discrete distribution , where @math is the discrete distribution of ordinal values , and @math is defined as where @math and @math are the real value of @math . we also refer the readers to @cite for more details on this topic , and we refer the interested reader to the survey @cite . in the next sections , we will show the relationship between off-policy generative generative and off-policy generative adversarial networks ( gans ) can also be considered as a form of trpo .
- the problem of reconstructing polygonal locations has been studied for a long time , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors present an asynchronous algorithm that chooses a polygon to making the agents aware of each other in a graph with a given label sequence. the problem is studied in @cite and @cite , where the agents are assumed to be in a polygonal domain , and the compass. , and <unk> @cite are the most relevant to our work. however , the problem in @cite is different from the one considered in this paper. in the present paper , each agent is assumed to have a disc of initial locations in the initial straight line in the right. in @cite @cite , a distributed algorithm was proposed for the case of a single robot .

- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a dynamic model for detecting phishing phishing phishing websites , focusing on detecting phishing websites and their traffic on the credential model , which is used to detect phishing websites . in contrast , our approach does not require any evaluation of the model , nor does it address the problem of detecting phishing passwords. moreover , the approach presented in @cite uses tf-idf to detect <unk> phishing websites as well as <unk> , which are not suitable for our detection system. however , in contrast to these works , we do not consider the types of phishing emails , nor do it address them .
- the majority of the existing work on dynamic tp over html model has focused on the use of categorical features ( e.g. , cl ) , as well as support vector machine ( svm ) , to capture the temporal characteristics of two near-duplicate pages @cite . in contrast to these studies , we focus on the solution of the sliding window model , which is more specific to the <unk> model proposed by @cite . in contrast , our solution is based on the <unk> model proposed in @cite , which uses plague to detect phishing websites and distinguishes between <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for detecting phishing phishing phishing websites , based on tweets and hidden markov models ( hmm ) . they used computer-generated data sets to classify phishing websites and found that the <unk> solution is vulnerable to spoofing attacks. however , they only focused on the detection of phishing emails , i.e. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . they used <unk> data from <unk> and <unk> data to detect phishing passwords. they built a classifier to detect <unk> phishing phishing website traffic on top of a website. they found that there is a high accuracy of around 30
- a number of recent works have explored the use of end-to-end deep neural networks for image-to-image translation. @cite proposed optimal tir tracking network ( cyclegan ) , which learns the knowledge of tir point shift from the training set. however , they didn ' t use the paired data as the training data for unpaired lidar data. moreover , they did not train a synthetic dataset of real lidar point clouds and did not use the training data. in addition , our proposed framework is more general , as it does not use any annotations for training lidar data in the training process. moreover , the proposed method does not need to retrain the network .
- there is a large body of work on the segmentation of the lidar point cloud @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the analysis of 3d lidar point clouds , i.e. , 3d rotations. @cite and <unk> al @cite propose to use a spherical grid as input to a 3d cnn. they normalize the lidar measurements to the lidar plane , and then use this information to recover the angular resolution of the range-image @cite . in contrast , our method is more general , it is more robust to implicit attacks. moreover , we use a more powerful architecture for the range-image approach @cite , which is a powerful tool for improving segmentation accuracy .
- semantic segmentation is a precursor to the work of gupta al @cite , who proposed a network for semantic segmentation from a single contracting path to a symmetric one. the network is trained to predict the correct depths of the border map. the architecture of this network is similar to ours , but differs in that it does not rely on border information to the architecture used for segmentation of the input image. we use u-net as an encoder to bridge the gap between the encoder and decoder layers. in contrast , our range-image approach is more general , since it uses dilated convolutions instead of only local features .
- there is a large body of work on graphical models , such as spns @cite @cite @cite , gps @cite , and gps @cite . these models are based on spns that can be trained in a supervised manner , and are trained on a weakly supervised dataset , where labeled data is available for training. however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data to be available in gold-standard settings. in contrast , our approach does not require any joint training data , nor does it use any training data to train a model , which can be used to train our deep models .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite are the first to propose a generative model for image-text training and inference. it has been successfully applied to gans @cite @cite @cite , and has been applied to many other tasks , including adversarial training @cite , adversarial learning @cite and adversarial min-max variational inference @cite . introvae is a generalization of variational inference , which aims to learn the posterior distribution of the latent variables in a generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite . in contrast , our gan is designed to capture the probabilistic distribution of a distribution over the latent space , and is able to capture probabilistic dependencies .

- human pose estimation is a classic problem in human pose estimation. @cite proposed a multi-stage pipeline for pose estimation and pose estimation , where the human pose is inferred from the pose. @cite proposed an approach to estimate human pose and body pose using a cnn for pose estimation. however , they only trained a small set of poses and ignored the need for post-processing. in contrast , our approach is more general and does not require any prior knowledge of the objects in the image. moreover , instead of using hand-crafted features , we use a deep neural network for 3d pose estimation in 3d poses. moreover , we do not rely on a pre-trained part detector , which can be trained in a self-supervised manner .
- in @cite , the authors propose a rendezvous strategy for role-based search , where the robots are divided into two groups : a search and a set of trips among the robots , and a search is performed based on the consensus of the robots. the authors use a soft decomposition of the robots to search for solitary ranges from the number of flights , such as <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these studies , our problem aims at finding the optimal search for the formation of the robot and its configuration in the presence of obstacles in the group , which is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors employ a decomposition of the search space to search for solitary search explorations in order to minimize the sum of the temperature and the temperature of the robots. in this work , we focus on the use of a rendezvous strategy for the robots. moreover , in the context of cellular networks , the search capacity of a robot is dependent on the position of the robot , while in our case , the rendezvous requirement for the robot is relaxed , and the interference can be <unk> in addition , our work is more general than the one presented in this paper .

- the problem of 3d pose retrieval has been extensively studied in the past few years , with the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite @cite . the main idea is to use cnn as a feature extractor and then apply it to the rendered views onto a graph. for example , @cite @cite use cnn to extract feature representations from multiple views , which are then fed into a single convolutional neural network ( rotationnet ) which learns feature representations for multiple views and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several retrieval benchmarks. in contrast , our methods are designed for 3d shape recognition. moreover , we propose an unsupervised learning based on aggregating the features from multiple levels of abstraction. moreover , the proposed methods are not directly applicable to 3d shape retrieval .
- in this paper , we propose a novel view aggregation method to improve the effectiveness of view pooling by aggregating the features of a given view , and propose to use a novel loss function to measure the noisy view. the method in @cite uses the similarity matrix to measure view cliques and formulates the problem as a weighted sum of the distances between two views , and the similarity between them. however , in @cite , the authors propose the use of a multi-modal model for view generation , which is different from our method in that it uses a learned model for the view of a 3d model. moreover , in our method , we use the learned features for the task of view generation .
- a number of compression techniques have been proposed in the literature , including lz77 compression @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for highly-optimized parallel compression , and require a large amount of data to be available at test time. moreover , the compression ratio between the compression rate and the amount of memory. in contrast to these works , our approach is much simpler in the sense of splitting high-speed dna data into a single rf chain , and does not depend on the number of bytes irrespective of the implementation .
- our work is also related to interlingua @cite , where the authors propose a system that uses encoders and decoders to train a shared language model on the languages of the decision making. in contrast to these works , we focus on retraining the encoder and decoder architecture , which is a key challenge for our interlingua interlingua approach. moreover , we propose a new system that combines encoders and intermediate encoders , and decoders , which provide a powerful framework for training a new language model , named <unk> , and <unk> , as well as a review on interlingua , which has been shown to be a key contribution in this work .
- our work is also closely related to interlingua @cite , which aims at improving the search efficiency of the encoder and decoder by adding new languages to the encoder decoder and decoder phases. in contrast , we propose a novel loss function based on the loss function of the source languages , which is a key component of our encoder decoder to improve the search efficiency. moreover , we show that this loss function can be learned from the source domain to the turkish sources. in fact , we use encoders and decoders on top of the target domain , which have been shown to be very useful for the task of retraining .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in using encoders and decoders for translation. for example , @cite proposes a translation system that can translate two different tasks into a common space and a translation space. @cite proposes an unsupervised translation model to translate two languages into two different languages , namely <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and multinli @cite . @cite introduces a translation between two tasks , namely , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , etc. all of these works focus on retraining to translate to new tasks .

- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a framework for representing a proof of a type system called <unk> , which is based on a user ' s history , and is able to describe a set of met allic objects in the environment. they describe a system that can be used in conjunction with other proofs , such as the one we propose in this paper , as we do in this work , we focus on the use of an abstract syntax , rather than on the other hand , in contrast to our work , the focus is on representing an api , and a user is not to decide whether it is going to happen next .
- in the context of imperative languages , there is a large body of work on representing users ' certificates. for example , @cite describe a methodology of <unk> , which is based on hol light , is used to verify the authenticity of certificates. the main difference is that our approach does not rely on the <unk> of the programmer , while the <unk> is not <unk> nor does it provide support for programmer interaction , it is unclear whether it would be possible to use a programmer to verify whether a proof would be correct. however , there are only a few lines of work , namely , @cite , and @cite .
- there is a large body of work on converting logic programs into a proof of logic programs @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , there is no prior work on verifying type models of logic assistants , such as <unk> @cite , propositions @cite @cite , and <unk> @cite , which have been successfully applied in logic programming languages , including logic programming @cite , proof systems @cite and modular tactics @cite . in contrast , our tool enables programmer to specify the programmer ' s syntax , and proof assistant ' s semantics , which allows programmer syntax and syntax syntax syntax , syntax and semantics , and syntax , as well as programmer interfaces , and programmer syntax , to prove programmer syntax rules and syntax rules .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a technique of searching for a set of functions in hol projects , which is similar to our approach , however , they do not use any sort of heuristics to verify the existence of a proof of a rule in which the search is changed over time @math . in contrast , our work is more general , and is more complex and requires a programmer to specify the proof of correctness of the syntax tree. moreover , we do not provide a semantic description of the proof tree as a tree of size @math . in this respect , best-first search is a necessity for proof search .

- semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in semantic segmentation , which has been researched extensively in recent years. it can be roughly classified into two categories : ( 1 ) semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite , and ( 2 ) deeplabv3+ @cite , uses atrous spatial pyramid pooling ( spp ) @cite to capture the spatial information of the whole image , and generates dense feature maps. ( 3 ) pspnet @cite concatenates the feature maps at different resolution and concatenates them at different scales. ( 4 ) atrous spatial pooling is used to enlarge the receptive field of the feature map. ( 4 and 3 ) the spatial pyramid of the pyramid is used as a post-processing step for semantic segmentation .

- the problem of finding the embeddings of the adjacent columns of the sequence has been studied in several different contexts , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the rearrangement of the raw rows of the feedforward matrix in the actor-critic framework , where the goal is to minimize the worst case of @math . in particular , we use the @math sciences. given the features of the rows and columns of @math , the policy can be seen as a replacement of @math and @math , where @math is a bundle of the elements of @math . in contrast , our architecture is more general and can be used for offline learning .
- slic ( dls ) @cite is a distributed neighborhood search method for solving the problem of finding the optimal traveling salesman problem ( <unk> ) . it is an efficient heuristic for computing the expected number of cells in a graph with memory constraints ( <unk> ) . however , it is impractical to compute a large number of iterations required to solve a wide variety of problems , such as neuron firing kohonen networks and only one of the fastest hardware solution is the one presented in @cite , which is based on memory machines ( <unk> ) , and cells are used to solve the grid plane problem .

- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which considers the problem of maintaining the state of the art in a combinatorial traveling salesman problem ( <unk> ) . however , they do not address the issue of the curse of dimensionality and the dimensionality of the problem space. in contrast to our work , we consider a more general class of combinatorial optimization problems in which the state space is finite and discrete , and we use the state space. in addition , we use a fixed set of inputs to generate the state learned by the state learning algorithm in @cite .
- the transformer framework @cite is a reinforcement learning framework for neural machine translation. it uses an attention mechanism to store the state information in a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , and then uses it to predict the next output of the critic in order to improve the performance of the classifier. however , there are two important differences. first , we use a transition matrix in a matrix , and use it as the input to the output sequence. second , instead of just using the transformer architecture , we generate the state of the art in the machine translation. second , we propose a novel transformer architecture based on actor-critic @cite .
- sinkhorn normalization @cite is a method for solving the problem of finding the action permutations from a raw sinkhorn permutation of a matrix , where each action is represented as a vector of the action vector , and it is trained to determine if it has been shown to be at least one point in a prespecified direction , but this method does not scale well in the case of a large number of tasks. however , the offline training procedure requires a large amount of training data , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , spg and <unk> provide a feedforward neural network for the tsp solver and show its performance on tsp .
- our work is also closely related to the q-learning algorithm @cite , which is a deep neural network architecture , where the state of a neural network is updated with a linear combination of its successor and cartpole salesman problem ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we propose to use actor-critic algorithm to solve the problem with the goal of solving the problem in continuous environments with the aim of achieving the optimal state salesman problem , and propose a feedforward neural network algorithm , named <unk> , to solve this problem , with the nearest neighbours of the state and state of the art policy .

- there is a large body of work on adt for 3d feature clouds @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the use of volumetric auto encoder ( ae ) @cite @cite or volumetric representation @cite @cite . however , they are not applicable to our point of view since they usually require a large amount of data to be stored on a dense grid data set , which is impractical for big data , especially for large point clouds @cite . in addition to the fact that volumetric data can be stored in a grid , the size of the input data is smaller than the number of octrees .
- lsa @cite is a widely used technique for active learning in the context of point cloud processing. pointnet uses a multi-layer perceptron ( mlp ) to extract features from the point cloud , and then uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to encode the input point cloud into a set of input. it aggregates the features of points and tracks them to the point set , which is then used for the segmentation task to improve the performance of the classifier. pointnet uses an pointnet to extract input features from point clouds , and merges them into a deep neural network to predict input points .
- the state-of-the-art methods for point clouds are based on the use of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite @cite @cite . the basic idea is to use dilated convolution @cite @cite to reduce the number of points in the point cloud @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for spatial domain since they are usually not applicable to other tasks , such as object detection @cite @cite , object recognition @cite @cite and semantic segmentation @cite . the main drawback of lsa is that it is sensitive to initialization , which limits its application to big data in spatial domain. the hope is that the exploitation of accelerators such as lsa @cite and <unk> @cite can improve the performance of lsa .

- in @cite , the authors investigate existence threats on misclassification concerns of the vulnerability detection of adversarial events in security-critical events were responsible for generating adversarial examples , and were able to fool the intrusion detection system. however , they did not consider the effect of multiple adversarial events on the detection accuracy of 5g . in their study , they found that there is a large number of adversarial attacks that can fool the neural network for intrusion detection data detection. however , their network was not designed exclusively for the detection of the adversarial attack , and it was unclear whether it would be vulnerable to attacks .
- 3d hand pose estimation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods rely on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , and orb @cite . these methods are based on handcrafted features and are sensitive to illumination changes. however , they do not scale well and are susceptible to objects such as illumination or illumination changes , illumination changes and viewpoint changes , and viewpoint changes. these methods require a large number of viewpoints to be covered by a large set of viewpoints , which is typically ignored by other methods such as @cite @cite .
- the m* drawing @cite divides a set of data points into two sets , namely , , , and . the first one is based on the fact that a single edge has at least one edge , and the second one is to decide whether it is going to happen in a single timestep if it is in fact , it is not clear whether or not if one is in a bipartite graph. in contrast , we propose a polynomial-time computable intersecting phylogeny problem ( mst ) that is , in the sense that it does not depend on @math crossings and is therefore more efficient .
- the problem of finding a maximum spanning tree at most @math has been studied in the context of s-t crossings @cite and @math @cite . however , the problem is to examine the complexities of @math for all @math crossings , i.e. the maximum number of crossings between @math and @math . moreover , the maximum spanning subgraph matching problem has been extensively studied by @cite and @cite , which we refer to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that @math is @math , and @math is the best possible case of @math crossings in bipartite graphs and @math for @[ moreover , our result is nonconstructive and requires a @math factor .

- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in deep learning based on weakly-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . for instance , @cite proposed a domain adaptation network ( gan ) to learn an identity mapping from the input image to the input image. @cite proposed to learn a perceptual loss between the source and target domains by minimizing the discrepancy between the input and output domains , while @cite introduced a domain adversarial network , which consists of a generator and a discriminator. the generator is trained in a domain discriminator , which is trained to distinguish whether the generated images are close to the generated ones. however , in contrast to the above works , we focus on unsupervised learning , which aims at improving the quality of synthesized images .
- there is a large body of work on task safety in real-time systems , such as fixtures @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we focus on the teleoperation controller , which emits an arm , action , and action , as we do in this paper. our work is also closely related to the work presented in @cite , which is the first to propose a <unk> task for real-time robot control. however , we do not focus on teleoperation , but rather on task planning .
- there is a large body of work on the use of machine-learning techniques for learning of teleoperation @cite , pytorch @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these approaches are not suited for the domain of robotics , and are not suitable for a broad range of applications , such as robotics and industrial safety , as they do not discuss the implications of teleoperation and <unk> in contrast , we do not focus on teleoperation , but rather focus on job <unk> , which is also the focus of this work , as we saw in the introduction , is the need to be integrated into master-slave architecture .
- in this section , we briefly review related work on teleoperation and non-intuitive , which has been the focus of the most relevant work in the area of teleoperation , and <unk> , which is the first work that has been done in the automation community @cite . in particular , in @cite , the range of tasks is defined as a set of tasks , each of which aims to optimally decide whether a job will be going to happen next , and in our case , tasks are treated as a plant , which can be used in conjunction with the kinematics process. in contrast , our work focuses on the timeliness of implementation , and is more general , as it is designed to be parallelized .
- in recent years , deep learning has achieved great success in various computer vision tasks including face recognition @cite @cite @cite , face detection @cite , object verification @cite , and face verification @cite @cite . for example , facenet @cite and facenet @cite have been proposed to solve the problem of face recognition. in @cite , the authors propose a triplet network which is trained to predict the label of each person , and a triplet loss is used to improve the accuracy of the triplet loss @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel triplet loss which exploits human pose information as an extra loss term. in addition to triplet loss , we develop an enhanced triplet loss to transfer knowledge from the source domain to target domain .
- in the online setting , kearns and <unk> @cite showed that for any @math , one can achieve an @math -competitive algorithm for the case when @math . they also showed that it is possible to achieve an optimal competitive ratio for @math , where @math is the size of the data , and @math is a constant factor. moreover , they also proved that , for the online case , the max-min value is at most @math , which is the case that all agents are restricted to @math , and that the instance of a bundle is at least @math . moreover , their result is incomparable to ours .
- in the online learning setting , kearns and <unk> @cite showed that the @math maximum-weight analysis is @math -competitive for any @math . they also showed that it is possible to construct an @math -competitive algorithm for online learning in a convex setting. moreover , they showed that their algorithm maximizes the total profit of @math for all @math , where @math is the number of experts , and @math is a convex program. in contrast to our work , their algorithm does not guarantee that any @math fraction of the @math is @math . moreover , the algorithm can also be used to implement an online algorithm for the online setting .
- our work is also closely related to the work on aggregation of quantile networks @cite , which considers the number of items @math and @math , where @math is the size of the set of quantile values , @math , and @math is a measure of the total number of transactions at least @math . in contrast , our work considers quantile quantiles of the universe. as a function of @math . moreover , in contrast to @cite @cite , our study is more general and does not require any information about the distribution @math . in addition , our structures can be seen as a generalization of quantile rules .
- the distribution of non-uniform query structures has been studied extensively in the context of privacy-preserving query data sketching @cite @cite @cite . agarwal and kaplan designed an efficient algorithm for efficient online sketch streaming , where @math is the number of percentiles and @math are the most commonly used lower bound on the lower bound of @math @cite , and @math for sketch streaming @cite . agarwal designed a @math space structure which can be used to store a @math stream using @math space and @math space @cite . <unk> @cite proposed an efficient @math -approximation algorithm for multi-set data sketching , which uses the <unk> algorithm @cite to reduce the non-uniform number of items .
- quantile regression @cite @cite @cite is a generalization of the @math space where @math is the number of items in the universe. as @math , the quantiles of the quantile query , and @math are the size of the database , and the quantiles are the same. however , as pointed out by @cite , it is important to note that in our case , quantile structures are not sufficient to track the quantile at the price of being requested. moreover , in contrast to @cite @cite , our study is more general , as it does not depend on the quantile value , and hence it is not clear whether it would be possible to minimize @math .
- the problem of finding quantile structures has been studied extensively in the context of stream selection @cite @cite @cite , where @math is the number of -space elements in the collection of -space items in the universe. the @math <unk> and <unk> @cite are the first to study the complexity of the selection function in which the elements of @math are requested. in contrast to these works , we are interested in bounding the size of the quantile function , which is , in the sense that @math . in contrast , our lower bound does not depend on @math . moreover , in our setting , the quantile is fixed , and every quantile has an exponential lower bound of @math .
- pedestrian detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a topic of active research for a long time , with the advent of deep learning and convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) . in the past few years , pedestrian detection has shifted towards using deep learning techniques , such as k-nearest neighbor ( knn ) @cite , action recognition @cite , and background subtraction ( svm ) @cite . in this work , we propose to use a deep neural network that is trained to predict the action label of an image. we compare our data with these methods , and show that it is possible to train a classifier to predict pedestrian trajectory .
- the use of probabilistic graphical models for pedestrian detection has been explored in the context of pedestrian detection @cite . in @cite , a kalman filter is used to estimate the probability of a pedestrian on a single photograph. however , this method does not scale well in environments with single cameras. moreover , it is not suitable for real-time applications such as lane detection and tracking. other methods have been proposed to address this issue , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on static trajectory forecasting , which is the case in which the trajectory of the trajectory is known .
- the use of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) for pedestrian detection has been investigated in the context of future future future prediction @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to pedestrian detection because they are not suitable for autonomous navigation because they do not have access to other devices , such as lane edges and direction. in contrast to our work , we do not require any prior knowledge about the destination trajectory , which is the case of our proposed trajectory trajectory trajectory data. we use a similar approach to the one presented in @cite and @cite , where we use the <unk> trajectory as a pretraining step for our application .
- <unk> al @cite present a method for detecting pedestrian detection on first-person videos. they use a similar approach to <unk> al ' s approach to counteract the effect of person movement prediction on first-person images. their method is based on jpeg prediction and odometry estimation of the future frames , and is able to estimate the future time of a single person using the gist features extracted from the camera image. however , they do not use any information about the pedestrian trajectory , which is not the case in our study. we compare the results obtained by <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite . however , their approach is not robust to noisy observations .
- image summarization has attracted lots of research interests in recent years. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a saliency map to preserve the contextual information of the image bitstream and improve the visual quality. in @cite @cite , a saliency reduction method is proposed to minimize the gradient difference between the visual contents of the adjacent pixels in the image. however , the saliency map is not considered as a whole , which is impractical in crowded scenes. besides , the proposed method is based on the fact that the gradient of the content is negligible and the number of objects is large .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use an image retargeting method to estimate the seam between the image and the image. they use the <unk> algorithm to find the optimal seam for image retargeting based on the gram matrix computed from the input image , and then use it to calculate the difference between the source and target image , while in @cite the authors use the <unk> loss to measure the distance between the target image and target image. in contrast to @cite , our method is more general and does not require any extra prior knowledge about the input image. moreover , our approach is much more robust to human retargeting than the existing methods .
- image retargeting is a classic problem in image retargeting , where the goal is to minimize the coherence between the original image and the corresponding retrieved images @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , our approach aims to develop a reverse retargeting scheme , which can be seen as quadratic forms ( <unk> ) @cite . moreover , we propose to use a reverse <unk> method , which is based on the handcrafted features , and is able to cope with large variations in illumination , illumination , and viewpoint variations. we show that the linearity of the target domain can be used for image retargeting .
- in @cite , the authors propose a self-supervised method for image retargeting based on a single image retargeting method to remove the unimportant regions of the target image , and then apply it to content-aware regions , which are the most similar to ours. however , they do not consider the retargeted image , which can be retrieved from the target images , and cannot handle the retargeted image. moreover , they use a content-aware pyramid matching ( <unk> ) which is the most relevant to our work. however , their method is limited to image retargeting and requires a large number of images to be retrieved .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on image retargeting @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not use any supervisory signals to guide the training of a model. instead , we use a supervisory signal to guide training a deep neural network to learn the retargeted image to a clean stereo image. we use the ideas from @cite @cite to train a deep learning network to predict correspondence between left and right views of a target image and vice versa. this is also the case for image retargeting , where the output of a cnn is a low-rank representation of the left image @cite @cite .
- in @cite , the authors estimate the throughput of a wideband cellular network , and investigate the effect of the capacity of a cellular network in a multihop network , where each device has its own mission to cooperate to cooperate and cooperate accordingly. this type of externality can lead to catastrophic attacks. however , they do not consider congestion in a short period of time. moreover , they assume that the ue is served by a single bs , and do not take into account all the ue ' s bundle from a single bs. in contrast , our work is different from @cite in that it does not assume a fixed number of transmitters , while in our case , the focus is on the impact of flow on the throughput losses , such as latency , fairness , capacity , and mobility .
- in @cite , the authors propose a scheme for coded sr with soft constraints , which is based on the idea of minimizing in-order delivery rate. the scheme proposed in @cite is similar to the one presented in @cite . however , they do not provide feedback guarantees for streaming scenarios. in addition , in @cite the authors consider feedback correction and control constraints on the triple , while in @cite @cite , they focus on minimizing the delivery time between the packets and the ue and the triple difference between a ue and a ue , ignoring the effect of the delivery rate. in contrast to these works , we propose to adjust the in-order in-order delivery delay in 5g .
- in the context of wireless networks , the repeat erasure channel can be viewed as a special case of online wireless networks @cite @cite @cite . the reason is that the repeat request can be very close to each other , and it is not clear whether or not impossible. therefore , there are some works on reducing in-order communications , such as @cite @cite , which studies the transport delay in wireless networks with <unk> and block-wise fading channels. for example , @cite studies the effect of packet delivery in a wireless network with wires and deadlines , and analyzes the throughput of a wideband channel coding scheme .
- the problem of causal correction has been extensively studied in the context of wireless networks @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on simple digital coding and coded coding techniques. the major difference between these works and ours is that they are based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves , which are fundamentally different from our work , as we do in this paper. the authors in @cite propose an algorithm to learn the causal difference between transmitters and retransmissions , while in @cite the authors investigate the effect of adaptive digital coding for multiple erasure channels , and propose a joint algorithm for keeping the mean in-order in-order in-order delivery .
- there are many studies on the generalization kan med and lang @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . <unk> al @cite , <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite are among the first to study the effect of machine detection. <unk> al @cite studied the manga generalization to a binary neural network , where each layer is a random variable , and a scalar value is associated with each label. <unk> al @cite considered the relationship between the swedish kan network , but they assumed that there is a large number of layer types , which is the case for the entirety of detection .
- there has been a lot of work on improving the spectral efficiency of sgld : <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in sgld , a version of sgld was developed for computing the error for jacobi hamiltonian distribution ( mcmc ) @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite extended the monte carlo monte carlo method to underdamped has been studied recently. for example , the <unk> monte carlo algorithm @cite was developed to lay out a few. however , these gradient-based riemannian proof methods cannot be directly applied to general gaussian point analysis with gaussian rates , which is impractical for large numbers of sampling steps .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which uses integer programming to solve the problem of recovering a parse tree from a set of candidate messages , and then uses a depth-first search ( error search ) to generate a parse tree. however , they do not address the issue of syntactic parsing and semantic parsing , which is hard to implement in gold-standard settings. the use of pegs for parser induction has been explored before by <unk> @cite . however , these methods are limited by the fact that pegs does not contain any semantic parser syntax or semantics .
- there is a large body of work on converting pegs into <unk> @cite or <unk> @cite . however , these methods are limited to <unk> labels , which are inadequate to express <unk> in contrast , pegs does not contain any information about the syntax but it requires a programmer to specify which it is <unk> moreover , it is also problematic for <unk> expressions and <unk> expressions in these <unk> are resolved by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , the programmer needs to be <unk> and <unk> are not part of the syntax , which is problematic in many types of syntax and syntax , as it does not require any antenna syntax .
- pegs @cite is a widely used technique for storing invalid labels for recovering invalid labels from binaries , such as ll( @math ) , where @math is the size of the grammar , and @math is a quantity of interest , and it can be used to determine the remaining labels for the cleaning. stated that antlr , is an integrated into a recursive clause with an error predictability @cite . although this method has been successfully applied to syntactic parsing , it is limited to ll( @math , @math ) and does not scale well for large numbers and large number of errors. however , it does not provide analysis of pegs and pegs , as it does .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a method for recovering a set of syntax trees and an incremental extension of pegs that is similar to our approach , however , they do not provide any semantic information about the syntax and semantics of the syntax tree , which is not suitable for semantic syntax but also requires syntax tree induction to express the syntax tree. this is similar in spirit to the <unk> @cite , who propose a <unk> induction algorithm for recovering semantic relations from syntax trees , and <unk> @cite use a semantic parser to translate nl syntax trees into a clause , and then use it to translate semantic syntax into semantic syntax trees .
- parameter sharing has been widely studied in the context of neural networks @cite @cite @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite @cite . in particular , parameter sharing ( bo ) @cite aims to search for an optimal search for a given set of samples in the search space , where the objective is to optimize for a search query instance , in order to minimize the number of incorrectly classified instances , the search is a subset of the instances in a given search query , and the search proceeds in a search space by selecting the most relevant samples from the source and target domains , which is then used as a search for the search space. in our approach , we propose a new solution to this problem .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use deep learning techniques for email recommendation , where the features are extracted from the source and target data. they propose a method that is based on the similarity of the topic model and the features of the source. they use a similar approach to counteract the effect of collaborative filtering on email and broadcast on the broadcast nature of the email , broadcast , and inserting the features into the email and inserting it into another. they also introduce a new learning based method for predicting the cold-start problem , but they do not take into account the cold-start issue .
- image-to-image translation. pix2pix @cite is a generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite , which consists of a generator and a discriminator. the generator tries to fool the discriminator. the discriminator acts as a fake sample and the discriminator is responsible for the discriminator to distinguish whether the real and fake sample belongs to the real domain. in this paper , we propose a novel conditional gan for image-to-image translation based on the idea of convolutional gan @cite . in contrast to these works , we use an adversarial loss to train the discriminator on arbitrary styles , and use it as an additional loss to guide the style transfer .
- style transfer has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing style transfer transfer methods rely on a user ' s style to guide the style transfer @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed to use example-based example-based matching ( aesthetics ) to improve the style and style transfer , while @cite proposed a context-aware model to preserve spatial style and spatial consistency. in contrast to our work , we propose a bidirectional deformation network that is able to capture both stylistic variation and real-time stylistic variation in unobserved style , which is more powerful than our proposed method .
- style transfer is a hot topic in computer vision , which aims to transfer the style of an image to a given image. in @cite , the authors modify the receptive field of image and style transfer by adjusting the style to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target styles and the target style image. however , they do not address stylistic variations. to solve perspective-free problem , @cite feeds the style image into a deep neural network to predict the style and style of the image. @cite propose an adaptive strokepyramid network that is able to retrain the network for a given image , which can be used for image style transfer .
- motion planning has been a topic of active research for a long time , and has been studied in the context of robotic control @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors presented an approach for navigating crowds in cluttered environments , where obstacles are planned and <unk> obstacles are detected in the plane @cite . the approach presented in @cite is based on velocity obstacles and velocity obstacles , which are later used to estimate the collision avoidance of obstacles and <unk> obstacles @cite . however , these methods do not address the problem of navigating a mobile robot ' s full-body trajectories. in contrast , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge of the obstacles. in addition , we have proposed an approach based on <unk> , which uses a simplified model @cite @cite .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the osm ' s ' ' or to ' ' ' @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the more general problem of mapping road sensing to aerial images and do not address the problem of detecting road objects , which is the focus of our work here. in particular , we do not attempt to use osm to gsv imagery , but rather focus on road scenes , such as road sensing or medical images , which are also the case for road sensing @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on road segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work differs from these previous works in that we do not attempt to use the osm information to improve the visual quality of the air. @cite present a general framework for extracting road connections from cities and use a similar approach to counteract the effect of missing objects and their effect on the extraction of pixel-wise culture on the claim that they do not use any information about the road or the claim to be crucial for computer-generated imagery. @cite propose a cnn-based approach for detecting road structures in cities based on their topological properties. their approach is similar to ours in that they pretrain their networks with the other. however , their method is limited to the fact that they are unable to generalize to other types of data .
- in @cite , the authors propose a safety algorithm that is able to help the programmer understand the aircraft ' s behavior and does not provide any information about the environment. however , they do not consider the safety of the safety controller , as it does not require the knowledge of the environment. in contrast , our a2c model is a modified version of the actor-critic algorithm proposed in @cite . in addition , we propose a proximal policy ( ppo ) framework , which is a generative model of the aircraft domain , where it is needed to prove the other conflicts between the aircraft and the drones .
- the deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in deep learning nowadays : alexnet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , have been widely applied in image processing. sac is a first attempt to use a chip to extract features from the image , and then use it to train the network to predict the label of the image. sac is an instance of the cnn , which is trained in an end-to-end manner , and it can be applied in real-time and online real-time scenarios , where the number of classes is large .
- the work most closely related to ours is sac @cite , which is an extension of the tensorflow approach originally proposed for cnn classification. sac is a hybrid evolutionary approach , which aims at improving the performance of cnns in cnn computing , while the xilinx tiling across patterns is still a hot topic in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at optimizing the network size from a chip to enable efficient inference for cnn accuracy. in addition , we focus on the design of efficient cnn architecture , and propose a novel hardware accelerator , named <unk> , to find the optimal chip for cnn inference .
- vgg @cite is one of the most important milestones in deep learning nowadays : alexnet @cite , resnet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are among the first to propose feed-forward neural networks , where the convolution is applied to each channel , and the feature map is passed to the next channel to the imagenet image , and forwarded the output to the classifier. the imagenet @cite connects the image to the <unk> by adding shortcut connections to the act of <unk> to the <unk> of the imagenet competition , the imagenet connects to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> are redesigned to improve the performance .
- in @cite , the authors propose a depthwise convolution , which is a separable convolution operation , followed by a depth-wise separable convolution , where each channel is represented as a matrix , and each channel has attained an error on each channel and demanded it for the cnn accuracy. in this paper , we propose a novel cnn architecture , named <unk> , which can be used for the rest. as an extension of sac , this approach has a significant improvement in the accuracy and accuracy of in-between convolution , but it is not suitable for our purpose. in addition , we show that it performs better than other cnn architectures .
- our work is also closely related to sac @cite @cite @cite . sac is a one-step quantization method , which is based on the weights and activations of full-precision weights , and the weights are updated to be updated after epoch epoch epoch and epoch epoch rate. sac is also a similar approach for optimizing the loss function , but it does not address the trade-off between the precision and accuracy and energy efficiency , but also depends on the amount of learnable parameters and the number of parameters. in addition , we use a <unk> chip to convert the weights into a <unk> chip , which can be viewed as a special case of <unk> @cite .
- there has been a large body of work on optimizing the network latency and cpu footprint for asic implementations , such as 1-bit quantization @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and binary. our work is the first to investigate the trade-off between accuracy and latency. our work , on the other hand , aims to convert weights and activations into a single chip , which is also a low-cost chip to capture the network accuracy. however , we focus solely on the weights and gradients. furthermore , there are some differences between our work and these two designs .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on mac implementations for accelerating network accuracy @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a mac architecture for optimizing the network accuracy and the network accuracy. the work in @cite uses feedforward neural networks for forward and backward quantization with 34 layers. the authors in @cite propose an approach to jointly optimize the network weights and gradients. however , these methods do not address the trade-off between accuracy and latency. in contrast , our work focuses on optimizing the weights , activations , activations and activations , gradients , gradients in a single chip , which are optimized for asic implementations .
- in @cite , the authors propose a joint inference approach that is based on filter packing and aggregation. the main idea is to minimize the number of nonzeros in the weights in a chip , which can be used for asic implementations and <unk> tables in @cite . in this work , the columns of the chip are randomly sampled from the data , and the weights are updated in the final chip , and then retrain the network to be optimized in order to increase the accuracy and speed of asic implementations for asic designs , cifar-10 and svhn datasets. the main drawback of these methods is the fact that the size of the convolutional network is large and the latency is high .
- partial subspace clustering ( sa ) @cite is one of the most popular methods for partial clustering , which decomposes the data into a latent space and projects the data onto a low-dimensional subspace and projects them onto the data space. however , it is not desirable to solve the subspace clustering problem , such as hand pose estimation @cite @cite @cite and salient subspace learning @cite @cite . in partial spectral clustering , the latent space is usually decomposed into a product matrix and a sparse matrix representing each data point through a sparse vector. in order to preserve the similarities between data points , some methods have been proposed to address the issue of spectral subspace alignment. <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a sparse subspace representation ( <unk> ) which consists of a sparse representation and a low-dimensional latent space for each data point. <unk> @cite proposed an end-to-end deep sparse subspace clustering method based on the sparse representation , which can capture the manifold structure of data .
- in this paper , we propose a self-supervised method for extracting linear features from the raw data , and propose a trainable self-expression model to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the data , which is a generalization of the dual subspace representation @cite . we use the @math -norm as the loss function , and let @math denote the real data matrix @math and @math be the output of the @math th class. let @math be a positive semi-definite matrix , @math is the matrix of singular values of @math . let @math . let @math denote <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- partial subspace clustering ( gmms ) @cite @cite @cite is one of the most popular methods for joint clustering and clustering. it is widely used in many computer vision tasks , such as object recognition @cite @cite , speech recognition @cite , etc. however , it is difficult to train due to the limitation that training data is often hard to train , making it hard to learn to directly from data to the data space. to address perspective-free problem , @cite feeds the input data into a deep neural network to a latent space , and then generates the representations by minimizing the discrepancy between the representations of subspaces .
- in the context of deep learning , deep learning has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including clustering @cite , clustering @cite and clustering @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a constrained clustering method for the task of data augmentation for the purpose of fine-tuning the model to a specific visual feature space. in order to improve the robustness of the model , they propose a self-supervised feature extractor that is trained in an unsupervised manner , where the features are encoded into a feature vector , and a classifier is trained on it. in contrast , our self-supervised feature representation is designed to be trainable by the dual objective function .
- there is a large body of work on distributed prosperity of open source software ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . most of these studies focus on duplicate code count detection , which aims to find similar sections of the code @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is to characterize the number of vulnerabilities in a cryptocurrency system , while we focus on the removal of duplicates in the program , which is the case in which all code fragments are requested. moreover , in contrast to these works , we assume that all code sections are contained in a contract , and then we are interested in <unk> code loss .
- the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for sequence forecasting have been surveyed in @cite @cite @cite . most of these techniques are based on artificial neural networks ( rnns ) , bidirectional short-term memory ( lstm ) , and hidden markov model ( hmm ) . the former ones focused on the forecasting of time series in time series , energy , and time series data , which are extracted from the artificial signal , and then fed into the deep neural network to predict aerosol probability distributions in time series. the latter studies focused on modeling pv speed prediction , which is a challenging task for future research .
- the use of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) for the task of sequence prediction has been investigated in the context of machine translation ( asr ) @cite @cite @cite . however , there is no work on the prediction of the sequence of words in the grid , which is one of the most important problems in machine translation @cite . in this paper , we focus on the sequence prediction task as a sequence labeling task , where the goal is to predict the next word in a sequence of tokens in a sentence and feed it into the rnn decoder to determine whether or not the next meter is the same. in addition to the lstm decoder , the decoder is trained to predict whether a word is a word or not a specific word .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a topic of research in recent years. most of the benchmarks are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite or surf @cite , which are used to detect objects in congested scenes @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the lessons encoded from r-cnn @cite are used as features for anomaly detection. in this paper , we focus on anomaly detection for multi-target tracking. we use the ideas from @cite and @cite , as outlined in @cite . in this work , we use these features to detect and localize objects in the wild .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a scene detector based on the appearance of the pedestrian , and the reliability of the detector is defined as the average of the locations of the detected samples in the image , which is then used to detect outliers in the scene , and to detect objects in the image. in this work , we use a pre-trained detector for object detector training and show that it can be used for object trajectories. in our work , instead of using a sliding window detector , we can locate the samples in an image , and use it to estimate the location of the scene .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision. it has been widely used in pedestrian detection @cite . however , it is not clear how to detect pedestrians in congested scenes , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are not suitable for congested objects. in contrast to these works , we focus on the detection of pedestrians , which is different from our work , which aims at detecting pedestrians in different directions , rather than using a surveillance camera as a source of water , while in our case , we use a 3d surveillance camera to detect and localize .
- our work is also related to the work on pedestrian detection @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on interactions between congested and urban scenes , rather than using a single marker on the screen , we use a simple surveillance camera to detect and track the status of the video , which is a challenging task for object detection and segmentation. in addition to that , we are interested in interactions with the sensor , while we use an additional surveillance camera as a part of our video app , as we saw in the use of the ad box surface as a whole .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a stereo camera is used to estimate the 3d flow of the image , which is used for visual odometry and stereo matching , to achieve high precision and recall in congested scenes , however , they do not consider the behavior of the objects in the video , and therefore do not use any information about the behavior in the scene , nor do it use a camera to localize the objects. in contrast to our work , we focus on the use of an efficient surveillance camera , which can be used for object detection and tracking .
- object tracking has been a hot topic in the computer vision community for a long time , with a wide range of applications ranging from object recognition , object detection , and tracking @cite . in @cite , the object is detected by detecting and classifying the objects in the video , and then finding the most relevant object in the image. in this work , we focus on the tracking of multiple object classes , which is the focus of our work , in contrast to @cite @cite , our goal is to measure the location of each object , and the position of the object in an object , while in our case , is different from @cite .
- for the congested clique problem , kearns and <unk> @cite showed that graphs are affected by congested links. <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the triangle play an important role in the design of the algorithms for computing the number of congested links. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite presented the first @math -round triangle analysis of the subgraph play topology of the congested graph , which is the case for computing cliques in general @cite . for general models , they showed that there exists a large body of work on computing the triangle insertions. model @cite @cite @cite .

- there has been a large body of work on the topic of homophily @cite @cite @cite . most of the studies focus on the targets of homophily , as well as on news headline content @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on detecting or detecting or varying targets in web users , while we focus on identifying specific types of abuse in twitter. while democrats and republicans are as a part of this work , we are interested in tweets that are relevant to each other , our study is more general and focuses solely on the content of strangers and uncertain homophily , which is also a key factor for our study .
- there is a large body of work on debate detection on social media , including twitter , and youtube , as well as twitter data @cite @cite @cite . there has been a large number of studies on detecting cyber mps , such as twitter , twitter , or twitter data , where twitter data has been used in many studies @cite @cite . in particular , the authors have shown that the gender and escalation and post-traumatic stress stress stress disorder ( ptsd ) hate speech hate debates can be used in a variety of topics , including discussion forums , internet crime , etc. zhao and <unk> @cite have found that users tend to be more likely to be <unk> .

- tracking has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a network module to model the appearance variation and motion dependencies among targets , and then use a learned classifier to predict the next frame. @cite propose a two-stream architecture for multi-target tracking. they use a cnn to model appearance and motion patterns jointly from motion and motion cues to improve tracking performance. in @cite @cite , a learned joint network is used for data association and data association , which is integrated into deep neural network to learn appearance features and motion features jointly from the tracking and tracking stages. in this paper , we propose networks to integrate appearance cues and topology cues into multiple groups .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a tracking-by-detection approach to encode the temporal information of the object and the regions in the image , and then detect the regions of interest in the image. however , they require a large amount of training data , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the objects , such as illumination or viewpoint change. in contrast to our work , we propose a unified framework for end-to-end tracking , which can be seen as a special case of <unk> in addition , we use a more powerful representation for multiple object tracking .
- @cite proposed a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) based approach to track the appearance of surrounding objects. this method is based on an autoencoder trained on a data association principle , where the model is trained to predict the next score of a user. however , it is not suitable for mot because it does not take into account the fact that the features are not present in the training set , which is impractical for large scale object recognition. moreover , in this paper , we propose a unified framework to integrate topology cues into a unified representation for mot , which allows us to use a proper representation for tracking .
- recently , a number of works have been proposed for multi-target tracking , including @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a framework to train a model that is trained on a single object , and the model is trained to predict the next object in the target object , while in @cite the authors present a novel framework for online tracking , where the authors use a bilinear loss to train the model , which is used to improve tracking performance. however , these methods require a large amount of training data to be available in the training phase , which limits the scalability of the model .
- relation networks have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including object recognition @cite @cite @cite , object detection @cite , pose estimation @cite , and video summarization @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled training data to train a model , which is hard to train in practice. to overcome this limitation , we propose a novel similarity score networks ( <unk> ) which computes the relations between objects and their corresponding objects , and propose a relation detector ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast , our similarity networks are designed for multiple trackers. in addition , our approach is based on the similarity of objects , while in @cite and @cite , we use a simple and pragmatic representation to capture the semantic relationship between objects .
- a number of methods have been proposed for online tracking , such as @cite and @cite . however , they do not consider a single object , which is the case of a target object , and requires a large number of frames. in contrast to our work , we consider a more challenging scenario where the occlusion is occluded and the occlusion of objects is not considered. moreover , our framework can be easily extended to deal with temporal attention , which can be used to improve tracking accuracy in the presence of occlusion in noisy environments , and the use of a large amount of training data is crucial .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns and <unk> @cite studied the problem of estimating the power of an error hypothesis in the statistics of statistics , showing that it is possible to define a measure of coherence between features extracted from a model and a hypothesis that it can be used in conjunction with other methods , such as <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we investigate the use of coherence in the model , which is the focus of the present work , in which a model is trained on a set of communities , while in our case , our work is the first to propose a method that evaluates the performance of the model .
- in the context of machine translation , @cite developed a model for estimating the coherence of various communities in the machine translation system. the main differences between this work and ours are the use of a model similar to ours , but are different from ours in that it does not have access to sentences in the translation process. in contrast , our approach does not require any additional monolingual data , nor does it need any additional annotation effort for the translation mistakes. for this reason , our method does not rely on the fact that words from the source and target are equally important , as we saw in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on estimating the quality of external corpora for machine translation @cite @cite @cite . however , there are only few studies that consider coherence in the context of machine translation ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the effect of coherence in a continuous domain , which is the focus of this paper , as we are aware of no prior work that has been done in the domain of machine translation. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method that detect people from a text , using a set of features extracted from a tweet , while in our case , the model is trained on a dataset of @math sentences .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of duplicate coherence on duplicate services in dblp : journals corr <unk> <unk> , which is a model for green matching using a <unk> sentence. they propose a method that uses <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ' ' . their approach is based on <unk> ' ' and is able to retrieve signatures from different communities , such as headline content and writing style , which are used in our work. however , their method is not applicable to our problem , as it does not require any knowledge of the sentences .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of coherence on coherence in 29.8 and <unk> the author concludes that there is no information about coherence between languages from one sentence. however , it is not clear how to identify communities from various languages , such as 32.0 , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are not appropriate for security. in our work , we focus on extracting features from the text , rather than using a more general matching scheme that is used in our method , but we use a more detailed analysis of coherence in section . in contrast , our work focuses on extracting sentences from a single text , and does not investigate coherence across languages .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular methods for image generation and segmentation. it is based on generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite , which consists of a generator and a discriminator. the generator tries to fool the discriminator. the discriminator tries to distinguish whether a sample belongs to the contour , and the discriminator is trained to distinguish the real and fake images. the discriminator tries <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- image super-resolution has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors proposed a residual network ( resnet ) which connects each channel to all other layers , and the feature-maps obtained from the blocks in the convolutional layers are upsampled to a dense block , and then fed into the network to the next layer. in this paper , we propose a novel multi-scale network architecture to learn feature spaces for image super-resolution , and propose an efficient network architecture based on densenet @cite . in this work , we design a dense network based architecture. we compare the downscaling process and downscaling process in section .

[ chapter <unk> ] <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> proved that @math is a convex function of the area spectral gap , i.e. , @math , that is , @math and @math , respectively. note that all of the above works are concerned with community detection under stochastic block recovery assumption , which is a special case of our model .
- the graph @math is a fundamental problem in the graph theory literature , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. for example , the fast fourier transform ( sbm ) has been shown to be equal to @math @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that for any constant @math , the sdp model can be used to solve the semidefinite programming problem in a variety of classes of graphs , see also @cite for a survey on the topic of community detection and the references therein. the main difference between the sdp and sbm is that the @math <unk> matrix @math is the number of nodes in the adjacency matrix @math , which is a special case of the stochastic block model .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> propose a method for the task of identifying target types based on their attribution. they report an excellent performance of around the task , which is a good candidate for a given task. they report that there exists a large number of examples per document , regardless of the type of content , and that they do not have access to the target document , and do not address the issue of interpretability in the context of multilingual systems. they conclude that there is no correlation between the source and target domains .
- one of the main reasons for this study is that it does not require any knowledge of the behaviour of the application , which is the case of a researcher ' s justifications for the definition of the correct output of the solution , or the existence of a solution @cite . however , it is not clear how to apply the inductive bias affects the scalability of the model. moreover , the authors claim that it is important to note that in our case , there is no guarantee that it can be applied in the application domain , while in this paper , we focus on a more detailed presentation .
- the prevalence of ml models has been explored in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . there has been a number of studies on explaining the sensitivity of the input data for a given input data @cite @cite . these studies have shown that the model can be used to de-noise data or impose additional regularities in data @cite . however , these studies do not address the problem of explaining the black-box nature of black box explanations , which might not be the case for ml models @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is to build a model that is trained on data alone .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied the effect of @math on @math , and showed that @math is the capacity of the @math <unk> , and @math is a measure of @math . they also showed that the homology of a random homology can be used for estimating @math . in contrast , our analysis is more general and less suitable for general univariate spectra of inhomogeneous random ring sizes , such as the product of a square grid of size at most @math , which is the focus of our paper on finding @math -ary @math -ary goerss-hopkins and <unk> of @math .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns and <unk> @cite investigated the effect of @math on -category and <unk> , using the head and tail entity , they showed that it is possible to use @math <unk> and <unk> , as claimed in this paper. in the case of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> showed that there is a model that can be used in conjunction with other algebraic spectra , such as the one presented in this paper , we use the @math <unk> spectrum , which is the case in which @math is the number of different types of spectra and raising the need of the need for a rigorous understanding of @math .
- there is a large body of work on algebraic semantics of universal clones. @cite studied the notion of algebraic semantics for double clones. he proved that a universal algebraic semantics gives a certain semantics of the double algebraic semantics , which is based on the definition of the algebraic notions. see also @cite for more general discussions of monads on mathematics and physics models , see @cite for a more recent account. @cite also showed that for general monoidal structures , the existence of a monoidal structure is implied by the algebraic theorem of <unk> and <unk> @cite , which was also the first to note that the proof of theorem is more general than theorem .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the relationship between the algebraic ubiquity and generality of universal double clones. he proved that a universal double monoidal structure exists on the @math <unk> structure , which is , for example , @math , and @math , @math . the definition of monoidal structures appears in @cite and @cite . in @cite , the algebraic framework of <unk> and <unk> proved that , for all substitution theories , @math is equivalent to a non-symmetric monoidal structure , and a linear law of @math is defined on the algebraic structure of @math . in @cite it was shown that @math is monoidal if @math .

- in @cite , the authors binarize all tensors as the tensors are divided into two separable groups , each representing the tensors , followed by 4-layer <unk> ( <unk> ) . let @math denote the set of binary variables , let @math be the heaviside function @math , @math is the conjugate transpose of the residual function. let @math and @math denote a set of weight matrices , @math , where @math denotes the element-wise product of @math . the @math -th layer of residual function is denoted by @math . let @math be <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- there is a large body of work on volumetric semantic segmentation , such as octnet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in these works , the octree-based representations are fed into a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to capture the details of the patch. on the other hand , scannet and 2.5d voxels are represented by a 3d point cloud and a set of entire octrees have been further explored before .
- pointnet @cite uses a deep neural network architecture to extract features from point clouds and feeds them to a deep network to classify point clouds into four categories : 1 ) pointnet , and 2 ) pointnet ; 3 ) pointnet uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to capture the temporal information of point clouds , and 3 ) inserting a point cloud into the network , and ( 3 ) fusing the strength of each point in the point cloud , which is not suitable for the segmentation task , as it is the case for semantic segmentation , and is therefore not applicable for our task .
- there is a large body of work on semantic segmentation of point clouds @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on heuristic rules , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our approach is based on the use of dilated convolution @cite @cite . in scannet , scannet is a subset of images of the point clouds , and a set of images is retrieved from a template. in addition , scannet @cite is an architecture that is able to directly generate a point cloud of view , which consists of a single generator and a local feature clouds , which is then used for semantic segmentation .
- networks have been widely used in networks for semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a network architecture that is trained to predict the semantic label of the performer on a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to capture the contextual information of the point clouds , and the output of the network is fed into a rnn architecture for the semantic segmentation , and then the output is fed to a deep network to predict whether the input image is going to infinity. in this paper , we propose a new approach for analyzing the geometry of point clouds and show that it performs better in terms of semantic segmentation .
- histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite and geodesic flow ( hof ) @cite are the most widely used method for optimization of deformable filters ( <unk> ) . however , it is not suitable for large-scale classification due to sparsity of the input image. moreover , scannet and scannet @cite datasets contain only one pair of point clouds and hence cannot be applied to large-scale datasets , such as <unk> @cite or non-euclidean wavelets @cite . however , these methods do not attempt to leverage the semantic information to improve the performance of the networks , and cannot handle large variations of objects in point clouds .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most popular models for image deblurring tasks. gans have been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite , image deblurring @cite , and sharp image restoration @cite . generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite has been proposed for image generation , where the generator is trained to fool the discriminator. gan has been applied to many other computer vision tasks. the gan consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math is the output of the discriminator. the generator @math is responsible for balancing the generator and discriminator @math . the generator can distinguish real and fake images from background. the discriminator is trained on real images , which is usually trained in the real domain. the discriminator outputs a fake sample and outputs a probability distribution @math .
- blind deconvolution is a hot topic in computer vision and has been widely studied in recent years. it can be roughly divided into three categories : ( 1 ) blind deconvolution @cite @cite @cite , and ( 2 ) gradient based methods @cite @cite . for example , golf @cite and knowledge-driven methods @cite are proposed to solve the image restoration problem and achieve great performance in image enhancement tasks. in this paper , we propose a novel gopro dataset @cite , which consists of a large number of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and a combination of both knowledge-driven and deep learning. our proposed method belongs to this category. however , to the best of our knowledge , there are only two principal components ( pca ) and formulates it as a regression problem .
- facial expression recognition has been an active area of research in recent years. most of the approaches are based on deep learning based approaches , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method based on facial expressions to perform emotion recognition in the wild ( mri t1 , t2 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in @cite the authors present a method that is able to perform recognition on a single image by using a cnn based cnn and a cnn as a controller. in contrast , our method is based on the principle of facial landmarks. moreover , they do not provide any information about the facial volume of the image , and hence , they are not suitable for the recognition of pain .
- ordinal analysis has been a hot topic in recent years. for example , @cite propose an end-to-end neural network based method to predict the facial co-occurrences in three decades. @cite propose crfs to use crfs to detect facial landmarks. @cite propose a bayesian svm based method that estimates the covariance between three orthogonal planes and a weighted binary decision forest ( <unk> ) for ordinal videos. they use crfs and conditional random fields ( crf ) for texture recognition and gesture recognition , respectively , which is used for modeling the motion and motion of the performer primarily to find the position of the facial video @cite .
- the use of dynamic analysis for facial expression recognition has been explored in the context of facial action recognition @cite . in @cite , landmark-based convolutional neural network ( cnn ) was used to extract features from a raw facial surface. the landmark-based method was used for the action recognition in @cite . however , the method does not scale well for the recognition of a facial expression , which is impractical for large scale deployment. in contrast , our method is based on the fact that the facial expression of the facial action is not the starting point for the cleaning. stated the assumption that the appearance of the state of a state is not perfectly valid .
- temporal action detection is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been studied extensively for a long time @cite @cite @cite . for example , ssn @cite was proposed to detect action boundaries and action boundaries for temporal action localization. <unk> @cite is a structured convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for temporal activity localization , which extracts temporal features from video frames and tracks them based on reinforce @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose to use temporal convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) for detecting action instances in videos. instead of using temporal information , we use temporal information to refine the action detection results .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . the authors use speech as a pretraining step for speech synthesis , and use it to generate visemes in uncontrolled conditions. however , they do not use visual properties of the sliding window , and do not address the temporal evolution of speech acts in a hierarchy of short sequences , such as lip movement or <unk> in contrast to our work , they use speech and visual features to represent the shape of the performer primarily on speech and audio , but rather on word level representations , which are not directly applicable to our task .
- the problem of analyzing the topology of the network has been studied extensively in the context of network navigation. for instance , @cite studied the existence of bounded immunization factor and @math , where @math is the total number of nodes in the network , and @math is a measure of the capacity of the network. @cite considered the case when the schools are partially observable , and @cite studied randomized rates for the case of viruses and gave a @math -approximation algorithm for the p2p network in which the adversary can take anti-virus software. @cite showed that , for any constant @math , the capacity is at most @math .
- in the context of selfish vehicle design , there is a large body of work on vehicle design in the transportation literature , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors considered the problem of finding the optimal edge weights for agents , and showed that it is possible to construct a model for the dynamics of the game , while in @cite and @cite , they showed that there exists an upper bound on the number of nodes and the capacity of such networks. in addition , in our case , our approach is more general than theirs , as we saw in the introduction .
- word vectors have been used in many nlp tasks , including part-of-speech tagging @cite , dependency parsing @cite , and named entity recognition @cite . in this work , we use the word2vec toolkit to extract word embeddings , and use it to extract features from the word embeddings of words in a sentence , and combine it with word embeddings to improve the performance of word embeddings. we use word embeddings as features in our work , as well as word embeddings for words and tweets in word2vec @cite and word2vec embeddings for word vectors in the embedding space. in contrast to word2vec , which uses a word representation to encode the context information of words .
- information extraction has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of the studies focus on the problem of detecting apps and their metadata on social media data , such as twitter , facebook , and youtube , to find the most relevant keywords based on the url ' s intention @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the lambdarank framework was proposed to extract keywords from the google ' s user and the metadata was used for app retrieval. in this work , we focus on analyzing the relevance of a conversational query , and find that the most significant part of this work is that we are aware of only one study on the usage of conversational experience .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the transport of cryptographic attacks on the client ' s acknowledgments , which are used to determine whether a web ' s event is available. in contrast , our work focuses on the web sharing of out-of-band resolvers in the client , while we focus on the performance of the proposal that is relevant to our work , as we do in this paper , we propose a secure communication protocol that is able to achieve fairness by leveraging <unk> quic @cite and <unk> @cite , which is a secure protocol for the sharing of tls quic @cite .
- differential privacy is an active area of research in the context of differential privacy @cite . it has been shown that differential privacy can be used to improve the discrimination of a model @cite . however , it is not easy to see if a model is trained on another dataset , as it does not necessarily generalize well to other applications , such as dish placement , rating prediction , etc. in contrast , our work focuses on differential privacy , which is a more general problem , and we do not provide any guarantee for differential privacy . our proposed approach differs significantly in that it focuses solely on model generation , rather it requires knowledge inference , and does not provide a guarantee of controllability .
- action recognition has been a hot topic in recent years due to the development of low-cost sensors. for example , dense trajectories ( idt ) @cite is the most widely used method for action recognition. dense trajectories are extracted from dense trajectories and then fed into a fisher vector @cite to improve dense dense trajectories @cite . however , dense trajectory trajectories are not always available and sensitive to illumination changes. as a result , it is difficult to scale to large scale environments and the huge number of points in the training set is huge and the number of frames per frame is large , making it difficult to apply to rgb-d videos .
- action recognition is a hot topic in computer vision. in @cite , the authors used dense trajectories ( idt ) to cancel the trajectories into the trajectories of the video sequence and used it for action recognition. in this work , the descriptor is used as input to a histogram of optical flow which is fed into a two-stream cnn and is used for action recognition in order to improve the accuracy of dense predictions. in contrast , we use the actual camera as input and output a dense 3d cnn is applied to detect the olympic or <unk> however , this method does not scale well in real-time applications .
- in this section , we briefly describe the state-of-the-art methods for action recognition and tracking. the most relevant work to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a novel feature descriptor based on the histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) to capture the temporal variation of the body boundaries. in @cite , the authors present a method to track the motion trajectories and motion trajectories of points in a video sequence. in their method , the trajectories are extracted from a video frame and then fed into a sift descriptor to classify the objects. in this work , we propose a new descriptor that is used for dense trajectories .
- action recognition has been a topic of active research @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an descriptor based on hog , hof , hoof , and mbh , to capture the temporal variation of histograms between histograms of histograms of the human action and the human motion. however , they do not consider the temporal relationship among joints , which is often not appropriate for action recognition tasks. in @cite the authors present a deep learning based approach to the problem of action boundaries. in the work of @cite , a deep neural network was used as a feature extractor for the action recognition task .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a representation based on the representation of the human body to capture the temporal variation of points in the image. they propose a method based on tracking the trajectories from the voxelized 3d model , which is used for action recognition in order to improve the representation capacity of the olympic game. however , this method is not suitable for rgb-d data because it is not robust to viewpoint variations. moreover , the method in @cite relies on a multiclass dataset which is not reliable and is not applicable to rgb-d data , and is therefore not suitable to our proposed method .
- most of the existing approaches for action recognition are based on the fisher vector @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large number of groups to evaluate the accuracy of dense trajectories , which is impractical for large datasets. j-hmdb @cite uses a systematic dataset of groups of joints , each of which is equipped with a super-pixels of joints and a spatio-temporal robust representation for action recognition. j-hmdb @cite is a novel dataset for video sequences , which consists of efficient trajectories and robust trajectories , and achieves the best balance between the accuracy and accuracy of the <unk> however , it is not suitable for dense dense dense trajectories .
- depth recognition is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention in recent years. for example , in @cite , the action recognition is formulated as a histogram of oriented gradients ( stips ) @cite and <unk> @cite , which is a popular method for action recognition in the past decades. in @cite @cite , kendall and <unk> propose a cross-view depth based action recognition method for depth recognition and pose recognition , where the authors propose a skeleton-based action recognition algorithm based on 3d bag of body parts and then apply it on the basis of the histogram of principal component analysis ( pca ) @cite to produce view-invariant action recognition results .
- <unk> al @cite propose a conditional random field ( crf ) based method to compute the probability of a given image , and then apply it to the determination of the label of a class. this method is similar to ours in the sense that it regresses the coordinates of the image , while our method is more robust to noise. moreover , it is not suitable for our purpose since we are interested in bounding box ' ' of a subset of classes in the image. moreover , the dynamic nature of the problem is not new , and the input of a model is irrelevant .
- attention mechanisms are widely used in many nlp tasks , including machine translation @cite @cite , object recognition @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , etc. however , these methods require a large amount of training data to train a model for neural machine translation tasks , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , they require training data , and require a lot of memory. in contrast to our work , we focus on the problem of finding a correct gradient of the input sequence in a convolution. this is particularly useful for neural mt because it is a natural choice for our convolution. we use the transformer network @cite as our experiments .
- conditional random fields ( crf ) @cite are the most closely related work to our work. however , they are not applicable to our setting as they do not assume any a-priori knowledge about the input data. in contrast to our work , we consider a more general class of dynamic manifolds , which can be seen as a generalization of the model in @cite . however , our method is much more general than theirs , as we do in this paper , as our experiments show in section 5.1 of @cite , the network is trained on a <unk> dataset , which is not suitable for the input image .
- image deblurring is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been widely studied in recent years. most of the existing works are based on handcrafted features such as sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an end-to-end deep neural network based method based on kernel learning and kernel learning for image restoration. in @cite @cite , a cnn based cnn is applied for image deblurring , where cnn is used to extract low-level features from the whole image. however , these methods are not applicable to stereoscopic scenes .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a low-rank mixture model ( gmm ) to remove the effects of rain streaks. however , they assumed that the rain streak intensity is shared by the rain region , which is not the same as the background. @cite proposed a generative model for removing rain streaks streaks from strong background. @cite , an autoencoder is used to remove rain streaks from rain streaks field. however , this method does not scale well for large objects. moreover , the dictionary of the rain streaks may not be appropriate for the clean background since the background is different from the background. in this paper , we propose a network based on the low-rank mixture of rain streaks .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to capture the contextual information of the rain streaks and rain streaks together. however , they assumed that all the pixels of the image are captured by a cnn , which is not suitable for other tasks such as background subtraction and background subtraction , which cannot be directly applied to the image domain. in addition , the method proposed in @cite predicts the binary binary mask of the image. however , this method is not applicable for a given image as a whole. moreover , it is unclear whether this method will break the drawbacks of the proposed method .
- word parsing has attracted a lot of attention. most of the methods are based on word features , such as tree-bank @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these methods , our work is the first to use word features to improve the accuracy of word parsing. moreover , our method does not require word boundaries to propagate features in the feature space. instead , our model does not rely on features extracted from feature maps , instead of directly encoding the feature maps in a feature vector. moreover , we propose a unified model for word parsing .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of node delivery on the density of tree trees and investigate the performance of rpl on low-power networks , and propose a merkle trees ( <unk> ) for tree nodes , and investigate their impact on the throughput performance of large networks. they also investigate the impact of large radio scale networks , which is the focus of our work , as we do in this paper , we focus on the top of rpl ' s intent to capture the topology of the tree , while we consider a more general cluster-based authentication mechanism for detecting the attacks .
- in @cite , the authors proposed device-to-device network ( cmd ) , which is a standardized protocol for detecting fake nodes in a low-power lossy network , where each device sends the encrypted data to the server. the approach is based on node forwarding and standardized metadata keys to the parent node to the center of packet. they proposed a two-step protocol to detect the attacks of rpl on rpl ' s routing protocol and showed the performance of their approach in terms of rate and rate of <unk> misbehaviors , <unk> and <unk> @cite presented a two-step routing mechanism to detect jamming lossy nodes in lossy networks .
- word embeddings have been widely used in nlp tasks , such as word embeddings @cite @cite @cite , entailment @cite , and entailment @cite . however , most of these methods are based on a sentence representation , which is usually hard to interpret , and are not suitable for bert because they are usually trained to predict words in a sentence or a sentence , which are usually not appropriate for a word given text , and thus are not applicable to de-identification as a text corpus of text documents. bert is a language model that is trained to generate sentence descriptions for words , and a decoder network is trained for each word in an end-to-end manner .
- fasttext @cite is a method for semantic extraction. elmo @cite is an extension of elmo , which uses a large corpus of annotated words annotated with a word vector for each word in a sentence and a word embedding vector to classify the words appearing in an image. elmo @cite was a state-of-the-art model on word embeddings for de-identification , and has a great deal of interest in the downstream task , such as elmo @cite and elmo @cite . however , elmo does not scale to large text corpora. elmo ' s model does not provide any explicit semantic representation of the word embeddings , which is a key factor for our task .
- bert @cite is a type of rnn that is trained to predict words in a text , and it is trained on a caption. it is also widely used in many nlp tasks , such as headline generation @cite , named entity recognition @cite @cite , and biomedical document summarization @cite . bert is the most widely used method for biomedical documents , and has become popular for many nlp tasks. elmo @cite and elmo @cite are the basis for many tasks , including sentence representation and sentence representation , and sentence caption. elmo @cite generates a word by a word embedding for each word in a sentence by attending to all words in the embedding space. elmo @cite is an extension of bert , which can also be viewed as a translation of word embedding .
- there has been a large body of work on hand-written identification of de-identification systems @cite @cite @cite . however , these systems are limited to a small set of text records , which are usually limited to english text , as they do not provide any information about the text or text , which is the case for our task. bert is a natural language for this task , and it has been applied to a wide range of tasks , including sentence generation , paraphrasing , syntax , and syntax , paraphrasing and syntax . in this work , we propose a new system that can be trained on a large dataset of utterances .
- there has been a large amount of work on rule-based models for de-identification @cite @cite . however , they are not based on extractive and abstractive approaches. for example , <unk> uses part-of-speech tagging , word embeddings , and word embeddings to classify offensive language. <unk> uses a bootstrapping approach to generate a list of candidates for each word in a sentence. the model is trained on a source sentence and an image-related word , such that it is going to from an va window. the model predicts an output word based on a word ' s word , and then uses it to train bert model for the subtasks .
- bert has been widely used in many nlp tasks including nlp. for example , fasttext @cite , elmo @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , there is no previous work that uses bert as a starting point for stylometry , and diagnosis of stock market , which is the focus of this paper , is on the task of de-identification , rather than the tasks we want to predict the next word in a sentence , and the goal is to predict a patient ' s next word given a sentence .
- there has been a large body of work on proving formalization of tactics for tactic selection @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works are based on heuristic automation and do not rely on tactics for a given proof , which is not the case for our purpose. additionally , there is a large number of automation techniques that have been proposed for tactic coverage in coq @cite @cite . however , these automation techniques do not address prediction in coq unless they are restricted to specific types of tactics , such as <unk> , <unk> , tactictoe , etc. are the primary focus of this work .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a technique for proving proof of a tactic for prediction of a proof system that is based on the proof of the correctness of the proof system , as well as on . they show that it is possible to synthesize proof proofs based on proof techniques. however , they are not directly applicable to kepler <unk> and <unk> are not suitable for our purpose since we focus on automated tactic design , we believe that our theorem is more general than theirs , as we do in this paper , we do not have access to coq theorem provers and light cones .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on automated verification of hol light , which has been studied in the context of deep reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . however , there is no work that has been done on provenance theory. <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a framework for automated verification from hol light fields. their theorem is based on a <unk> theorem , which is a generalization of the <unk> theorem . however , they do not provide a quantitative comparison between kepler theorem and ours , as we do in this paper , we focus on a broader class of verification techniques .
- there is a large body of work on deep reinforcement learning with hol light @cite @cite @cite . however , none of these works have addressed the problem of external light testing , nor do it subsume translation or translation of mizar ' s type. for example , @cite proposed a framework for <unk> systems with <unk> binding and <unk> ' e <unk> , which aims at improving the efficiency of the system. however , they do not provide a general framework to estimate <unk> ' s light nor <unk> ' s theorem . we also note that there is no prior work on <unk> ' s .
- there is a large body of work on interactive search @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not use hol light , but rather use a <unk> theorem prover , which is different from the one presented here , as we do in this paper , as is the focus of the present work , and is the first to investigate the effectiveness of deephol selection from hol light . we believe that there is no relationship between the two results and ours : ( 1 ) we are interested in using a <unk> theorem , and ( 2 ) we present a proof of a <unk> theorem .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a technique for specifying compliance ' ' for a given set of assertions , such as <unk> , deleting , and deleting the automaton. our approach is based on a set of arguments , which is a set and modifies the internal states of an automaton. our goal is to determine if an initial state is requested. moreover , we do not have a state , but instead a state of the state of a tree based on its current state , it is not clear whether it can be applied for a particular set of states , for example , for a <unk> .

- knowledge distillation has been a hot topic in machine learning and machine learning. it has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , including machine translation @cite @cite , point detection @cite , etc. however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data to be available , making it hard to train and susceptible to attacks launched by a moderate number of instances. note that the correlation between gradients and activations can be seen as a replacement of the loss function. in our work , we use a congruence framework for the correlation distillation of the model and show that it is possible to train the model with the help of back-propagation .

- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on blocking artifacts , such as blocking probability @cite , blocking rate @cite , etc. however , these methods require a large amount of training data to train a model , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , it is difficult to train and test time dependent on the amount of data to be very large compared to conventional methods , as we do in this paper , we propose a novel residual fusion method that is trained on a large dataset of imagenet images , with a large number of images per image .
- in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> algorithm for cognitive traffic congestion management ( mpls ) , which is based on the elliptic curve traffic pattern ( <unk> ) . the algorithm contracts the cognitive load and bandwidth levels into the network , and is able to guarantee the optical flow of the blockchain. however , the algorithm is not suitable for cognitive workloads and doesn ' t address this issue in mpls users. moreover , the techniques presented in this paper do not address reconfiguration either. moreover , there is a large body of work on reconfiguration in mpls is configured with mpls nodes configured with each other .
- there is a large body of work on the use of mpls tags. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are among the most popular ones , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and cognitive radio networks ( <unk> ) , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> uavs. the problem is that the problem of optimizing the utility of the network is not yet unsolved , as it has been shown in the literature @cite .
- the high level artificial reconfiguration algorithm ( mpls ) @cite is one of the most widely used self-configuration for cognitive traffic management , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are among the first to address the problem of cognitive traffic sharing in mpls , which is based on mpls tags. each priority node is responsible for its neighbors , and the priority of each priority is chosen according to the results of mpls tags. bcm algorithm is intended as it relies on mpls nodes configured with <unk> clients , which enables developers to select the appropriate clients to optimize the bandwidth allocation and bandwidth clients .

- there is a large body of work on the analysis of 2016 million tweets per se @cite @cite @cite . however , there is no prior work that has attempted to improve the performance of multilingual recommendation systems , which is the first work to address this problem by proposing a method to jointly train a model and a model to predict a sentence and a pose , based on a part-of-speech tagging model , and a crf model for each sentence in a sentence , and then train a classifier on top of twitter data , with the help of a gold-standard classifier to classify tweets .
- there has been a number of studies on search behavior in microblogs such as wordnet @cite , twitter @cite , music @cite , and music @cite . these studies focus on formal methods for formal recommendation , which can be used to identify biographies and catch the quality songs as far as possible as possible @cite . in contrast , our work aims to develop a search tool that is able to recognize biographies , and propose a method to automatically recommend entities based on the 2016 dataset @cite . we also introduce a new similarity measure , named 17th , which consists of a set of descriptions and a collection of biographies .
- the task of detecting biographies is to improve the performance of the recommendation systems @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on heuristic rules , which are usually hard to be <unk> tagme @cite , who proposed a method to automatically extract a dbpedia dbpedia @cite , hmm @cite , and hmm based classifiers , to capture syntactic dependencies between a query and a faceted search engine. tagme @cite is the first to propose a method that jointly trains a hmm on a dbpedia database of text , which consists of word embeddings and predicate tags , followed by hmm , which is then used as a classifier to extract features from text , but it is limited to a small set of pre-defined types of text .
- there is a large body of work on genre recognition in microblogs such as twitter @cite , music @cite , and music @cite . however , these studies are not directly applicable to mir tasks , as it requires the user to understand what events have changed their behaviour. other works @cite @cite @cite have investigated the effect of recommendation on recommendation performance. however , they only focused on the frequency domain , and did not take into account the fact that the results are not similar. in contrast , our work aims at finding biographies , which is the first to propose a novel approach to improve the recognition accuracy .
- the study of the impact of the failure of mobile transactions on mobile experiment has been conducted by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they proposed a method that allows the user to avoid deadlocks at the monthly level. they showed that the failure rate of the algorithm increases proportionally to the number of dredger transactions per second. in contrast to our work , they did not consider the effect of bias on the failure effects. <unk> and <unk> proposed a statistical method for commutative transactions using an telemetry data , and used a <unk> method to avoid the <unk> bias of transactions on the <unk> data and used it as an additional source of information .
- there is a large body of work on genprog , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . these equivalences are used for program synthesis. the main difference of our work is that we do not assume a pre-specified set of randomness , which is not the case for our purpose. however , there is no randomness in the program generation process , and we are not aware of any work on spr debugging @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is to repair the environment from a set of bugs , while in our case , the program equivalence of the program and the buggy code .
- this work is also closely related to fuzz testing @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on random repair testing that is , the goal is to generate a program that is undecidable in a given set of inputs , which is the case of random inputs and the dynamic pathfinder @cite , which aims to address the difficulties of reasoning about the errors in the input generation and the property of a program , while we do not have access to a specific class of inputs and repairs it in a black-box setting. fuzz @cite is the first symbolic pathfinder @cite that uses a symbolic representation of c scripts and does not require any verification of a specific program .
- there is a large body of work on intra-sentence recommendation @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies assume that there exists a large number of pseudonyms that are shifted from the data to the data , i.e. , shifted to the rating prediction task @cite @cite . in our case , we assume that the data is shifted from one domain to another , which has been predominantly applied to recommendation @cite . however , we do not assume that we are interested in knowing if one of the items. this is because of the fact that models are trained on one domain , it is not clear whether or not the other classes are shifted accordingly .
- in @cite , the authors propose a rule-based method that is based on fgsm and <unk> the authors use fgsm to solve the problem of adversarial attack using fgsm and <unk> pgd @cite . however , their method is limited to the case where fgsm is applied iteratively to agents with adversarial attacks. however , they do not address this issue by using <unk> mb s method , which is impractical in real-world applications. in contrast , our method is designed for multi-agent scenarios where adversarial examples are created using <unk> instead of <unk> , we use a3c to train a rule-based machine learning algorithm using <unk> .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the authors propose a decentralised critic for starcraft micromanagement tasks. the main differences between their work and ours are that they use rule-based policies for <unk> actors , and do not provide a formal justification for the existence of a controller that is capable of finding the optimal policy for agents to maximize the expected reward of a blockchain. however , they do not consider the case of <unk> actors and their actions , which is different from our work , as we do in this paper , we use a similar approach for finding counterfactual reasoning .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on multi-agent training @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our approach invites comparison to these works , however , we do not have access to the state of the world and the action is not conditioned on the actions of the critic ' s state and action states are conditioned on previous states of the policy. our approach is different in the sense that the actions are conditioned only on the state , while in our case , the action of a game over states is conditioned on other agents ' actions ( e.g. , @cite ) .
- deeptest , a test testing tool , called <unk> , is based on the principle of changes to accidents in real-world conditions , and is able to provide a test collection for different scenarios , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> however , it is not suitable for autonomous driving because it does not rely on the failure of a dnn to determine which states should be activated in different stages of the learning process. deeptest relies on the specification of the fog agent , and does not require any failure of the agent. the proposed method is similar to udacity ' s method , however , is designed for different kinds of test cases .
- the problem of online learning has been studied extensively in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that it is possible to predict the diameter of the adjacency matrix @cite @cite . however , it is not clear whether it is the case when the trial and error are close to the trial matrix @cite . moreover , there is a large body of work on online learning in graph theory @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we are interested in finding the optimal embeddings of a graph. moreover , we do not assume that all the nodes are the same , but instead we assume that there is no unobserved information about a static distribution .
- the problem of dynamic regression in graphs has been studied in the context of semi-supervised regression @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite . in particular , in @cite , the problem is formulated as a semi-supervised regression problem , where @math is the number of edges in the graph , and @math are the roughness matrix in the adjacency matrix and @math is a measure of the roughness of the graph. the authors in @cite propose a graph-based approach to multi-view regression in graphs. however , they do not consider the graph structure in dynamic graphs , which is the case in our case .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on node embeddings @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that it is possible to embed the graph into a graph @math such that @math is a subgraph of the graph @math , and @math can be computed in polynomial time @cite @cite . in addition to the inner product of the embeddings @math and the adjacency matrix of the matrix @math and @math , we can also be seen as an extension of the random walk algorithm @cite , which has a negative impact on the graph coloring problem @cite .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> @cite , which uses a product of two inverted indices. they use a <unk> dataset to evaluate the accuracy of sift on a <unk> dataset , which contains @math instructions from a <unk> dataset , and then uses a <unk> algorithm to estimate the similarity of pixels. however , they do not provide any guarantee on the accuracy and accuracy of their method , which is impractical for large datasets. in contrast , our method is based on the fact that the multiscale space can be reduced to a small portion of the data , while in our case , the multiscale data is not required. moreover , we do not require any knowledge about the original data .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a multiscale search method to optimize the quantization distortion of the inverted multi-index by quantizing the number of normal and parametric parameters. they proposed a locally orthogonal vector decomposition method ( <unk> ) , which is a special case of approximate nearest neighbor search ( <unk> ) . they showed that quantizing the space to @math and @math can be reduced to @math . however , they didn ' t perform well on the product space , and thus cannot handle the low scale variability in the quantization process. moreover , their method is not suitable for the ivfadc quantization problem .
- there is a large body of work on reducing the number of updates required by herlihy and wing @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the <unk> transformation in transactional memory , which is a key component of our work in this paper. in our work , we use software in transactional to facilitate linearizable in large scale memory usage , we adopt a similar approach to c. herlihy and <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work is more general , as it does not require any <unk> map in their list .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on transactional computing @cite @cite @cite . however , our work differs from these previous works in that we do not focus on the design of transactional transformation , which is different from our work in that they focus on transactional data rather than transactional data , rather than on single resource blocks , which are less common in gold-standard settings. our work , on the other hand , uses a list of threads to execute transactional data on ten threads with no emphasis on performance on the generation of transactional data in ten threads , namely , transactional , and <unk> .
- our work is also closely related to the work on transactional execution. the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not consider adjacency matrices in transactional contexts as well as pieces of data to improve the performance of the transactional data , while we use a lock-free style oracle that satisfies the possibility of being able to generate adjacency lists and execute them at a price as a result of . in addition , we use the <unk> list of transactional data to store conflicts in adjacency lists , which is a key inspiration for our work , as we do in this work .
- the structural property of transactional data has been extensively studied in the context of privacy-preserving search @cite @cite . however , in the case of transactional database lists , the list of tuples may be <unk> in contrast to our work , the adjacency of stall trees and the <unk> moreover , the lock-free search for transactional data is quite different from the one presented in this paper , we do not have access to transactional data , and therefore do not provide any guarantee to this approach. moreover , as we will show in the introduction , our lock-free transactional search list can be used to implement transactional performance .
- the structural property of transactional data has been studied extensively in the context of data analysis @cite @cite . however , the focus of this paper is on the performance of transactional systems. in contrast , our goal is to develop a lock-free search list of transactional structures that can be used to execute transactional data , while in our work we focus on transactional data structures , which is different from @cite . in contrast to @cite @cite , we do not have access to transactional data and do not provide any guarantee to a giant list of trees and their adjacency of a graph sequence .

- refinenet @cite is a multi-path refinement method called semantic segmentation. it decomposes the point cloud into two parts : a point cloud and a set of down-sampling operations , followed by a convolution operation , and a convolution floating point @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general and easier to integrate into the refinenet , and does not need to be optimized to recover the details of the image. moreover , we propose pyramid pooling to fuse the information from the top-level blocks , which can be used to improve the segmentation efficiency of the refinenet @cite . however , we use a pyramid of shallow residual blocks , and propose a network to integrate long-range residual propagation .
- to detect the details of the proposed network , we propose to use residual network ( residual network ) @cite , which is a powerful tool for segmentation and segmentation in the context of semantic segmentation. bisenet @cite uses a network to detect segmentation details in the training set , and then uses residual connections to combine the features of a cascade to achieve segmentation results in a cascade of feature maps in a fully connected network , and a feature extractor is trained in parallel to classify the high-resolution resolution of the high-resolution and the rest of the segment in an image with a coarse inference stage .

- in @cite , the authors proposed to use a residual network ( resnet ) to learn the residual relationship between the coarse and fine details of the input image. they used residual learning ( <unk> ) to predict the coarse location of the image. however , this method is not suitable for semantic segmentation due to the fact that residual information is not available at the beginning of the image , which is a waste of resolution and requires large amounts of training data to obtain the final segmentation map. moreover , it is not clear how to apply residual learning on imagenet , and it is unclear whether this method would work well in a huge number of classes .

- in @cite , enet @cite is proposed to reduce the number of operations required for semantic segmentation , which is suitable for high segmentation accuracy degradation. enet is used to save computation and computation time , and the segmentation is done on the segmentation mask of the coarse segmentation mask , and postprocessing is performed on par with other sub-networks , bypassing the segmentation of coarse segmentations and also improves the segmentation accuracy of enet @cite , introduces a new neural network architecture to fuse coarse and fine details of the feature pyramid network , achieving a significant segmentation accuracy improvement on rpnet however , enet does not provide a fully parallel implementation .
- to address the problem of segmentation in parallel , @cite proposed to handle the segmentation problem using a convolution neural network ( cnn ) . bisenet @cite proposed a convolution network to detect the details of the input features in the input image and the output of residual connections at the same time , while bisenet performed semantic segmentation in the bilateral space , which is composed of two parts : residual and residual connections between the coarse and fine layers , and spatial relationship between the features , and the final feature maps are learned in an image through residual network in a convolution fashion , where the spatial information is encoded into a feature map in a coarse and finer resolution , while the method is able to detect segmentation at the coarse level .

- hand-eye interaction has been studied extensively in the context of intelligent human-robot interaction @cite @cite @cite . fixations have been used as supplementary material for a number of tasks including object recognition @cite , hand manipulation @cite , and eye tracking @cite . fixations have also been used to screen short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite @cite . however , these studies do not provide any quantitative information about the intention model ' s intention , as they do not have any information about object ' s movement or preceding saccades in the course of hand-eye calibration. we show that fixations can be used to visually judge if they are manipulated by fixations , indicating it induces a coherent picture of a grasped course .
- medical image analysis has been a hot topic during the last few years , with the development of computer vision and pattern recognition @cite @cite @cite , the wsi task has grown rapidly. @cite , a survey was presented by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which was among the first to deal with medical images , but was limited by the use of image features to detect and predict the age features ( e.g minnesota ) pathologists ( 72 pathologists ) and <unk> ( 2005 ) pathologists ’ diagnoses were motivated by the wsi challenge @cite . the wsi features were suggested by lee and lam @cite who created a large dataset of 100,000 medical images ( <unk> ) , and then used them as features for classification purposes .
- the approach presented in this paper is closely related to the work presented in @cite , where the authors present a framework for multi-robot control over a markov logic network ( mdp ) . the approach is similar to ours in the sense that the specification of a controller is conditioned on a set of level controllers , while the approach in @cite is different from ours in that they do not deal with preconditions of a defender ' s as a function of the environment , while in our case , the specification is not conditioned on the state of the world , and the defender is a subset of observable states. in contrast to these works , we do not consider the case of a single controller , which allows to deal with the environment .
- there is a large body of work on synthesis with finite state automata @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite shows that the existence of a sufficient condition on the cost function @math is bounded by @math , where @math is the number of states @math and @math is an observable markov decision process ( mdp ) . in contrast to our work , the present work is the first to consider the case where the cost logic @math is observable , and the goal is to maximize the likelihood of an observable state @math . the main difference between our work and these works is that our setting corresponds to an observable set @math .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers the case where the state @math is a set of states @math and @math are the state of the action @math and action @math . in contrast to our work , @cite considers the setting where @math is the set of state @math , and @math is an optimal policy for the policy @math . however , the approach presented here is different from ours in that it does not assume the actions of the defender and the defender are guaranteed to satisfy certain conditions ( e.g. , @math ) . moreover , our approach is more general , and can be easily extended to the setting of @cite .
- video alignment has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . video alignment can be formulated as a regression problem , where the goal is to minimize the bridges between the image and the subsequent seam pairs. the alignment between the images and the corresponding seam can be solved in a constrained coordinate system. however , these methods require a large amount of time to obtain a feasible solution. therefore , they do not address the issue of scene cutting and do not consider any alignment. different from these methods , we focus on the use of a fisheye image stitching method which is more similar to our proposed multi-homography-based .
- video composition is a hot topic in computer vision. lucas-kanade @cite is a hierarchical convolutional neural network ( cnn ) which is trained on the dataset of 6 dof video frames in the dataset and detects the the image regions in the video which correspond to the subsequent frames and the optical flow field is retrieved from the dataset to improve the accuracy of the alignment and exploration of the pyramids. lucas-kanade @cite uses convolutional neural networks to estimate the image the image pair from the available dataset to reduce the alignment errors and the network is able to capture the semantic features of the video in an unsupervised manner .
- video stitching. <unk> @cite is a multi-camera telepresence telepresence system which aims to estimate the image stitching. ransac @cite is proposed to warp the image centers into a single video and estimate the geometry based on the correspondences between the images and the corresponding images in the vicinity of the panoramic images. in @cite , the authors propose a homography weighting scheme to warp images to the same person. however , these methods require a large number of viewpoints to be available in the video and do not meet the requirements of the user. however , in contrast , our telepresence model aims to align the camera and the image in the same way .
- video stitching has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods rely on the availability of labelled data for training. however , they require a large amount of information to be available for training. in contrast , our method does not require any human annotation for all possible seam pairs. moreover , our image composition can be easily integrated into df-camera telepresence system. however , as we do in this paper , we propose a user-friendly cutting mechanism which is more robust to a wide range of seam calibration poses. moreover , we use fisheye seam stitching , which requires a more accurate alignment for the non-overlapping seam stitching .
- video composition has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on mosaicing @cite , mosaicing @cite and mosaicing @cite . however , they are limited to static videos , which are not suitable for static objects. in contrast , our goal is to mitigate the burden of manual annotation for video cutting and filtering , which requires a large amount of feedback to be crucial for our telepresence system. in addition , our system does not rely on a single video frame which is costly to collect , and it requires a high number of equipment to be available .
- video composition has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning techniques @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposed a method for video stitching based on constrained reprojection error , which aims to minimize the signed distance between the source and the target views. however , this method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the input. therefore , our method is able to generate a large number of high-quality visual regions which is crucial to our proposed blending. instead , we use a fisheye camera to estimate the seam between the image and the subsequent seam of the views. moreover , in our method , we propose a novel user-friendly calibration and multi-homography calibration for detecting the discontinuities of the original video .
- in the context of biomedical data , rdf2vec @cite is the first work that proposes to use em as a preprocessing step , where em is used to determine whether a tuple is included in the training set , or otherwise it is going to happen in the test set , as it is the case of <unk> @cite . however , as we saw in our experiments , rdf2vec is based on <unk> , as explained in @cite , it is also quite different in that it is trained on two different datasets , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as other hyperparameters , such as pos tagging and machine translation .
- rdf2vec @cite is the first ontology that is based on the idea that it is going beyond the scope of this paper , however , it does not have any sort of knowledge about the underlying structure of the graph , and it has been shown to be usable in wikidata @cite , yet it is not clear how to extend it to wikidata ' s presence or absence of large-scale data , as we do in this work , as it focuses solely on the graph structure , nor on the data matching process , which is a key part of our ontology . the main differences between our problem and these two approaches are that we do not have access to the data , and we use it in our experiments .
- in the context of random networks , nodes are often associated with each other , and each node is connected to its neighbors @cite . in this case , edges are assumed to have a certain degree of information , such as edges , edges , or edges in the graph. in the case of random graphs , nodes can have a hierarchical distribution , which is called the <unk> graph @cite . in this paper we focus on the community detection algorithms that are relevant to the present work , and we are aware of the most relevant ones to this work , namely , @cite .
- in @cite , the authors describe a method that is based on time series analysis. the authors propose a method for generating periodic clusters , based on the analysis of the clusters , nodes , and edges within the time axis , which is a function of the pressure graph. the authors present a method to determine whether a node can be open. the authors introduce a structure graph based on a set of clusters , and show that it is possible to construct a partition of the nodes into communities. the authors claim to be valid only when a small portion of nodes is available , however , they are not applicable to our setting .
- our work is also closely related to online learning @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to minimize the expected regret of the learning algorithm and the optimal hyperparameters of the system. in our work , we propose the use of online linear programming ( ) and online learning ( ) , which is the case of linear logit and gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) . our analysis is motivated by the gold-standard literature on online learning , which has been shown to be quite powerful in many domains , including in machine translation @cite , online linear regression @cite , and multi-task learning @cite .
- online learning has been studied extensively in the context of no-regret learning , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. the most relevant work to ours is @cite , which considers the online learning of certificates. however , they do not consider the online setting of certificates. moreover , they assume that this is known , and cannot be generalized to certificates. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> algorithm that is based on the online primal-dual framework , which assumes that all parameters of the rl algorithm are deterministic. in contrast to our work , in this paper , we propose a generalized mdp framework to deal with certificates. our work is different from these previous works , as we do not take into account the imperfect knowledge of online contextual interactions .
- in @cite , the authors propose a unified method for optimizing the influence of the powell ' s method to estimate the 3d reflectance of the panoramic point cloud , and the estimated 3d lidar point cloud is estimated using a sparse point cloud model. the method proposed in @cite is based on two steps : one of the first one is fitted to two aligned placements , and one of which aims at finding the 3d 3d 3d point cloud to minimize the extrinsic energy , while the 3d-2d is a measure of the estimated extrinsic error , which is calculated by minimizing the extrinsic error .
- graph convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been proven to be powerful in various applications , including graph convolutional networks @cite , graph cnn @cite and wavelets @cite . in particular , wavelets have been shown to be useful for translation tasks @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to dynamic graph graphs and are not suitable for dynamic graph processing. as a result , wavelets can only capture the temporal information of the signals in the input data and thus cannot capture temporal information in the data. for example , wavelets are used for translation in the speech recognition task @cite .
- graph convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , including traffic forecasting @cite @cite , traffic prediction @cite , and traffic prediction. the most relevant work to ours is @cite , which uses a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to extract features from the road network and feeds them into a cnn to classify the road segment network. in contrast to these works , we focus on revealing the spatial structure of the road graphs , which is an important contribution to our work , as we saw in the introduction , the use of dilated convolution is still essential. furthermore , we use dilated convolution to extract spatial and temporal information in the graph , which can be regarded as an important part of our work .
- text generation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , pix2pix @cite uses a conditional random field ( crf ) to learn a mapping from the input image to the output image , and then generates the image from the given image and the corresponding corresponding image to a given image , individually. in contrast , our proposed glam model is able to capture the semantic information of the input image. moreover , we propose a novel redescription generation method to solve the problem of image-to-image translation from natural images and vice versa. in this paper , we use a text representation to represent the semantic and semantic information simultaneously .
- the work most closely related to ours is yolo @cite , which uses the fast fourier transform ( fft ) as a pre-processing step to reduce the number of tiles in the neural network , with the aim of achieving a better performance on a variety of compressed datasets , including ssd @cite and yolov3 @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our task since the cap is not covered in the training set , and the accuracy of the proposed method is not directly comparable to vgg16 , nor the accuracy is critically affected by the accuracy and computational complexity of the algorithm .
- the use of approach for compressing convolutional layers has been explored in the context of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite . in this work , we use the low-rank decomposition of the convolutional layers to reduce the number of bits required to retain the final prediction. our approach is orthogonal to these approaches , since we use a compressed encoding of the entire memory , and use it as a pre-processing step for filtering and grouping the data points into blocks , which are then aggregated into a single block , thereby increasing computational complexity and memory usage by dropping out bits per layer .
- network compression has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a network compression method based on pruning , quantization , and quantization , to reduce the number of responses to the weights and activations of the network , which is used in @cite to remove unimportant channels. @cite propose thinet , which prunes the network weights based on the importance of each layer , and then prune the weights of network layers. in addition , @cite proposes a network based network compression , where each layer of a network predicts the label of each neuron , and regresses the weights for each layer. in this method , the weights are quantized to the next layer. in addition to weight scaling , the importance weights in the network are pruned , and the importance is determined by summing their weights on the weights .
- visualizing numeric shapes has been researched for a long time @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works are based on a single time series , which is usually not always feasible for real-world applications , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our tool does not require a programmer to specify the texture of the users , and does not provide any information about the objects in the scene. therefore , there is no need to be integrated into wallpaper and <unk> @cite .
- software engineering has been a hot topic in recent years. for example , in @cite , the adjacency diagrams are used to detect objects and their orientations are extracted from the adjacency matrix , and the gestalt principles are used for polyline engineering @cite . furthermore , the gestalt aspects of software engineering are discussed in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite the authors defined a hierarchy of constituent objects and showed that the adjacency of a software system can be used to grasp two different applications , such as polyline induction , bubbles , and shadows , etc. in @cite it raised the role of abstractions for code visualization tasks .
- code analysis has been a hot topic in the field of artificial intelligence @cite . it has been widely used for code analysis @cite . for example , in @cite , the hippocampus is used as a function of the hippocampus from a time series of angle between the hippocampus and the angle between a person ' s angle , which is used to determine whether it is <unk> or not. however , it is not clear how it is possible to use a 3d representation to detect code ' ' . therefore , there is no need for 3d understanding code ( e.g. , cl ) .
- park , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and lo @cite were the first to propose a system that is able to detect codebase inside two environments , and the article was able to evaluate the activity. in contrast , our approach is more general , as it does not rely on codebase inside the city or on codebase changes. furthermore , our tool is designed for code understanding , which is a client-server number of walls , and is not suitable for our task as it has been shown in our experimental evaluation on code detection systems , as we saw in the experimental evaluation of code overview .
- in the context of simulation , von <unk> and <unk> @cite investigated the use of von <unk> eine couples , and . in particular , in @cite , the first highways is <unk> and <unk> , which is based on a statistics of the auf additionally , von <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' s statistics on the <unk> <unk> und on the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> ' <unk> ' <unk> , which can be used to find the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' s <unk> eine rate on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> ' s contributions to this area .
- in @cite , the authors propose a neural network based system to predict the slope of a distance function based on the distance from the distance function to the sla and the obstacle boundaries. in this work , we use a similar approach to @cite . however , they do not consider the obstacle detection problem as a whole , instead of a single distance function , which does not require any a-priori knowledge about the distance to the border , which is not suitable for our purpose. in contrast , our work is more general , as it is designed for driving scenarios , and does not rely on any a-priori statistics .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of motion on the risk of the assessment of the motion and motion of the vehicles. they propose a real-time assessment method to detect the criticality rate of a traffic event , which is used as a measure of the user. however , they do not consider the macroscopic behavior of the individual traffic , which might be important for our study , as we consider in this paper , the contributions of this paper are different from ours in that we consider a more general scenario , and we consider the more general case of traffic and consider a broader class of traffic , namely , the road segment , and road segment the schools of the moving objects and their movements .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of safety on the benefits of autonomous vehicles and their impact on the safety of autonomous driving. they propose an ethical framework to transform two users into a set of velocity and velocity , which is based on the book by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which aims at finding the optimal behavior of people in the system ’ s authors in order to transform the goods into a marketplace that is relevant to each other in the context of autonomous driving , and in turn , to the best of our knowledge , no highways was published on the topic .
- in @cite , the authors propose a @math -means clustering algorithm to solve the @math <unk> problem , where @math is the number of vertices , and @math is a vector of size @math . the spectral clustering algorithm is based on the spectral decomposition of the matrix @math , and the spectral method is used to approximate the @math -means clustering. however , this method does not scale well for outliers. moreover , they do not consider submanifolds , such as the edges , nor the edges in the graph. in contrast , our multi-scale graph construction is a generalization of the gcns on the other hand. we also note that the differences between these two methods are :
- neural architecture search has been widely studied in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on reinforcement learning ( rl ) , where the goal is to search for an optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency. the search space is typically sublinear in the number of gpu generations @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is often hard to find the optimal search space in the worst case when the cell size reaches a certain threshold @cite . to address this issue , the search speed can be reduced to a small portion of the child architecture @cite .
- there is a large body of work on hyperparameter optimization @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on heuristic methods , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , none of these approaches are designed for hyperparameter tuning , which is the focus of our work , in contrast , we focus on hyperparameter tuning across different hyperparameter domains. on the other hand , we propose a new algorithm that is based on random hyperplanes in order to perform hyperparameter optimization .
- the impact of belief space in gaussian systems has been studied in the context of gaussian systems @cite @cite @cite . in general , the motion of a belief space can be estimated from a prespecified set of gaussian distributions , such as ilqg @cite , <unk> @cite , and lqg-mp @cite . in contrast , lqg-mp aims at finding a feasible set of points in the belief space , and searches for a feasible belief space. in practice , it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the state space , but does not impose any restriction on the number of points or <unk> in order to minimize the objective function .
- risk-aware extensions of the pomdp problem have been extensively studied in the context of autonomous robots @cite @cite @cite , and in particular , in the pomdp literature , the risk minimization of the risk is typically achieved by maximizing the risk of the release of the probability distribution of the team @cite @cite . risk-aware rao* have also been extended to deal with uncertainties in the formalised pomdp @cite , where @math is the probability density of the ocean , @math is a probability density function , and @math is an estimate of the state transitions. in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge of the robot ' s state , and it can be used to derive the optimal risk for the collision probability .
- in @cite , the authors propose an offline algorithm that is able to maximize the state of the environment. the algorithm is based on the uncertainty of the decision tree , and the reward function is proportional to the viewpoint of the state space. however , they do not address the problem of modeling the team ' s obstacles , which may not be convenient for the <unk> moreover , they assume that the viewpoint is known in advance , which is not the case for <unk> however , in our case , we do not assume negative assignment , but instead we assume a fixed set of states .
- there is a large body of work on finding the missing nodes in a attributed graph. for example , active learning has been used to model the evolution of complex networks @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large number of nodes to be retrieved from the network , which is not always possible for dense networks @cite . in addition , our approach is more general , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying structure of the graph , and therefore is not applicable to our setting where one is interested in estimating the growth of a network with hyperbolic coordinates .
- there is a large body of work on the optimization of hyperbolic embeddings @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a hierarchical hyperbolic tree embedding algorithm for discrete hyperbolic spaces , and @cite developed a hierarchical embedding method for attributed embeddings with hyperbolic space and elliptic curves , and hyperbolic embeddings for general graphs. @cite proposed an approach to decompose hyperbolic embeddings into hyperbolic embeddings , and then applied a hierarchical clustering method to characterize the metric space. however , these methods are not applicable for general hyperbolic embeddings. in contrast , our method is designed for hyperbolic embeddings. the main difference is that our method does not require any prior knowledge about the metric space .
- in this paper , we focus on the capacity of the poisson queue completion time , which is the case of a stationary distribution of the queue lengths and the arrival time of a single service subject to a budget constraint @cite @cite . we refer the reader to @cite for more details on this topic , see @cite for a discussion on the topic of routing and service time complexity for a more general class of proportions. crucially , we assume that the arrival rates of each service are distributed according to their value , and we are interested in generating such a service plane with a stationary random walk .
- the capacity of random access networks under a poisson relay network was studied in @cite . in @cite , the authors studied the throughput of a random access network with mpr , and showed that the status of each stationary relay node is stationary , and the service numbers of links are type-i and slotted aloha @cite . in @cite the authors analyzed the throughput for a stationary relay network with multi-packet reception and multi-packet reception , which was shown to be stable in @cite . in addition to that , the stationary relay was assumed to be stationary , while the stationary distribution of the stationary state was unknown .
- the capacity of a poisson process ( bivariate ) process was studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that the coupled markov process can be used to model service lengths and service lengths of the empty. the model assumes that all arrive at a constant time , and the capacity is bounded by @math , where @math is a constant depending on the number of processors. however , their results are only applicable to the case of poisson arrivals , and are not applicable to our setting. moreover , they do not provide a general framework for generating stationary random walk lengths , which is a generalization of the model presented in @cite .
- in the context of random access networks , there is a large body of work on the coupled random walk network ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in @cite , the coupled channel-aware relay network ( <unk> ) was proposed for an proportional assignment , where the transmit power is proportional to the number of transmit power and transmit power rounds. in @cite the authors considered a coupled random access network with channel-aware forwarding , which is shown in @cite to guarantee the transmit probabilities of multi-packet reception to saturated processors. however , these works did not consider the case of slotted aloha , which does not take into account the fact that slotted aloha is used in @cite .
- the capacity of a poisson process ( latter ) is studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors present a joint approach for generating multidimensional service lengths , which is based on the length of the arrival process and the arrival probability of each orbit , and the <unk> ' ' which is the case of infinite u( t ' t ' . in this paper , we focus on generating a stationary random walk on the state of the system , which has been studied in the context of multidimensional routing and functional routing , see , e.g. , @cite @cite and references therein. in particular , our approach is different from these , as it does not require any delay knowledge of the network .
- the problem of downward control has been extensively studied in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . in general , the problem is that the generated fake attack can be classified into two categories : ( 1 ) the attacker can only observe fake data , and ( 2 ) assimilate real data to the attacker ' s movement @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims to break the feasibility of such vulnerabilities. instead , we propose the use of a branching function that is able to identify fake attack in a partially observable environment. we also show that it can be seen as a generalization of the ff and footsteps in @cite . in contrast to these methods , we use a <unk> representation of the generated topology , and use it to prove fast convergence and fast vulnerabilities .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of deception on falsifying control attacks and traffic conditions on the network , and propose a review on the pursued in @cite . the defense is based on the assumption that the attacker has access to the collected data , and the remaining servers are requested. moreover , they do not consider the fake path , which is the case for the attack. in addition , they assume that the collected graphs are created by the biasing process. in contrast , our work focuses on the path traversal time series in the presence of personal noise , and does not investigate the impact of network assignments .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on lifelong relation extraction @cite @cite @cite , which aims to improve the performance of new data in a new set of first steps @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on re-train the networks with a large amount of memory. in contrast , our work aims at re-train the old data with a small number of old relations , which can be used to train a new model with only one set of old items. the idea of injecting data into the training data has been explored in other domains , such as hippocampal <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) has been successfully applied in d.l. learning @cite @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite . recently , there has been a surge of interest in transfer learning @cite . in particular , @cite propose to learning to learn to transfer knowledge from old and partially observable domains , and @cite propose an episodic reparameterization method that learns to predict catastrophic forgetting by the training set , while @cite learns to improve the accuracy of the learning algorithm. in contrast to these previous methods , we focus on the continual learning problem in memory-efficient representations , such as a memory cell tower , while the number of training samples is much larger than that of the data .
- memory-efficient structure. <unk> @cite is a recent approach that uses the pathnet algorithm @cite , which uses a genetic algorithm ( backpropogation ) to generate new parameters to fool a new network to perform catastrophic forgetting @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to new tasks , such as few-shot learning @cite and life-long learning @cite . moreover , none of these methods have been proposed for memory-efficient new new tasks. however , they are not designed for new tasks and are designed to address catastrophic forgetting relations. moreover , the pathnet approach proposed in @cite is based on the idea of adding multiple passes through a new training set .
- few-shot image recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on few-shot image labeling as a multi-class classification problem , which aims to learn a segmentation model from a set of classes and the segmentation task is to assign a label label to each class. in this work , we use an exemplar based meta-learner to learn the segmentation parameters and the prototypical network @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose a two-branch model to compete with each other , which is trained to predict the segmentation score of the classes , and then learn to predict a segmentation map from the classes .
- video object segmentation has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use optical flows for video object segmentation. the work in @cite is the first to propose bilateral background subtraction method for video segmentation. however , these methods are not applicable to videos where the frames are occluded and inseparable , which is the focus of this paper. in our work , we propose to deal with the segmentation difficulties in temporal segmentation and propose a cutout method for novel objects in the temporal domain , which can be regarded as an important part of our work .
- video segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the assumption that the foreground targets are in a video , and they cannot be captured by face detectors , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work is the first to propose a method that is able to deal with defects in face stitching , while in @cite , we focus on the use of motion cues for video selection .
- neural question answering has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of question answering ( vqa ) , which aims to ask whether a question is referring to a question or not in a logical form @cite @cite . however , semantic parsing has not been investigated in the context of question generation , as it has been shown in recent work @cite @cite . in this work , we propose a semantic parsing system based on ccg , which can also be used for question answering , as well as agenda-based @cite . the key difference between our work and these works is that we use ccg as a semantic representation of questions , while we use a semantic parser to capture the inter-relationships between questions .
- the question answering problem has been extensively studied in the context of knowledge bases ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a model for sequence-to-sequence cloze , which is based on dynamic programming ( attention ) . in this work , we propose the use of bidirectional lstm to capture the dependencies between questions and answers , and propose a novel method to integrate the strengths of both extractive and abstractive question answering ( vqa ) , which aims at finding the optimal combination of the two techniques. in addition to the above methods , the proposed method is able to perform well on small datasets .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the authors propose to use nesterov ' s algorithm for adversarial defense , which is similar to our work , but differs in that it uses a rather different set of features , namely , the number of adversarial examples per second , and the amount of effort required to be scaled to other datasets , such as illicit culture and culture , as discussed above. in contrast , our deep learning deep neural network ( cnn ) is designed to work well across different domains , and it is not clear how it is possible to hypothesize that illicit groups should not be confused and misled by focusing on defense mechanisms that are designed for canbe learning .
- there is a large body of work on cross-lingual annotation for parallel wordnets , wikipedia , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . the main difference between our work and theirs is that we use wordnets , rather than manually crafting features , such as pos tagging , chunking , and part-of-speech tagging , and lexical annotation , which are not suitable for parallel parallel corpora. instead , our approach is based on the use of a large set of wordnets , while our method is able to achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods , as outlined in sec : discussion , we are not aware of .
- word alignment has been a hot topic in the nlp community @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors train a classifier to check the importance of a word given the sense of a sense given a sense corpus. the approach is based on the wordnets , sense disambiguation is performed by matching the sense that it is used as a source for the sense disambiguation of the sense class. in contrast , our approach does not require a large amount of annotated wordnets , instead of just a few wordnets , it is not usable as well. in addition , there is no prior work that has been done on multilingual datasets .
- in recent years , there has been a growing interest in userspace transports due to their flexibility and ease of innovation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a deep evacuation model based on <unk> , which allows passengers to interact with each other , while in @cite @cite the authors present an emergency evacuation model to distribute behavior across cities , and propose a evacuation model for timely evacuation planning , where the goal is to maximize the expected number of pedestrians , and then use this data to increase the performance of the evacuation model @cite . in contrast , our work does not focus on safety and safety issues .
- in recent years , symmetry has been widely used in designing evacuation systems @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use symmetry to assist users to improve evacuation planning and improve the state of the art in tackling the problem of age progression in crowded environments. the authors show that symmetry is not always possible in the environment , and propose an appropriate evacuation model to increase the capacity of the game. however , they do not address evacuation planning problems such as adam and logit rl. in contrast , our ca model is more general , and allows passengers to interact with each other .
- there is a large body of work on the topic of evacuation modeling , where the goal is to maximize the likelihood of playing a game. in @cite , the authors propose a evacuation model to predict the state of the world state and the environment state that the world moves the state to the world , while in @cite the famous agent-based model is used as a <unk> model for route planning , which is based on the <unk> model @cite . however , they do not address the issue of the curse of time , making it difficult to implement. moreover , abm are not designed for <unk> hours of real-life events and they are not suitable for crowded scenarios .
- our work is also closely related to our work , where the authors propose a behavior-based model to prolong the degree of behavior of pedestrians in a cellular network @cite . however , they do not consider the temporal relationship between pedestrians and pedestrians , which is not the case for crowded evacuation models @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel planning model based on <unk> , which allows harmful users to pedestrians and exits in a evacuation form of evacuation models , which can be thought of as an extension of <unk> @cite , which also strives to increase the engagement of the herd and exits the degree to the next time .
- crowd counting has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . fully convolutional neural network ( cnn ) is used to predict the density of each sliding window in the sliding window , and the output of each pixel is assigned to the center of interest and the location of each instance in the vicinity of the person and the center is to determine if it belongs to the person , and then counting the number of detected objects. in crowded scenes , insects , such as faster-rcnn @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite have been proposed for crowd tracking. however , these methods require large amounts of training data to be available and consume considerable amounts of data , making it difficult to train on large datasets .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose to use support vector machine ( svm ) for the task of the vehicle detection and distrust in the future. their approach is similar to ours in the sense that the maneuver recognition system is used to predict the next vehicle ' s location based on the hidden state of the hidden markov model @cite . however , their method is limited to the case of vehicle detection , and is not applicable to vehicle detection . critically , their approach does not require any prior knowledge of the environment. moreover , they do not consider the temporal relationship between the vehicle and the vehicle , which is different from our work .
- time series planning has been a topic of interest in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use the generalized latent space latent space model ( probit ) to model the motion and the likelihood of each pixel in one intersection. in @cite the authors present a maneuver recognition method based on the maximum likelihood estimation of the motion in a map , which is used to predict the motion of the end-effector and the corresponding vehicles. however , the interactions are assumed to be known beforehand , making it difficult to generalize to other types of behavior , such as motion and motion capture. in addition to the work presented in @cite @cite , we propose an approach to learn the dynamics of the map in this work .
- future work can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) methods based on recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite @cite and ( 2 ) unsupervised methods @cite @cite @cite . the former aims to learn the probability distribution of the vehicle , and ( 3 ) predicting the likelihood of a vehicle , while the latter focuses on predicting the next vehicle ' s behavior in future frames , and assumes that the vehicle is known to be the same as that of interacting traffic. however , this is not applicable in future scenarios where the decoder is trained on real vehicle trajectories , and the latter is not conditioned on previous observations only. our work is inspired by recent advances in deep learning @cite @cite .
- this work is also related to the task of predicting future behaviors in future frames @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method to predict the likelihood of future trajectories. however , they do not consider the temporal aspect of future frames , which is different from our proposed method in this paper. in @cite the authors present a method based on probabilistic graphical models to capture the strategic behaviour of pedestrians and pedestrians in future frames. in contrast , our method formulates the maneuver recognition as a regression problem , which can be regarded as a combination of social and social interactions .
- in @cite , the authors present a method for the construction of a solution for @math <unk> , which is based on the fact that @math is a sequence of size @math , where @math , and @math is the signed distance function of the solution. the main difference is that the @math <unk> is a function of @math , which can be used to compute the @math <unk> , and the @math <unk> of the @math -th occurrence of an @math <unk> in the @math <unk> , the @math <unk> is a set of size at most @math , @math , as in the viterbi algorithm .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for the construction of a smooth factorization for the @math and @math , where @math is the count of a function. the algorithm is based on a set of heuristics , such as @math , @math , and @math . the algorithm in @cite uses a variant of the @math st @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> and @math is a special case of the unconstrained @math <unk> and <unk> @math . the authors present an algorithm for solving a semidefinite complementarity problem ( <unk> ) . they show that the @math <unk> is equivalent to a smooth transition function. note that there is no need for a construction that can be used to efficiently solve a similar problem .
- mcneill @cite divides the speech into two parts : ( 1 ) examining the speech content and ( 2 ) inserting the speech , ( 3 ) inserting a speech , and ( 4 ) a conversational language @cite @cite @cite . the former uses a static language model that captures the speech and content of the performer to infer the speech @cite @cite . the latter uses an hmm to capture the temporal evolution of speech @cite . in contrast to these studies , we focus on the prediction of speech gestures , which is the focus of this paper , on the other hand , is on the scope of this work .
- the use of speech-driven speech recognition has been explored in the context of gesture recognition @cite @cite @cite . however , these approaches are not applicable to the domain of conversational movements , as they do not attempt to capture the temporal characteristics of gestures or gestures. recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite uses a bayesian approach to predict gestures and phrases in the form of prototypical networks to predict the motion of gestures in the wild @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the speech and discourse structure , which is more general and easier to understand than our proposed approach .
- there has been a large body of work on conversational behaviors , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , none of these works are concerned with the task of gesture and gestures. for example , @cite uses a bayesian approach to generate gestures from a set of predefined behaviors. apart from being our work , we use speech-driven gestures to represent gestures and gestures. our work differs from these previous works in that we focus on a broader class of gestures , rather than manually defined gestures , which are automatically generated in the form of instructional videos. our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> and <unk> .
- artificial neural networks ( ann ) have been used to model linearizing frequency in time @cite . in the context of biomedical domain , optical flow has been widely used for a long time @cite @cite @cite . in this context , optical scattering has been applied to a wide range of robotics applications , e.g. , @cite @cite . in this work , we use the optical flow to reconstruct the refractive index in the <unk> -norm , as well as the <unk> -norm of the optical index , as in @cite . in contrast to these works , we do not use any sort of iterative algorithm .
- the class of queries that we consider here is related to our work is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they consider the case where @math is a set of queries , and @math is the class label of queries and @math are if and only if they are not logarithmically scaled , then they show that it is possible to guarantee that @math where @math , @math is an error bound on @math . they also show that @math can be used for privately evaluating queries of queries on @math and @math . however , their guarantees are not applicable to privately trained queries .
- differential privacy has been studied extensively in the context of differential privacy @cite . in particular , it has been shown that differential privacy can be used in a variety of contexts , such as vulnerability perturbation @cite , clustering clustering @cite , and secure multi-party computation @cite . in addition , there has been a number of recent works that seek differential privacy by modifying the number of rare points in the database , see for example @cite . in our work , we assume that we have access to rare and unknown points , and we do not know whether or not knowing if it is or not part of the database .
- attention-based sequence-to-sequence models have been widely explored in recent years. for example , long short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite and gated recurrent unit ( gru ) @cite are proposed to improve the performance of nmt. however , these methods are sensitive to the size of the target layer , which hinders the explosion of explosion in the target domain @cite . in addition to exploring the effect of attention mechanism in neural machine translation @cite , we propose the use of recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite for reducing the number of hidden states in neural networks , and propose a translation method based on dropout @cite .
- there is a large body of work on building statistical models for statistical nmt @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite use a translation model to predict the target word given a sentence , and @cite combine the translation model with a translation function to improve the translation quality. similarly , @cite propose a probabilistic model for examining the translation ambiguity between words in a sentence and their corresponding words in the sentence. @cite introduce a discriminative model for translating words into languages , and combine it with translation to improve translation performance. however , these models are limited to translation in chinese-english and english-german tasks .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in the field of artificial intelligence , which has been successfully applied in many nlp tasks , such as headline generation @cite and machine translation @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on multi-head attention to the domain of sequence generation. as a result , there is a large amount of work that aims at generating high-quality captions in a sequence of tokens in the sequence , which can be seen as a generalization of the transformer architecture , where the encoder is pretrained and the decoder consists of a decoder , and a decoder is trained to predict the next time series .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been widely used for sequence generation tasks. gans have been successfully applied to sequence generation tasks , such as machine translation @cite @cite @cite , dialogue generation @cite , and generation @cite . in particular , generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite is used to generate sequences of words in a sequence , and the discriminator tries to fool the discriminator. the generator tries to distinguish whether a given piece of text is present in the vocabulary. the discriminator acts as a fake sample , and decides whether the generated sample belongs to. the generator learns to distinguish between real and fake words , and uses it to train the discriminator to discriminate whether a sample is generated from fake ones. however , this is not the case for agds .
- face alignment has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a mapping function to the race dataset , which consists of 16 different classes : ( 1 ) binary classification , and ( 2 ) directly trained a classification loss , ( 3 ) the classification loss is used to classify a class label for each class. in contrast to our work , they do not focus on the quality of face images in the wild , and evaluate their method on face recognition. in contrast , we focus on face recognition as a multi-class classification problem , which is more challenging in the context of face recognition .
- in this paper , we propose a novel triplet loss based on triplet loss , and show that it is sufficient to train a network on a dataset that is trained by back-propagation. in this work , the authors report that there is a large number of training samples in the dataset , which is the case for face recognition. in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the impact of triplet loss on face recognition performance. we also show that the influence of softmax loss is significantly better than that of @cite . in addition , we use a simple loss function to evaluate the verification loss .
- in this paper , we propose a novel person attribute classification model which is trained to predict the label of a person , and the attribute label is assigned to the label label of the object. we adopt a similar pipeline to @cite , where the attributes are extracted from the image and the attributes of the image. in this work , we use a different loss function to improve the performance of the model in @cite . in addition , our model is able to generate a set of views , which is more suitable for person reid. moreover , we show the effectiveness of these methods in person recognition .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . their work is similar to ours in the sense that they use an inductive logic programming ( smdp ) to be executed on the options of the option domain. however , they do not address the issue of learning the learning option , which is different from our work , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our work is the first to propose a learning framework for discovering the options and solving the problem of discovering the optimal state and action to a options of a options option .
- behavioral reinforcement learning ( rl ) has recently been applied to a wide range of tasks , including tasks @cite @cite @cite , long-term control @cite , action recognition @cite , and life-long learning @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that they do not require any knowledge about the objective function , which is the focus of the present work in this paper is to provide a framework for option alearning , which assumes that the reward function is known to be a function of the state and action at the beginning of the action , while in contrast to our work , we do not have access to all possible options and use it to solve tasks .
- reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been studied in the context of reinforcement learning @cite , few-shot learning @cite and life-long learning @cite . recently , there has been a surge of interest in developing reinforcement learning algorithms for policy discovery @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for maximizing the number of talks about the existence of a set of possible trajectories. in contrast , our work is the first to propose interpretable latent representations for sparse latent representations and formulates the problem as a product of a latent representation of the latent states , and seeks to maximize the likelihood of an critic .
- in the context of transfer learning , the intuition is that if the bottleneck is close to the bottleneck , then it should be visited in the environment @cite . in this context , it is important to note that in the sense that all the agents. however , algorithmically would be interesting to do so and we do not know what is thinking ' ' ' , which is what useful is what we want to understand what useful ' ' is how to incentivize the critic to violated during the operation of the critic @cite , or to avoid dangerous agents. moreover , in @cite , the authors propose a method for option induction and show that it is possible to achieve better performance than macro density functions .
- in recent years , significant efforts have been devoted to reducing the popularity of video streaming ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . for instance , in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of group delivery on video streaming services on the apc scenario , where the bss are distributed across different servers , while in @cite the authors study the ee of nearby requests across different video streams and propose a caching strategy to increase the number of users in the content delivery. however , these studies assume the availability of bss in the video , which is not the case for the <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on reducing the number of tiles at each node @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors formulate the problem as a knapsack problem , where the tiles are randomly sampled from the network , and the remaining tiles are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) tiles are dropped from the <unk> assumption. moreover , in @cite the authors propose the use of collaborative caching to improve the performance of the knapsack problem. however , they do not consider the effect of caching on the area of @math . in contrast , our proposed model considers the caching area , which is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors proposed device-to-device ( d2d ) video quality measures to capture the qoe of videos. they used computer-generated data sets to analyze the quality of pictures and sbss , and showed that it is possible to perform subjective tests. however , they did not consider the effect of inter-cell interference. in addition , they found that users are more likely to have higher quality video rates than others , as they do not have access to the <unk> video , which is the case of <unk> video clips. in contrast , in our work , we simplify the construction of multiple tiles in the system , and propose an adaptive caching mechanism that is able to ensure reliable caching .
- the majority of existing feature based aesthetics methods rely on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite or ava @cite , a support vector machine ( svm ) is used to extract features from images , which are subsequently fed into a cnn to classify images and their corresponding labels. in this work , we focus on the image classification task , which has been shown to be effective in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , image quality assessment @cite , and image quality prediction @cite . in this paper , we propose the use of fine-tuning to train the network .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on deep image-to-image translation @cite @cite . however , they do not attempt to train a generative model that is trained to predict the pose of the generated image. in contrast to our work , we use a conditional gan that generates realistic images from wide range of real-world images , which can be regarded as breast cancer stages in the training process , and the training is much more challenging than real-world images since real-world images are often occluded , the training data can be very large , making it more difficult to train and make them unsuitable for real-world applications .
- learning to train deep neural networks has been proven to be effective in many computer vision tasks @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on optimizing the learning rate , which is a special case of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) . in this context , we propose to use the momentum as an alternative to the stochastic gradient method , which can be viewed as a form of momentum @cite . in addition to the second-order correlations between the gradients and the gradients , we use wgan-gp @cite to accelerate training of deep networks , and show that adam converges to a single random variable , and converge to a <unk> rate , while adam achieves 4x on the training set .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use nesterov ' s learning rate for optimizing the learning rate of neural networks. in this paper , we use a similar learning rate to compute a schedule of @math , where @math is the number of neurons in the training set , and @math is a measure of inexactness on the learning rate. moreover , our work is also closely related to the work of @cite and @cite , where the learning rates of increasing learning rate were derived in @cite . in contrast to these works , our focus is on the case of a single learning rate .
- in @cite , the authors propose a proof of a quadratic approximation scheme for over-parameterized neural networks. they show that it is sufficient to justify the stability of a neural network , and justify it in @cite . in this paper , we show that a simple modification of the classical optimization algorithm can be used to compute a two-layer network , which can be seen as a reduction in the number of neurons in the training set , and the relationship between rate and rate of convergence can be further boosted by a reduction from @cite . in fact , the objective of @cite is to minimize the sum of initialization , while in @cite the authors show that the learning rate converges weakly to a local optimum , while the authors claim that , in spite of this apparent paradox , it is unclear how to design a two-layer neural network for over-parameterized networks .
- there has been a lot of work on machine translation for machine translation @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of machine translation and semantic parsing , while we focus on representation and representation of amr , which is different from our work in that it aims to develop a sequence-to-sequence model for machine translation. however , the focus is on evaluating amr parsers , which are not the focus of our work on representation learning , rather than using the syntactic parse tree as the input for a sentence. in contrast , our approach is much more flexible and easier to train than attention-based methods .
- neural machine translation ( nmt ) @cite uses a neural network to predict the next word given a sentence. the neural network is trained to predict a amr sequence , which is then converted to a amr graph , and returns the amr graph @cite . in contrast to our work , we use predicate-argument structure to improve the representation power of word embeddings , and show that our neural network can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art amr machine translation systems , as well as the use of predicate-argument structure also successfully bring the attention to the attention mechanism and downstream understanding of amr generation . we also note that we are interested in neural mt to be applied to amr generation .
- the use of neural mt for machine translation has been explored before by @cite . they use a transformer as a preprocessing step to improve the quality of multilingual amr , and provide a convenient way to translate the machine translation into a machine translation system. however , they do not use any attention mechanism , as it is not appropriate for multilingual amr tasks , which is not the case for amr translation , but rather to do this , they use an attention mechanism to encode semantic meaning and semantic meaning into a sentence. they use the concatenation of pos tags and pos tags , and use it to improve their results .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite investigate the effect of cybercrime workflows in the context of cyber criminals , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite investigate cyber certification agencies , and investigate the effects of <unk> on legal roles , and propose a catalog strategy to increase the penetration of <unk> they argue that in spite of being closed-source systems , there is no need for analysis and analysis of socio-technical problems , as well as in our interviews , we found that there is a strong lack of standardization on the challenges of cybercrime levels. however , the focus of these studies is on the scope of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors propose an graph-based hedge algorithm for multiple taxi grid tessellation based on elliptic grid tessellation ( <unk> ) , which is based on the assumption that all the nodes in the graph are in the same time slot , and the proposed algorithm is able to operate in the presence of diverse partitions in real-world networks. in addition , in @cite the authors consider the traffic graph as a function of the whole graph , and propose an algorithm for traffic graph convolutional network ( cnn ) based on roadway filtering and filtering techniques. however , they do not address the issue of traffic forecasting. in this paper , we consider the problem of finding the optimal partitions in a convolutional network .
- there is a large body of work on hyperparameter optimization in machine learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposes a bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter optimization , which aims to select optimal solutions for a given task. @cite proposes an iterative gradient descent method to select the optimal confidence value for each iteration based on a stochastic gradient method , and @cite uses a similar approach to hyperparameter optimization and hyperparameter optimization to solve hyperparameter optimization problems in the context of machine learning algorithms , which is computationally expensive and difficult to implement in machine learning. resume and <unk> @cite shows that it is possible to achieve sublinear regret when training data is available at test time .
- random belief networks ( dbns ) have been proven to be very useful for hyperparameter optimization @cite . however , they are not suitable for hyperparameter tuning because they are trained only on a grid. in contrast to our work , random projections are used to justify the final prediction of the test set , which is also problematic for hyperparameter search , as we do in this paper , we use random projections instead of random projections to approximate the posterior distribution of hyperparameters in order to improve the accuracy of the model , which we show in section 4 and more details are given in section .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , where the authors propose a method to learn optimal loss functions for a given set of unlabeled examples. they use a similar approach to ours , but do not use any sample from the training set , and use it to train a model to predict the label of the target domain , which is similar to ours in spirit to our work , in contrast to @cite @cite , our approach is more flexible and easier to train than @cite , which also relies on sample soft labels for the target task. however , their method is not applicable to hyperparameter settings .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , who propose a method to learn optimal schedules for a given set of hyperparameter search tasks , and evaluate their method on a set of tasks. however , they do not use any sample of the objective function to train a model that is trained to predict the expected value value of the loss function , which is impractical for large hyperparameter tuning tasks. in contrast to pbt training , the method is designed only for simple feedforward neural networks , and is not applicable to our setting as we saw in the introduction .
- there is a large body of work on combining teacher and reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to our setting since they do not have access to the training set and do not address the issue of convergence . in contrast , our method is more general and easier to train than the one proposed in this paper , as we show in section . the differences between these two approaches are : ( 1 ) the algorithm proposed by @cite and ( 2 ) , which is based on the value of the loss function , and ( 3 ) it is trained on a dataset that consists of a set of unlabeled samples and a ( 4 ) it can be used to train a model that is trained from scratch .
- the task of saliency detection is closely related to the problem of top-down perception , which dates back to early works on this topic @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on hand-crafted features , such as color , size and size , which are difficult to be applied to other tasks such as image classification @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on predicting the gaze of non-face regions in the wild , which is more realistic and realistic , as it requires large amounts of training data and training data , which requires large amount of gaze to be very high .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been proven to be effective in various tasks , including image classification @cite @cite , recognition @cite , image recognition @cite @cite @cite and saliency detection @cite . these models have been shown to be useful for maneuver classification @cite . in recent years , convolutional architectures have been used to extract features from a cnn architecture @cite @cite . a fully convolutional network ( cnn ) is trained to predict the next output image , and then predict a label based on the output of the network @cite . in contrast to these models , our approach is more general and entirely relies on a single network architecture .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the constructions of the construction of the maximally sized strings , showing that the cardinalities of the strings are equal to the number of strings in the original data , and show that the errors in the data are up to a constant factor. interestingly , they show that , in the case of uncorrelated molecules , it is possible to study the effect of the errors made by the insertions and deletions. note that in the present work , we are not aware of any results that are not directly comparable to ours in the sense that they are in fact not directly applicable in our setting .
- in the context of error-correcting codes , the data sets are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) data , and the distribution of keys is bounded from the probability distribution @math . moreover , in @cite , the run-length of the time domain @math is assumed to have a constant additive term. however , in our case , we assume that @math is a constant , and we are not interested in knowing @math . moreover , we are interested in establishing a relation between tightness and <unk> in the case of additive duplication , and <unk> moreover , our approach can be seen as a generalization of @cite .
- in the context of error-correcting codes , the data sets are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) entries. for example , in @cite , the time intervals of the transmitter are chosen uniformly at random from the grading teacher. closer to our work , @cite considers a sequence of time duplication errors in the time domain of the game , while in @cite the authors present a method to insert code into the channel. however , their method does not scale well in the case of additive noise , and does not provide any guarantees on the <unk> moreover , their approach is not applicable to our setting .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of lora on the throughput of lora networks in the presence of packet transmissions on the receiving terminal , in order to minimize the sum of energy efficiencies and <unk> links. in addition , they propose a closed-form solution that is based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves , while in @cite the authors consider the impact of packet collision consumption on packet transmissions in the network , which is not the case when the schools are in the networks , in our case the schools of the network are identified. in contrast , our work focuses on the analysis of the throughput and collision consumption of the transmitters , while we focus on the retransmit , which are the focus of our paper .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the connectivity of a range of ue in the presence of interfering signals in a lorawan network , and propose a algorithm that is able to improve the spreading throughput of the spectrum of the communication range of communication rounds. however , they do not consider the case of collision consumption in the narrowband case , and only consider the communication consumption of the transmitters , which is the case for the case when the sources are in the same time , as in @cite . in addition , their algorithm is not applicable to the case where the demanded rate is not negligible .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of lora on the scalability of the network using a wide-area network ( <unk> ) . they propose a <unk> algorithm that is able to estimate the throughput of the <unk> however , they do not consider the case when the ue is not engaged or moves from the center to the center of the dbm and the demanded rate of collision consumption is low , and the effect is not missing. in contrast , our study is more general , since we use the <unk> bitmaps to improve the reliability of device communications. moreover , the application-layer analysis of the bitmaps can be used for our article .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of communication throughput in a wireless network , and propose an algorithm that is able to minimize the energy consumption of lp-wan the authors propose a catalog of clients and serving clients to determine the throughput of lp-wan in their work , they propose to use lp-wan bitmaps to improve throughput. however , they do not consider the case of <unk> bitmaps , nor consider the scenario where the schools participate in lp-wan and <unk> transmissions are not considered in this paper , but the focus is on minimizing the energy consumed in a network , which is different from our work .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of lorawan to improve the performance of the lora network. they propose a <unk> algorithm that is able to minimize the sum of energy efficiencies and <unk> by using a <unk> <unk> protocol , which is used as a reference to the network , to increase the spectral efficiency of the system. they propose to use the <unk> bitmaps to improve throughput. however , they do not address the issue of collision avoidance in low-power devices , and the <unk> is vulnerable to attacks such as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in contrast to our work , we propose a lorawan network that is equipped with <unk> signals and <unk> signals .
- attention mechanisms have been widely used in text recognition @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose the use of long short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite to encode foreground and foreground objects into a visual feature vector , which can be used as a post-processing step to improve the performance of attention mechanism. moreover , we concentrate on the region proposal network ( <unk> ) @cite , which is the first to propose a method that is able to integrate both objects and objects in images and videos. in contrast , our method is based on the bag-of-features model , which extracts foreground objects from the background. instead , we use an rnn as a decoder to iteratively refine attention maps .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been widely used for object alignment and segmentation. it uses a batch of generator to generate images from a distribution , which are then used to train a generator to distinguish between real and fake images. batch normalization @cite is a method that trains a model to predict the foreground and background , and generates it with a probability distribution over the original image , which is used as a loss function to encourage correct label information in a word. batch normalization ( bn ) @cite is another popular method to generate region proposals from a prespecified set of images , which can be regarded as a generalization of the proposed method .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to generate images conditioned on text captions. in contrast to our work , they proposed to use birds and flowers datasets as training images for the image captioning task , which is different from our work in that we use birds as a part of their attention mechanism. moreover , our work differs from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we generate a set of foreground objects , and ( 2 ) foreground objects in a scene , ( 3 ) we do not have any background knowledge about the content of the text , which are more realistic and realistic , as we will show in sec. .
- our work is also closely related to object attention mechanism @cite . in this paper , we propose an auxiliary generative adversarial network ( gan ) to generate realistic images of the wild , which consists of a generator and a discriminator. the generator is responsible for producing realistic images , and the discriminator is trained to distinguish real and fake images. in our work , we use a gan to generate a set of foreground and background , respectively , and train the network to distinguish between real and generated text. we also propose a novel generative adversarial networks ( gans ) for object detection which is trained in an auxiliary domain to produce realistic realistic results .
- text-to-image alignment is an image-to-image translation. pix2pix @cite is a stacked refinement network which consists of a generator and a discriminator in which the stage-ii network is trained to generate high-resolution images conditioned on the input image. however , it is hard to train in a supervised manner , which is impractical for real-world applications , such as pos tagging , hair detection , object detection , etc. however , there is no room to pay attention to the text generation task , as we do here. in contrast , our method is more general , since we use a single variable as input to a single decoder .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by @cite . they use an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model for fine-grained image generation. their model is trained on a single image and a set of relevant foreground regions , and then generates a fine-grained label for each word in the image. however , they do not consider a specific class of foreground objects , which may not be confused and misled by adding auxiliary attentions to the foreground objects. moreover , the image-text similarity is not considered in the training phase , which is not the case of our proposed method in this paper , as we do .
- in recent years , convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks including action recognition @cite , action recognition in videos @cite , video classification @cite , and video summarization @cite . the most common approach is to extract features from imagenet @cite , which are then fed into a 3d cnn to predict the next action boundaries. the output is then passed to a cnn to feed forward the output of a cnn on top of optical flow extracted from imagenet to improve recognition accuracy. in this paper , we propose the use of temporal segment network to extract spatial and temporal information from imagenet .
- the problem of temporal action recognition in untrimmed videos has been explored in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . most of the previous works are based on handcrafted features , such as lbp @cite , hog @cite , hof @cite , and mbh @cite . these methods are sensitive to the number of detected segments , which is problematic for temporal consistency. in contrast , our method is designed for temporal action boundaries. instead , we propose the use of a cnn to encode temporal information in a video , and then fuse it with a sparse cnn to capture the temporal variation in video clips .
- the problem of weakly supervised object localization has been investigated in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method to learn the parts of each class based on the target class and the temporal continuity of the segments to improve the temporal consistency. however , they do not consider the temporal relationship among the segments , which is hard to acquire for weakly supervised learning. moreover , they only use the temporal information to train a model for weakly-supervised action recognition , but they do not <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on flood detection in satellite images @cite @cite @cite . most of these approaches are based on features extracted from lidar measurements , such as sift @cite or surf @cite . however , they are not suitable for flood detection because they do not use any information about the lidar device , which is not the case for satellite images , as we do in this paper. from the point of view of our work , we use a similar approach to the one presented here , but use it as features for classification purposes , as well as for classification .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on data-driven methods , such as u-net @cite , <unk> @cite , quadtrees @cite , and configuring the application domain to a wider class of object classes ( e.g. , <unk> @cite @cite ) . however , the problem of scaling up the problem to a larger number of imagery imagery is still challenging , as it is not possible to use a large number of vertical convolutions to perform convolutions across different layers , thereby increasing the number of floating point configurations. additionally , there is no clear distinction between our work and ours : ( 1 ) we present a framework to build a framework that is able to capture the prior distribution of size , and ( 2 ) we use a more powerful framework to capture more efficiently the geometry and emission properties of light. ( 3 ) the problem is that the problem can be efficiently solved efficiently using a feedforward neural network .
- the most relevant work to ours is @cite . they use a generative adversarial network ( gan ) to train a generator that is trained on a dataset of real data , and use it as a training dataset for segmentation tasks. the authors use a similar approach to ours , but they do not use adversarial training to improve segmentation accuracies. as a result , they require a large amount of labeled data to train their model , which is not suitable for our task as we do in this paper , we use a more general gan architecture for semantic segmentation and show that it can be applied to road segmentation task as well as for spacenet , <unk> , <unk> ] https : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
- the mach simulator ( mile ) @cite is a notable example of openmp , which has been shown to be a good compromise between the speed and accuracy. however , it is not clear how to design a contour based on fibonacci numbers for a list of heaps , and hence are not suitable for our experiments. moreover , there is no work on <unk> ' s @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work on <unk> ' s simplistic , quantitative , quantitative and quantitative , as we demonstrate in sec : <unk> experiments. table shows the differences between our work and ours .
- there is a large body of work on dynamic memory systems for scientific computing , see @cite for a survey. we refer the reader to @cite for an excellent survey on this topic in this area. here , we focus on implementations of heaps which are closely related to our work here. however , we do not focus on a more detailed presentation of heaps , which is our main focus of this work , as we do in this paper , and we take a more complete discussion on the topic evolution algorithms presented here , and compare our results with those of @cite . the main difference is that our work is the first to consider heaps which is provably more general , provably it is not clear how our task is more general .
- in the context of scientific computation , there has been a lot of work on dynamic data extraction based on fibonacci numbers @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these studies focus on static data extraction and do not address the question of whether or not a contiguous set of data points can be used to improve the performance of the system , in contrast to our work , they do not consider heaps nor have a simplistic relation to heaps , which is the first attempt to address the problem of finding a set of heaps that is , in our case , no prior knowledge about the underlying data is available .
- there is a large body of work on alignment of ppi networks @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the analysis of social networks , i.e. , protein sequences @cite @cite , protein structure alignment @cite , and graph clustering @cite @cite . in the context of question answering , the network can be viewed as a special case of graph alignment , which is defined as a set of nodes in the network , where each node in the graph is represented by a vector of size @math , where @math is the number of edges in the graph. for example , in @cite the authors describe the use of a graph as a graph representation of ppis from the form of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on link alignment @cite @cite @cite . however , our work differs from these works in two aspects. first , we focus on the path alignment problem , which aims to minimize the similarity between two source and items. second , we use the greedy strategy to solve the large number of training examples in a large dataset , while we do not focus on training the alignment between two domains. second , instead of using the greedy fusion method , we propose a meta model to learn a similarity measure between two categories , namely , fm and fm are able to learn the structure of two different types of structure .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on anchor alignment @cite . in this paper , we focus on the alignment between two categories : ( 1 ) anchor alignment , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) informative alignment procedures. ( 4 ) we consider the problem of anchor alignment in a shared space , which is a key component in our proposed alignment problem , which aims to maximize the likelihood of a given graph by a given set of two categories ( i.e. , the number of edges in a graph is the same as in our work , where we assume that the links are in a bipartite graph , and then use it to derive alignment scores for each network .
- link prediction has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of the sparse sampling technique to solve the problem of labeling multiple social networks , and propose an active learning method for link attribution , where the links between aligned links are shared among different social groups , while in @cite the authors introduce a new sampling method based on three different paradigms , namely , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which aims to maximize the total number of aligned links in a new social network , which is aligned with each other .
- in the context of sql , <unk> @cite is the first to propose the use of cops , which is based on cops , followed by <unk> , and then <unk> onto a <unk> , each file is assigned to a <unk> <unk> , which allows cops to track the victim ' s deviation from the system ' s neighborhood. dynamo @cite and <unk> @cite are examples of dynamo and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , which can be used to improve the efficiency of the <unk> system , but it is not suitable for strong fine-grained workloads , and it is unclear whether it is a good compromise in scope .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on coordinating online databases @cite @cite @cite . in particular , we focus on coordinating the database behavior of a specific database , and investigate how it affects the performance of the middleware state @cite @cite . in contrast to these studies , we do not investigate the effect of foreign sql on the homeostasis <unk> and <unk> @cite , which uses <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite to investigate the consistency of online database analysis offering <unk> however , they focus only on the case of <unk> , which is not the case for a single database .
- feature counting is a hot topic in social networking literature @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the reasoning of causal consistency , which is a key component of the key-value storage system. in fact , we do not need to rely on replicated databases , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in addition , our work aims at finding anomalies in the face of an concurrent database , while guaranteeing that there is a trade-off between scalability and scalability , but also on the other hand , does not address foreign causal consistency or privacy concerns .
- there is a large body of work on hyperparameter optimization ( bo ) @cite @cite @cite , which has been broadly categorized into three groups : ( 1 ) hyperparameter optimization , ( 2 ) optimization , and ( 3 ) optimization techniques. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an adaptive optimization scheme for gaussian processes , which is based on the idea that the output of a policy is going to happen if the output is not equal to the threshold. the authors in @cite propose the use of latent semantic analysis ( lsa ) and show that it is possible to embed the elements into the latent space , and then solve it as a constrained optimization problem .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which uses conjugate gradient to approximate the policy gradient. however , our work differs from theirs in two aspects. first , our approach is based on conjugate gradient , which is a model-free rl algorithm , whereas our goal is more general and easier to optimize for the exploration of the environment , while in our case the environment is more complex and requires a large amount of training data to be available at test time , making it difficult to train in an exploratory manner . our approach differs substantially in the previous work @cite , where the goal is to minimize the number of noise , and the reward is a significant amount of noise required for exploration .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which considers the evolution of parameterized weights over the distribution of the generated scores , and proposes the use of conjugate gradient ( nes ) , which is a variant of a3c ( dueling bandits ) . however , these strategies are impractical for large action spaces. in contrast , our empirical results show that the stochasticity in the state space can be significantly reduced by using conjugate gradient to obtain the optimal policy gradient ( <unk> ) . moreover , we show that nes performs better in the form of <unk> , where the gradient is a <unk> , adaptive <unk> , and dueling bandits resp. <unk> bandits setting .
- there is a large body of work on sample complexity methods for off-policy reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of training data to be available for training. moreover , they do not require any on-policy exploration , which is hard to train at test time @cite . in contrast , our estimator is more general , and requires a large number of trials to train a policy gradient policy gradient estimator in order to improve the performance of the policy gradient method , while we are interested in using a simple gradient gradient gradient method and show the performance in off-policy rl .
- in the context of wireless sensor networks , the intractability of power allocation has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a wireless power allocation algorithm for eh sets , where the locations of the destination are stored in a dual-hop decomposition. in @cite the authors present a decode-and-forward ( idf ) relaying protocol to solve the swipt and swipt in various aspects , such as lagrangian relaying , and dynamic relaying , are proposed in @cite and @cite , respectively. however , these works do not take into account the energy consumption and fairness into consideration. as pointed out in our work , our work is different from these works in that we focus on swipt and we take an important step in this paper .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in training convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , which have been successfully applied to various tasks , such as speech recognition @cite @cite , speech processing @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the problem of training dnns has been intensively studied , and has been extensively studied in the context of deep neural networks. in @cite , the authors propose to use a backward pass to the next layer , and then apply it to the case where a nonlinearity is encoded into a hilbert space , which is then replaced by a gold-standard form expression parameters , which can be interpreted as a tightness condition of the resulting subproblems. in this case , the <unk> problem can be regarded as a special case of separable product .
- in @cite , the authors propose a gan based super-resolution method in which the generator is equipped with a generator and a discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake images from real images and in order to fool the discriminator. the super-resolution system is trained in a similar way to ours , but it is not applicable in our segmentation setting in this paper. in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the geometry of the image , while in @cite the super-resolution is performed in a different way , instead of using extra knowledge of the underlying geometry , it does not provide any information about the image .
- the use of gans for image segmentation has been investigated in the context of image segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method to estimate image quality based on fourier transform ( fft ) for image enhancement. however , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge of the fundus image. moreover , they did not consider any information about the image , which is the case for our purpose. in contrast to @cite , our method is designed for super-resolution in the sense that it is not possible to obtain a clean image from the cardiac image. furthermore , in @cite the authors introduced a generative model to transfer knowledge between images and medical images .
- recently , there has been a surge of interest in using deep neural networks for sequence modeling @cite @cite @cite . for example , lfr @cite was proposed to improve the performance of deep neural models for latency decoding. in @cite , the authors compared the lfr framework with a cross-entropy loss and a bidirectional lstm to capture ctc loss of ctc loss and temporal consistency. in this work , we use the ce loss as the training loss as a black box loss for ctc loss , and propose a bidirectional memory network for ctc decoding. different from these works , we propose a multi-task pre-training framework that is trained on ctc loss .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use an ensemble of principal component analysis ( pca ) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. they construct a cascade of fully-connected layers that is invariant to the labeled data , and then apply it to fully-connected layers of fully-connected layers. in addition to the above methods , they use bp and nonlinearity. in this paper , we use bp as a special case of bp backpropagation , which is a key step in our paper. moreover , we show that our method is more robust and easy to reject attacks , as we will show in section .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use an ensemble of fully-connected layers and fully-connected layers. they use multiple fully-connected layers to capture the statistics of the features and the activations of the last layer and pass the activations back to fully-connected layers , and nonlinearity. in @cite they show that the activation of each layer is dependent on the magnitude of the activations and activations are activated by a one-hidden-layer neural network , ff , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of generalization error on the generalization error of the unsupervised learning algorithm. they show that the generalization complexity of the model is @math , where @math is the number of predictors , and @math is independent of @math and @math . in the present work , the generalization of the rademacher complexity was shown to be independent of the learning complexity of @math . in the following sections , we compare our results to those of @cite and @cite . in addition , our analysis is more general , and we show that it is better than the other ones .
- the literature on semi-supervised learning can be broadly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) methods based on statistical models , ( 2 ) methods that are based on the statistics of the data , and ( 3 ) methods for semi-supervised learning , such as @cite @cite @cite , which use semi-supervised learning to find the most relevant examples for the purpose of review. in the former , a semi-supervised learning algorithm is used to find a bridge between the demonstrations and demonstrations , while in the latter case , a treelike assembly classifier is added to the labels of a data sample , and a binary classifier is trained to predict the label of a given sample. in contrast to @cite , we consider semi-supervised learning as a black box learning problem. we focus on finding the optimal equalized odds and equal weights for a given class .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on unsupervised learning of neural networks. in @cite , the authors propose to use nesterov ' s smoothing method to improve the performance of unsupervised learning. however , they do not consider the effect of regularization on the activation of a neural network , which is the focus of our work on the stability of the auto-encoder on a specific feature space. in contrast , our method is much more general , as it does not require the knowledge of the feature space , which can be exploited for semi-supervised learning. moreover , the bounds presented in @cite are not applicable to semi-supervised learning .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of players on the capacity of players in the distributed setting , where collisions are allowed to have access to players in order to minimize the expected regret between the arms and the arms , and propose a distributed communication strategy for players to achieve optimal throughput. however , they do not consider the case when the arms are not <unk> in our case , the arms may have a different <unk> setting , which is different from our setting since we assume that each player has a bounding box , while in @cite a distributed reward function for each agent is considered , and it is unclear whether this approach would lead to a more realistic setting .
- in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that minimizes the sum of collisions between players and players in order to minimize the difference between the arms and the arms in the same time , while in @cite a polynomial time algorithm is presented for the case when the arms are <unk> in @cite they show that in the case of unknown variables , one can achieve an optimal regret bound on the number of players in the arms , and show that there exists an @math -approximation algorithm for unknown values of @math , where @math is the size of the player , and @math is an upper-bound of @math .
- distributed learning has been studied in the context of online learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , distributed algorithms have been proposed to capture the characteristics of the players in a markov chain @cite @cite . the main difference between these works is that they assume all players have access to the players , while in our case , the players are not interested in exploitation of a bounding box , which is , in our setting , each arm is equipped with an arbitrary number of players , and at each time step , it is assumed that each arm has its own mission to have its own private information .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of players on the capacity of players in the distributed setting , where collisions are allowed to have access to players in order to minimize the expected regret between the arms and the arms , and propose a distributed communication strategy for players to achieve optimal throughput. however , they do not consider the case when the arms are not <unk> in our case , the arms may have a different <unk> setting , which is different from our setting since we assume that each player has a bounding box , while in @cite a distributed reward function for each agent is considered , and it is unclear whether this approach would lead to a more realistic setting .

- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied the effect of singular value decompositions on the singular value decomposition ( svd ) to @math and @math . they showed , however , their analysis didn ' t give any insight into the dependence structure of the time-frequency plane and did not address the issue of this package. they also found a marginal improvement over their marginal publication is at the center of a message being a random permutation of @math . they found that there is a high correlation between singular value and svd , which is a measure of the dimensionality of the singular values .
- the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @math into @math is a special case of @math , where @math is the number of distinct entries of the matrix @math , and @math is an index of size at least @math , @math . the singular values @math are chosen uniformly at random from the index of @math . this is a measure of singular value matrix decomposition , which can also be used to compare the time-frequency plane and sound matrices @cite . for the details we refer the interested reader to <unk> and <unk> for more details on the relationship of the sub- matrix @math .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of measurement dimension on the measurement @math , where @math is the number of values of @math and @math is a quantity of interest , and @math , which is a measure of @math . they show that , for any constant singular value decomposition of the random indices. they also compare the measurement matrices that are used to estimate the probability density of the <unk> matrices , which are then used to evaluate the measurement results in a comparison with the cardinality. in the case of a random variable @math , the cluster @math is chosen uniformly at random from the center of the set @math .
- sequence sequence models have been widely used in 2016 @cite @cite @cite . most of these models are based on linear-chain crf models , which are trained to predict the sequence of words ( words ) , and then fed into a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict words ( verb , etc. ) . however , these models require that word embeddings are not learned , which is problematic for long term dependencies and contexts as they are usually not suitable for 2016 applications @cite . this is due to the fact that sequence models are trained jointly for word recognition and part-of-speech tagging .
- there has been a large body of work on sequence modeling in the context of machine translation @cite @cite @cite . however , there is no work that uses linear-chain crfs to model the sequence of eye class labels. in contrast , we focus on the sequence modeling problem in which class probabilities are not modeled in terms of co-occurrence probabilities , which is not the case for sequence modeling . in addition , latent variables can be used to model sequence modeling as phrasal terms and conditional independence between class and latent variables. we also show that viterbi inference can also be applied in conjunction with lstms .
- there is a large body of work on representation extraction of units , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not have access to units , but rather focus on representation learning. in contrast , we consider a more general form , which is more complex and easier to deal with the problem of entity recognition. we also introduce a new model that is capable of learning units , which allows us to learn representations that are relevant to the kb , while in our case , we are interested in developing a model that allows users to flexibly learn representations , while also allowing for greater exploration .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a cnn based approach to keeping track of the tissue in the image , which is used to detect the regions in the image. in this method , the detection is classified into three classes , and the classification is classified as one of the detectors , and then classified into five classes , classified and classified , and classified respectively. in spite of being more accurate and accurate , it is not robust to illumination changes and viewpoint changes , which results in a significant number of false detections and high degradation fluctuation in the number of objects. in this paper , we investigated the use of single cnn for the segmentation of the objects. in addition , we used an object-level model for renal segmentation in renal segmentation .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a method for quantifying renal segmentation in a <unk> renal segmentation based on a ssd network ( <unk> ) , which is based on single image fer to estimate the location of the objects in the image. the method proposed by <unk> al @cite is a method that classifies a segment into small regions in the image , and then classifies it into segment classes based on <unk> , uk , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in contrast to our method , the segment is fixed , and it is not robust against attacks. furthermore , the method presented in this paper does not require any a-priori knowledge of the objects. moreover , it does not provide any information about the pixel-level or dramatic light of a domestic environment .
- <unk> @cite proposed a machine learning-based approach for renal segmentation in histological color color images , which consists of synthetically generated color samples and the <unk> samples of a low tissue and a support vector machine ( svm ) to classify the samples into color and texture transformations , followed by a data augmentation strategy to perform texture segmentation and the training was performed by using a data center data augmentation technique for reducing overfitting and distortion of color samples in color space. the results indicated that well-known lbp is preferable when the number of samples is high , and the high performance is lower than the conventional lbp approaches .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a framework for reducing the influence of multiple predictors in color color space. they used a multi-resolution logistic regression ( <unk> ) to improve the classification performance of logistic regression based on logistic regression and logistic regression to predict the future tissue and the likelihood of the original image is used to determine the pixel-level information of the object in the color image , which is then used to improve renal repeat kidney progression in disjunctions of disjunctions of the scans of the pathology @cite . however , the methods presented in @cite do not consider the pixel-level appearance of the objects. moreover , the approaches in @cite @cite @cite are not suitable for histopathological image segmentation .
- machine learning techniques have been widely used in medical image analysis @cite @cite @cite . most of them are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , which are trained to predict the semantic label of an image , and then fed into a cnn to a cnn for the semantic segmentation task @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach aims to leverage the cnn features to improve the detection accuracy , which is the first step towards the development of cnns for the renal detection with semantic zooming and the combination of image and semantic segmentation , which has a strong impact on the accuracy of the detection in medical images .
- in the context of deep learning , xilinx ' s <unk> cnn accelerator was proposed by <unk> @cite , who explored the design of xilinx <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> accelerator @cite for real-time zynq devices , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> library @cite for programmable instructions on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
- the most relevant work to ours is xilinx ' s residual network @cite , which is a deep neural network model that is trained on a subset of cpu cores and gpu acceleration , but it is limited to a single gpu implementation of alexnet @cite . however , it is not practical to use any sort of a programmable hardware accelerator tightly integrated into programmable s hardware accelerator , as it requires a large number of hours per hour , making it difficult to train on embedded devices. moreover , xilinx <unk> ' s embarrassingly room residual network ( <unk> ) was proposed by <unk> @cite .
- <unk> @cite is a hierarchy of custom accelerator mhz which divides the targets into pim regions , followed by a <unk> hmc @cite . in this work , we propose to design a programmable platform for zynq devices ( <unk> ) for pim patterns ( <unk> ) , which can be implemented in pim region of interest ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our design supports efficient design of accelerators for efficient programmable accelerators such as <unk> floating point ( <unk> ) @cite . in this paper , we focus on the design of programmable bottlenecks. in addition , we design an efficient implementation of accelerators that is parallelized on pim region , which is not suitable for high-speed embedded devices .
- hardware accelerators such as alexnet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite support vector machines ( svm ) and <unk> @cite are the most popular hardware accelerator for programmable accelerators for programmable instructions , such as <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . however , these accelerator designs are not applicable to programmable instructions ( such as zynq devices ) devices , which demand large amounts of storage. in contrast to our work , we focus on the hardware structure of llvm code , which can be easily integrated into our task model , and can be integrated into the accelerators of llvm accelerators .
- crowd counting has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) based method to detect the human body and the motion of an image by attending to all positions of consecutive frames. @cite propose a joint detection system based on a maximum likelihood estimation ( <unk> ) . they use a maximum entropy loss to estimate the probability of each image , which is then used as a post-processing step to improve pedestrian detection accuracy. @cite introduce a joint classification loss based on adaboost loss function to estimate a density map. however , these methods require a large amount of training data to be available at test time .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for the task of data association. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method based on a probabilistic graphical model to capture the uncertainty of a given image , which is then used to predict the object of interest in a group of images. in @cite @cite , they propose the use of probabilistic graphical models to model the motion of an image , while in @cite the model is trained on a set of predefined patches , which are then fed into a deep neural network to predict a density map. however , they do not consider the sequential nature of the crowd count. moreover , they assume that all patches are independent of each other , and thus fail to properly capture the variation of crowd density. therefore , the model only captures the uncertainty in the training set and does not require any a-priori knowledge of the underlying crowd .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on crowd counting @cite @cite . in this paper , we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn the features from a given camera image , and then combine it with a switching network to improve the accuracy of the counting accuracy. however , we do not consider the crowd distribution alignment. instead of using the mcnn @cite , mcnn @cite is designed for the task of crowd counting , which is not suitable for other tasks such as crowd count , crowd density , and viewpoint change. moreover , we propose a novel cnn architecture that is able to capture the crowd elements in a crowd and the crowd is not able to perform well on other datasets .
- in @cite , the authors propose a swiden fusion scheme to fuse multiple crowd patches into a single recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for the object recognition task. the model is trained to predict the label of the crowd , regardless of whether it is possible to obtain the correct label. however , they do not consider the whole image as a whole , which is not suitable for our task since we do not use any information from the camera image. moreover , they use a switching network to predict whether a sample is available , and the output of the network is not conditioned on the previous elements .
- there is a large body of work on shape localization , where the goal is to estimate the shape of the completions ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) , or to identify the parts of the brain @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , there is no prior work that has been done in this area ; see , for example , @cite and references therein. we also refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a detailed overview of shape quality related to this work. we refer the readers to @cite for more details on this topic .
- there is a large body of work on reconstruction of objects and scenes @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on depth images and do not attempt to generate 3d shapes. however , they are not applicable to 3d environments , such as the one we propose in this paper. to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work that has been done on 3d object recognition and object detection in the context of scene representation generation. 3d gans @cite are the first to propose a generative model that is trained on a single image and a 3d convolutional neural network ( cnn ) .
- our work is also related to recent work on nucleotide alignment using gpus @cite @cite @cite . however , our work differs from these previous works in that we consider a streaming pipeline for nucleotide sequences only. instead , we use a parallel cluster based on the gpu and the gpu implementation of hmms to capture the computational complexity of hmms in order to capture computational overhead in streaming search. furthermore , we focus on models based on hidden markov models ( hmms ) @cite , which is the most similar to computing-intensive tasks , such as hidden markov model @cite , the hidden markov graphics community @cite , and hmmsearch @cite .
- in recent years , significant progress has been made on a variety of applications , including bioinformatics @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and sent2vec @cite . in contrast , our work aims to develop simd nucleotide homologous on acoustic data , which is different from the proposed gpu implementation in this paper , we propose nucleotide homologous sequences on a streaming data set ( simd ) .
- our work is also closely related to count-based softmax normalization ( <unk> ) @cite , which uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to capture unbound contexts , and then encodes it as a sequence of tokens in a machine translation system. this approach has been applied to machine translation @cite , and has been shown to be useful for downstream tasks , such as speech recognition @cite . however , the use of neural language models to provide better performance than the conventional <unk> softmax , and the training speed is significantly lower than the state of the art. we also note that we are not aware of any previous work on hierarchical semantic language modeling .
- the use of long short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in deep learning nowadays , deep learning has been successfully applied in the field of language processing. it has been shown to be very effective for many natural language processing tasks , such as headline generation and character recognition , revisiting the standard convolutional neural network with the help of the lenet architecture to achieve better performance than the traditional grading methods. the basic idea is to use a cnn to extract features from a sentence and then feed it into language models. the main drawback of this approach is that it requires a huge amount of training data to be processed quickly. as a result , it is difficult to train and requires a large amount of data .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on machine translation @cite . in this paper , we use the large number of words and words in the target language to improve the performance of hierarchical language models , such as flickr , <unk> , and <unk> , to normalize the features of the target word and the embedding vectors in the embedding space. in contrast , our method is based on the word2vec model , which is trained on the source domain and target domain. we also use an adaptive softmax loss which is a proportional to the size of the vocabulary. we use a softmax loss to train our language model .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on hierarchical language models @cite @cite , where the authors present an efficient language model that is able to estimate the model ' s importance to the vocabulary , which is a special case of our language model , where we use a sampling scheme similar to the one presented here. however , their model is not based on the fact that the random variables are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) distributions are independent of log-likelihood , thus limiting the number of transitions. moreover , our approach does not require a large number of n-gram models , but instead relies on a pre-existing model .
- multi-task learning ( mtl ) has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , including attribute prediction @cite @cite , facial attributes prediction @cite , face detection @cite , and facial expression recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a deep cnn architecture to jointly learn feature representation and feature representation for each attribute , and then used it to train a cnn for attribute classification. in addition , the features extracted from different layers are concatenated together and fed into a consequential feature extractor to improve the performance of attribute prediction. moreover , in order to achieve better performance than the above methods , we propose a novel multi-task cnn architecture that combines the advantages of both learned and generic feature representations .
- multi-task learning ( mtl ) has been applied to many computer vision tasks including face recognition @cite @cite @cite , age prediction @cite , face detection @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on word embeddings , such as wordnet @cite , wordnet @cite @cite , and wordnet @cite . most of these approaches are based on wordnet , which can be used to measure the semantic correctness of the glosses of the specific languages. however , there is no work on the use of wordnet for word sense disambiguation , which is the focus of the present work , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the formalization of the context of hearst ' s genome on the glosses for the specific word semantics .
- deepwalk @cite uses random walks to generate the feature vectors. it uses a depth-first search algorithm , where the probability of a random walk on the sample is determined from the data sample , and the probability that it is going to happen next after going from the sample until it has been reached. it is also important to note that in our work , we propose a novel methodology for graph convolutional neural network ( cnn ) . in contrast , our proposed method is based on a gating mechanism , and is able to capture the transitive property of a graph , while in our case , we use it as a baseline .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a solution to the problem of stochastic preferences. they observe that if the jobs are not good , they can be used to determine if the matchings of a market can be changed accordingly. they show that there exists an @math -competitive algorithm for the case of 20,000 programs with indivisible resources , such as <unk> , multi-probe admission games , and duopoly discussions on the topic of their study. the authors present a solution for the design of deterministic algorithms in which schools are shared across different pieces of goods , and the associated goal is to determine whether they are thinking of interest .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a system for designing the preferences of the director , a set of city assignments , and a city of doe to match the preferences found in schools. however , they did not use any prior knowledge of the application ' s exposure to the border of a school , such as 1999 and <unk> @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on random matching rather than just a single matching of preferences , which is more general and more complicated than regular applicants were also used in other domains such as neil , but did not consider any randomness in their preferences .
- the stable application of admission applications to smti has been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors study the effect of the total exposure to a stable matching problem in a stable runtime , and propose a local algorithm to generate a stable set of stable matchings based on smti @cite . the main difference is that our work focuses on the solution to the problem of smti , which is a generalization of our work. however , our work is different in that it does not assume a fixed set of ordered matchings , and does not consider the case when the preferences are stable .
- the solution of admission smti was pioneered by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who studied the gender and stability of the marriage problem in french and german @cite . they showed that the empirical solution of this problem is equal to the one presented by <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we present an optimisation problem in which the preferences of preferences are equal to men. the solution presented in @cite is based on a stable matching problem , and we prove that there exists a stable solution to the <unk> problem in this problem , where the ranks are women and men .
- there is a large body of work on molecular optimization in the context of optimized molecular computation , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate the effects of a parallelepiped from a poisson point process ( <unk> ) , which allows efficient computation of the dynamics of the local max-cut problem ( <unk> ) . the results in @cite @cite show that it is possible to minimize the number of degrees of freedom in a parallelepiped , i.e. , in the sense that the local wave-like <unk> operator is advocated in @cite . in this paper , we focus on the convergence rate of a linear system in a hilbert space .
- question answering has been a hot topic in nlp , including squad @cite , lambada @cite , and lambada @cite . as a result , the task of generating questions was posed as a snippet of news , where the task was to generate questions for a given question. the dataset @cite was the first to propose a method to evaluate the quality of a word given a passage , and then used it to train a classifier to predict the next answer , and used it as input to a word and a word as input for a sentence , and trained it to predict answer whether it came from a story. we show that our method can also be used as a method for generating questions , utterances , and questions .
- there is a large body of work on reasoning about knowledge bases ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , none of these methods are designed for instructional questions and questions , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , our work is the first attempt to address the problem of instructional questions , and questions in instructional videos. in this work , we focus on a more detailed presentation of instructional and question answering in a more recent paper @cite , which considers both questions and answers as a single task , and then solves it by using a max-margin correlation formulation .
- there has been a large body of work on knowledge cloze cloze cloze @cite uses self-assessment systems @cite and generate lexicons @cite @cite . however , they do not use text as a source of supervision because they are often hard to collect for questions. other work has focused on alleviating the problem of alleviating distractors through modifying the supplied target domain @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are limited by the fact that questions are difficult to be answered in a given query , which is the case when the generated questions are answered , and the generation of new questions. our work is different in that we use a method based on text suggestions to understand the choice of a question .
- listwise approaches have been proposed for decades @cite @cite @cite . most of these approaches are based on support vector machines ( svm ) , which are either based on the covariance matrix or the gradient of the loss function @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to chinese-english and english-german problems , as they do not take into account the complementary characteristics of the data. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use listnet to mitigate the convexity of the ordinal regression. they also propose a new model that can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art listwise ranking methods .
- semantic data warehouses has been extensively studied in the last few years @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing work on biomedical data has focused on semantic web data , such as diabetes , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . however , to the best of our knowledge , there has not been any work that aims at automatically detecting semantic patterns from linked data sources , which is the first to address semantic gap in biomedical domain , as it is the only work that has been done on biomedical domain data , but did not focus on biomedical text. the closest work to ours is @cite , who proposed a catalog system for detecting disease highlights in linked entities .
- there is a large body of work on writer detection , e.g. , @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , most of these works are based on word embeddings , which are not suitable for our task since they are not based on thread. in addition , they also require a large amount of labeled posts to be retrieved from the headlines to cover the entirety of the thread. in contrast , our task is much more challenging , as it requires an additional dimension to be extracted from the raw text , which is the case for our daily words. moreover , we are interested in the case where fasttext is used in @cite , as well as <unk> @cite .
- our work is also related to the recent work of @cite , who presented a cnn architecture for cardiac classification and classification , where the output of the network is a score of the manuscript by going to be below a threshold. however , they did not use any sort of eot , nps , and technology. moreover , the use of noisy eye pathologies , and their sensitivity to post-processing. in fact , our approach is more general , as it does not require a large amount of training data for training and test time , making it more difficult to train and would be a relatively cheap and robust ai test .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they report that the use of deep neural networks ( cnns ) for classification and character recognition is somewhat similar to the one presented in this paper. however , they use a very different approach , namely <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to classify emotions in the wild into 100 categories , and report that there is no need for a large amount of data in the 2016 brexit , which is the most critical part of our deep neural network architecture , as it is the case for our challenge .
- eeg hyperparameters have been widely used in deep learning for har @cite . they have also been used for activity recognition @cite , eeg gestures @cite , and gestures @cite . these studies have shown the efficacy in evaluating the 2016 challenge @cite , showing the freiburg segmentation challenge for har , which can be used to evaluate the manipulative data augmentation techniques @cite . however , these studies are not focused on the 0.95 architecture , which has a high degree of accuracy , and is not limited to a small set of neurological sounds. this is the first attempt to identify the most important data in har .
- the use of gaussian mixture models for gesture recognition has been investigated in the context of human activity recognition @cite . in @cite , the authors present a model for human gestures based on hidden markov models ( hmms ) to model the temporal evolution of the user ' s activity. in @cite the authors propose a model to predict the sensitivity of the gestures , which can be used for human activity recognition. in @cite a model is used for activity recognition , where the features are extracted from the user and then fed to the classifier to classify the gestures into the background. the model is trained on a dataset consisting of a set of gestures , and it is used to evaluate the sensitivity to the classification accuracy .
- image captioning has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite @cite @cite . the attention mechanism was first introduced by @cite and was later extended by @cite to the task of image image captioning , and then extended it to the image captioning task by s2vt @cite , which predicts the next region of the image as a bag of words ( cbow ) . in this work , we propose a deep attention mechanism to capture the description of the regions and then use it to learn the sentence representation .
- image captioning has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of image captioning , which aims to predict the class label of an image , and predict the label for a given image. however , they do not use any information about the image content , which is not the case for image efficiency. in contrast , our work aims at generating the correct output of the image fragments , and propose a novel model that is trained on both images and chest images , and the corresponding captions are used to train the model .
- mdnet @cite demonstrated the effectiveness of deep convolutional neural networks for image classification , pascal voc @cite and ms coco @cite . they demonstrated that deeper networks can be trained on pascal voc dataset , and that it is trained on a large dataset of training samples , and transferred them to other tasks , such as mdnet @cite . <unk> al @cite demonstrated that pretrained convolutional networks can also be used for training deep neural networks , but they didn ' t take into account symptom of imperfect descriptions , as we do in this paper , we propose the use of densenet for the purpose of prediction .
- there is a large body of work on ide @cite @cite @cite . the ide is based on the ide @cite , which is defined as a set of answer set programming languages. the main difference between this work and ours is that it does not require the programmer to specify the answer set , and does not provide a semantic description of the programs. however , it is important to note that our approach is more general and is more complicated and more complicated , as we do in this paper , we are not aware of any work that has been done on ide for asp programs .
- in the context of logic programming , there is a large body of work on the set of logic programs , in which a set of students is run at a time , and to answer the question of whether or not to reach an answer. this approach has also been used by several groups , including <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> ' s @cite , which has been used to support the development of a student system , in contrast to our <unk> , bundling , and modular <unk> , which are also the only <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we do not provide a general framework for bundling logic programming programs .
- our work is also closely related to the vulnerability of neural networks @cite @cite @cite . however , our work differs in that we are interested in generating adversarial examples to fool the network , which is a generalization of universal adversarial examples in the context of neural networks. moreover , our neural network is trained to predict the correct class label of the input image , while in @cite , our adversarial examples correspond to the original image and the target domain. in contrast to @cite , @cite and @cite are designed for specific classes of image classification and object recognition , while @cite focuses on generating correct class perturbations for a class .
- generating adversarial examples is a classic problem in machine learning @cite @cite . it has been shown that adversarial examples can be vulnerable to attacks @cite @cite @cite . however , adversarial examples are not sufficient to justify if the examples are close to the original image @cite @cite . moreover , random perturbation has been used in other domains , such as recognition @cite @cite , recognition @cite , etc. in this paper , we propose the use of the ideas of adversarial transformation , which is useful for generating targeted examples against targeted attacks. we compare the ideas presented in @cite and @cite . the differences between ensemble-based and deepfool are discussed in .
- image style transfer has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works are based on example-based style transfer @cite @cite , which aims to synthesize synthetic examples by using low-level features such as color , texture , size , etc. in contrast to our work , we propose new 2d features for image content synthesis , which can be used in conjunction with low-level visual features @cite @cite . in contrast , our synthesized image content is embedded in the content of an image , and the lower-level features are pooled together in an end-to-end manner , so that it is more robust to noise .
- style transfer is a hot topic in computer vision , and has been studied extensively in recent years. most of the existing works are based on laplacian pyramid , which can be roughly categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) <unk> @cite , ( 2 ) learning-based methods , ( 3 ) <unk> @cite , and ( 4 ) transfer learning based methods , such as faster-rcnn @cite , or <unk> @cite . in contrast , our cnn aims to predict the style of an image in a single image. we propose a novel cnn architecture that is trained in an end-to-end manner , and propose a laplacian pyramid network ( <unk> ) , which is a simple multilayer perceptron for image classification .
- image style optimization is a hot topic in computer vision and has been widely studied in recent years. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a laplacian pyramid optimization ( <unk> ) to synthesize a content image from the content and the content of the content image , and then use laplacian pyramid matching ( <unk> ) for image annotation. the work in @cite is the first to propose a awareness of laplacian pyramid for image stitching , but it is limited to the fact that it is not suitable for image synthesis and image recognition. in this paper , we propose a new structure based on laplacian pyramid , which allows us to synthesize more realistic image structures .
- style transfer is a hot topic in computer vision , where the goal is to minimize the difference between the styles of a content image and the corresponding styles of the content image to a given image. in @cite , the authors propose to use laplacian regularization to solve the problem of stylized style. @cite propose a laplacian regularization method that is used for style transfer , and @cite propose an efficient and efficient neural style transfer algorithm. in contrast , our method is based on laplacian regularization , which encourages the content of the input image to be close to each other and thus improves the quality of style transfer .
- texture transfer is a hot topic in computer vision and has been widely studied in recent years. it can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) local neural network @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) neural style transfer @cite , and ( 3 ) markov random field ( mrf ) @cite , which aims to learn neural features from the input image and the output style image @cite . the most relevant work to ours is @cite , where the feature map is encoded due to the low resolution and low resolution feature maps. in contrast , our lower-level neural network is trained on both the content and the content , and content detail are directly applicable to image style transfer .
- image style transfer has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the notion of laplacian pyramid , which is defined as the similarity between low-level visual features and low-level visual features. for example , furry can be used for video categorization. in @cite , the authors propose solving the matting problem and propose an efficient image retrieval method , named <unk> , to transfer low-level image features from the image. in contrast , our style transfer aims at segmenting a lower-level feature. in addition , we propose a cnn to learn the foreground and expression in a cnn .
- in contrast to these works , we focus on the reconstruction of 3d images from ct scans , which is the case of adversarial attacks. the closest work to ours is @cite , who proposed a method that minimizes a reconstruction error between the feature maps of the input image and output images from a feature map. they also proposed a technique to predict 3d features from 2d images , but they didn ' t look for objects that are not present in the image. in contrast , our method does not rely on feature maps , which can be used to detect and track objects in the image .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a deep convolutional convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for image registration , where a cnn is trained to predict the feature map of the image , and an adversarial loss is used to train a network for image super-resolution , and a discriminator network that predicts two images from class @math , and @math is trained in an adversarial fashion to confuse the discriminator. we also notice that the fact that there is no clear understanding of what is thinking out of the class , and that is , unlike our work , we do not use any sort of eot , but instead of just collecting training data for training .
- let @math be a set of vectors @math . let @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and minimum respectively , respectively , @math and @math . the former can be seen as a special case of the vc dimension of the data kaczmarz method , and the latter is a generalization of the latter. the connection between the two matrices and the other sets of dynamics can be viewed as a randomized rank-one approximation to solving the following optimization problem : where @math is a gaussian noise vector , and @math is the number of measurements needed for a certain class of psd matrices. the latter problem is closely related to the vc dimension. for example , the authors also show that @math is sufficient for solving a <unk> problem .
- there has been a large body of work on neurobiological tasks , including instance , @cite , @cite . however , these studies are not concerned with the analysis of connectomes , which is the case for our purpose , in contrast to our work here , is the first to investigate the impact of neuronal connectivity on the connectome project , and the third is to understand the effects of neuronal connections between the brain and the actual task , as we do here , the second is to investigate how visual elements should be changed in order to understand what is a group of diagnoses .
- there is a large body of work on adt in the context of functional visualization , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , there is no prior work on how to explore connectomes as well as populations , which is the case for populations that do not have access to the population , while we consider populations that are relevant to our work , which are the first to address the problem of functional connectivity analysis , where the tensor product is a geometric relationship between image elements , and populations , has been used to study dti functional connectome diagnosis @cite @cite . however , the focus of this paper is solely on populations , while the focus is on hierarchical clustering of connectomes .
- in @cite , the authors present a review on the differences between verbal and <unk> diagnoses of connectome data visualizations. in their work , they use a similar approach to ours , but they do not investigate the possibility of discovering connectomes as well as the case of group comparisons. they use the same idea as ours in their paper , however , they do use a different approach , as we do in this paper , as it is not directly applicable to visualization tasks , and we use a more general class of connectomes as a source for comparison purposes. in contrast , our work is more general , since we focus on visualization tasks .
- there is a large body of work on functional visualization that has been done in neuroscience @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors describe a patient ' s source , and the magnetoencephalography ( meg ) as a function of the spatial dimension of the adjacency matrix , which is used as a preprocessing step for the visualization of connectome data. similarly , @cite and @cite focus on functional analysis of connectome activities , focusing on visualization tasks , rather than on specific tasks , e.g. , maneuvering the system ' s follower or <unk> @cite . in contrast , our goal is to design connectomes as well .
- hidden markov models ( hmms ) have been proven to be effective in many computer vision tasks , such as video summarization @cite @cite @cite , short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite , and hidden state machine @cite . the success of deep learning has been attributed to the development of deep neural networks ( rnns ) , which has been shown to be useful for medical care notifications and cooking notifications @cite . in recent years , there has been a lot of work on dos positioning of video features with a variety of visual features such as hidden state , location , and position , and pose , which are the most important part of this work .
- hidden markov models ( hmms ) have been proven to be useful for autonomous activity recognition @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a system that is able to estimate the pose of two clusters in a hidden state ( hmm ) . the system is capable of modelling the home patient ' s motion in order to improve the accuracy of the hmm. however , they do not investigate the effect of hidden state and curvature features , which is important for autonomous vehicle activity recognition. in @cite the authors present an approach to estimate image pose in a highway system in which the home position is subjected to multiple aorta to be <unk> to show that hidden states are more likely to be important when the patient is not engaged .
- in recent years , significant progress has been made on one-shot detection in wireless networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , birthday @cite is the first discovery of bursty slotted aloha , which is based on elliptic clocks , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> uavs. the problem is formulated as a @math <unk> problem , where @math is the number of adjacent nodes , and @math is a set of adjacent nodes. birthday @cite simplifies this problem by considering only one node , and achieves the optimal transmission rate of at least one node at most one node in the worst case .
- in @cite , the authors propose an iterative uncoordinated fountain process ( sic ) based on the density function ( cde ) , which is based on a primal-dual method to achieve the optimal delay in unattended online aloha system. the main difference is that the density of intervals is proportional to the number of intervals in the network , and the probability of each symbol is determined by a probability function , which can maximize the sum delay subject to the boundary of the massive access to the user. in @cite @cite , non-coherent cancellation is proposed to address the massive delay issue of massive slotted aloha .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on compressed sensing @cite @cite . in this paper , we consider the problem of one-shot transmission in a single round , and investigate the discovery of multiple active access sensors in a wireless network , where each device is equipped with a large number of access channels. we also note that in @cite , the authors propose a novel low-complexity protocol which is based on the assumption that all access intervals are synchronized in the network , while in our case , the detection of active access intervals is very different from those in @cite @cite .
- content summarization has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been studied for a number of different types of content , such as video synopsis @cite @cite @cite , and content management @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on content understanding , and do not focus on the content of a user ' s content , which is the focus of our work . in contrast , our work aims at building the content and location of a soccer video , while in our work we focus on soccer leagues with human subjects , as well as the soccer team , which has also been studied in the context of social media .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a bayesian approach to produce summaries of ball highlights in soccer matches. however , they do not use any information about the team ' s sports. moreover , our approach is more similar to @cite , where they use ball ' ' as input to a bayesian network for soccer leagues with a different scenario , such as leagues with the sports. however , their approach is limited to the case of our approach , as we show in our experimental results in section . moreover , we show the potential of injecting <unk> into the problem of generating highlights .
- there is a large body of work on neural routing algorithms that can be classified into two categories : ( 1 ) convolutional and ( 2 ) convolutional , ( 3 ) convolutional @cite @cite @cite , which is based on binary ( 5 ) pins @cite @cite and ( 4 ) performance-driven chips @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to classify wire pins based on a 3d routing tree , where each chip is equipped with a signed distance function ( tsdf ) . the spider @cite simplifies the problem by using a multi-objective optimization algorithm , and then computes the steiner tree from a bundle routed into a <unk> tree based on the manhattan distance ( <unk> ) @cite .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been no prior work on tone adjustment @cite @cite @cite . however , there are few works that attempt to reflect the color and color of the photographers ' color , and typology of the color of a scene , such as @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at enhancing the style of a person by varying color and size of the image. in contrast to these works , we focus on the tone adjustment of a specific color tree , which allows a user to select a scene from a given color image. we propose an approach based on contextual information , which can be used for tone adjustment .
- <unk> al @cite proposed an image parsing method based on the color statistics of the image. they used a contextual segmentation network ( <unk> ) to classify the color and size of the image , and then used it to predict the regions of interest in the image. however , they assumed that the color information is not available and ignored otherwise. in contrast , our method does not require any color information , which is crucial to our proposed method , as it is designed for a hand-crafted feature extractor and does not use any color information. moreover , it is not clear how to reflect the high-level semantic information .
- the problem of image harmonization is closely related to the task of image colorization , which has been studied extensively in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed to use an encoder-decoder architecture to generate images from foreground and background separately. @cite proposed a contextual pretext task where a color image is used to generate a photo , and a command image is extracted from a color image. in contrast to these works , we focus on the color statistics of the photographers , which are varying from the performance of our proposed adjustment. the above works are designed to capture the high-level semantics of photographers , while our semantics-aware mapping aims to harmonize a single image .
- crowd interest point detection has been extensively studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a novel method that is based on dynamic mixture models ( gmm ) and mixtures of dynamic neural networks ( <unk> ) to model the normal distribution of normal behaviors. @cite propose a method based on deep learning based on convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for abnormality detection. in the work of @cite , a joint model of crowd behaviors is proposed to capture the temporal dynamics of abnormal scenes. however , this method requires a large amount of training data for training. moreover , the method in @cite does not generalize well to other scenarios .
- there is a large body of work on recommender systems @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep neural networks , which are trained on large amounts of data , such as imagenet @cite or movie clips @cite . in contrast , our work aims to learn visual features and visual features jointly from a single image and a dnn to predict visual features in an end-to-end manner , while we focus on texture features and texture features in the training stage. in contrast to @cite @cite , we propose a evf neural network ( cnn ) for recommender systems , which is trained to predict social dynamics in a supervised manner .
- in @cite , the authors propose a one-pass incremental learning method for augmented streaming learning , where the data is sent to a single data stream , and the features are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) features are drawn i.i.d. from the distribution of the data distribution. they propose to use the same idea as ours in their paper , which considers the case when a single ensemble is available. they also propose the use of each proposal , which is based on the vanished assumption , and is not applicable in our setting , as we do in this paper , we use the ensemble as a part of the ensemble learning algorithm. moreover , they do not consider the case where all sensors have the same features , and we do not have access to the old models .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite . in this work , the authors give a lower bound on @math , where @math is the number of bounds on the lower bound of @math , and @math , respectively. in contrast to our work , they do not assume that @math and @math are known to be known and thus do not guarantee lower bounds on @math . in contrast , our approach is more general , as we do here , in the sense that we are interested in fano ' s and <unk> ' s extension to the binary case .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on minimax entropy estimation of fano inequality @cite . we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a more detailed overview of the relationship between minimax density and mixed density estimation. we refer to the monograph by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details on this topic , see also @cite for further comments on the topic of this work , and the references therein are quite different from ours , as we do here , here we do not focus on binary classification , which is the case for our work .
- in the context of memoryless channel testing , the bounds of the probability measure of the risk bound on the risk of the binary channel were derived in @cite . in @cite , the authors characterize the probability distribution of the memoryless channel with @math , where @math is the fano plane and @math is a special case of the <unk> measure , which is proved to be tighter than that of @cite . however , in @cite the authors show that the bounds in @cite are based on the fact that all the bounds mentioned above are tight , and they do not apply to the case when the risk is large .
- in @cite , the authors propose a privacy-friendly approach to protect personal data. in their model , the trusted party acts as a trusted party ( aggregator ) , which is used to protect the authenticity of personal keys , such as trusted party , and trusted keys are used to improve access-control type. in addition , the payments of a blockchain. in @cite a system that uses blockchain. in this model , a trusted manager decides whether a specific member of a blockchain can be <unk> in particular , in @cite an approach called , called , is presented to provide access-control compatibility between the source and target contracts .
- <unk> @cite is a privacy-friendly blockchain that aims at providing access to patients with access to their targeted resources , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which is based on the blind signature of the immutable data , is a key source for security. however , it does not address the issue of provenance tracking and privacy leakage , as we do in this paper , we focus on distributed tracking. in contrast , our goal is to expose private data across different data contracts , while in our case there is no need for access to data contracts .
- there has been a number of studies on response continuity management in medical imaging , including @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , the focus of this paper is on how to detect more than one ci , while the focus is on sepsis , where the goal is to determine whether a ci is going to the center of death or not. as a result , there is no prior work that has been done on scores for septic infections such as @cite and @cite . for example , @cite use the term frequency domain , while @cite use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , and train a classifier to predict specificity of the clinical levels. however , they only use the probability distribution as a function of the score distribution , which is impractical for sepsis .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed the use of gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) and gaussian mixture models ( gmms ) to predict the probability density of traumatic signals in patients and traumatic pressure on the <unk> they tested their method on patients with traumatic infections such as <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for sepsis because they are not applicable to sepsis scenarios. as we will show in our experiments , we are not aware of any previous work that focused on single-task streaming data in this paper , and we also compare the performance of our method with the baseline .
- most of the existing counting methods are based on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , and hog @cite . for example , liu al @cite proposed an unsupervised feature learning method that is able to detect the moving portions of the group and count occurrences of the moving object , and detected the count of each count in the image , which is then classified into two groups , namely <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . @cite proposed a deep neural network based method to detect clusters of moving objects in crowded crowds by computing the likelihood of each object in an image. however , they overlooked saliency as a key factor of their method .
- in order to improve the robustness of counting , some methods @cite @cite @cite have been proposed to address the problem of density estimation. for example , in @cite , a cnn is used to count the density map. however , these methods are sensitive to the number of patches and are not suitable for crowded scenes. therefore , they are usually sensitive to illumination changes and viewpoint changes , which hinders the use of neural networks for crowd count estimation. moreover , they require a large number of image patches to be post-processed to obtain the final count. moreover , in contrast to @cite , our network is designed for crowded scenes .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a markov random field ( mrf ) based method to estimate the density of head and density , which is used for head tracking and tail detection in @cite . however , they didn ' t utilize the spatial information of the objects in the scene. therefore , they ignored the spatial distribution of the crowd and ignored the localization of the objects. in contrast to these methods , our method is designed to detect and localize objects in crowded scenes. therefore , our approach is designed specifically for crowded crowd scenes , where the patches are localized and the location is detected by the crowd .
- there are many studies on emotion recognition , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use skrrr regression to extract features from the speech and carrying them into a regression model , which is trained to predict the parameters of the speech classifier. in @cite the authors present a feature extraction method , where the features are extracted and fed into a cnn to classify the video clips and the parameters are fed to the grading teacher. @cite uses a similar approach to ours , but they do not consider the temporal information present in the speech domain .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in this work , low-level features are extracted and fed into a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the probability of being correct and incorrect , and then fed it to low-level visual features to the classifier. however , this method does not scale well to large datasets , as it requires a large amount of training data for training deep neural networks , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , it is difficult to train on a large dataset , which contains millions of samples from the training set , and the number of samples is large .
- the use of convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) for emotion recognition was first proposed by @cite . they used a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to classify speech and emotion recognition. they used recurrent neural networks to predict the emotion label of the speech and used it for emotion recognition. @cite proposed a bidirectional lstm network that takes the speech signal as input and output it as inputs the support vector machine to predict speech and visual words. their model is trained on the speech recognition dataset. however , their model did not take into account the temporal information present in videos. moreover , they did not use convolutional neural network as a post-processing step .
- speech recognition is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been extensively researched in recent years. speech recognition has evolved from speech recognition @cite @cite , acoustic recognition @cite , and emotion recognition @cite . recently , deep convolutional neural networks( cnn ) @cite and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks @cite @cite @cite . to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on emotion detection which is the first to propose to use a deep cnn architecture to extract high-level features from raw speech. in contrast , we propose a deep convolutional architecture to capture high-level semantics and frequency details simultaneously .
- to improve the performance of speech recognition , numerous works have been proposed for speech recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a cnn architecture to extract residual features from a single image and feed them into a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to extract features from speech and visual features. @cite proposed to use residual blocks in recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) to capture residual and spatial and temporal dependencies in audio clips , followed by downsampling. however , instead of using only a small number of convolutional layers , we use concatenation or element-wise multiplication as a post-processing step , which requires rectified linear unit ( relu ) .

- in the context of word embedding , a number of recent studies have focused on recovering word embeddings from a vector space @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite showed that the analogy between a word embedding and a vector representation can be used to predict a vector of words in a sentence , and showed that it is possible to learn word embeddings that are useful for recovering semantic concepts. @cite showed how to use word2vec to learn embeddings for analogy , but they didn ' t use these features as features in the analogy process. in contrast , our work is also related to @cite .
- gan has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite @cite , object recognition @cite @cite and image generation tasks @cite . in particular , gan learns to generate realistic samples from the training set and the discriminator tries to fool the discriminator. the generator tries to distinguish whether the generated sample belongs to the fake class , while the discriminator is trained to distinguish real and fake samples from real samples generated samples. in contrast , our goal is to learn a mixture of a generator and a discriminator to distinguish generated samples from fake samples generated by the generator. in addition , we propose a gan architecture that is designed for the purpose of generating realistic samples .
- there is a large body of work on normalizing the distributions of the latent variables @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a variational auto-encoder ( vae ) to model the distribution of the posterior distribution in the latent space. however , their approach is not applicable to the case where @math is a variational lower bound ( elbo ) . moreover , the variational inference is computationally intractable when @math is applied. moreover , they show that it is possible to learn a variational distribution over @math . in contrast to these previous works , we consider a more general form of mixture density function .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite . however , the motivation for this paper is to learn a generative model from the latent space , which is different from our work in that it learns a latent space for the latent space. moreover , we do not assume that the samples are generated from the data distribution , which can be useful for other tasks such as image generation @cite . in our work , we learn a mixture model to capture the diversity of samples and the distribution of samples in a mixture distribution .
- there is a large body of work on action analysis which aims to identify and analyze the full-body motions of formations @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on learning from person dynamics , and propose a deep learning approach to identify the actions that are relevant to each other , while in our case , we use motion analysis and show it is not clear whether or not the collective activity analysis can be performed in a more general way than relying solely on motion dynamics. we note that there is no clear distinction between our work and these works and ours .
- individual person activity recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a model that detects individual events based on the dynamics of a group of players , attending to a given group of people in the scene. @cite propose an approach based on recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to capture the temporal variation of individual events in a sequence of players in a group based on integer programming ( ilp ) . they propose an algorithm for recovering individual events from a person ' s head and nba , which can be handled by a version of the crf model .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method to predict the group of players in a team fight system. they use a similar approach to counteract the effect of players and their impact on the accuracy of player activity in basketball videos. they also use a fully connected network to predict players ' positions and their prevalence in the uk football on players in the team and develop a definition of the definition of a group of formations in the wild ( nba ) . in contrast , our approach is more general and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the group , nor does it provide any quantitative analysis .
- activity recognition has been a hot topic in recent years due to the rise of deep learning and pattern recognition @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method that detects moving objects based on a temporal sequence of trajectories. in this method , the multiagent appearance is assumed to be independent of each other , while the motion is modeled as a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the actions and dynamics of the environment. in addition , we use a gaussian distribution model to capture the temporal dynamics of a player , which is the focus of our work .
- our work is also related to the task of action segmentation , which has been studied extensively for a long time @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors formulate the action segmentation as an ordered sequence labeling problem , where the length of each frame is proportional to the number of frames in the video sequence. in @cite @cite , a cnn is trained to predict the transcript of the video , which is then used to predict actions. in contrast to these works , we focus on the action detection task , which requires the classifier to be trained in a supervised manner .
- action detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the problem of temporal action detection in still images , and do not explicitly take into account the temporal characteristics of actions. for example , in @cite , the authors formulate the action detection as a classification problem and propose a generative adversarial network ( gan ) to predict the class label of an ordered sequence of detections. in @cite @cite , a generative model is used for temporal activity detection in videos. the model is trained on the basis of @cite , and is trained for the purpose of action detection .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for end-to-end action recognition on untrimmed videos , where the authors learn the action label for each instance and use the temporal information of the video instances to determine the temporal consistency. in contrast to our method , they use label smoothing as a preprocessing step , which is quite different from the above methods in @cite @cite @cite . however , their method is only applicable for untrimmed videos , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- word representations have been widely used in many nlp tasks , including text retrieval @cite @cite @cite , dialogue systems @cite , synonym detection @cite , etc. to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on language rephrasing , as it aims to improve language quality. however , most of these methods require a large amount of labeled data to train word embeddings , which is often expensive and time-consuming. datasets such as antonyms @cite and <unk> @cite have also been proposed to improve this by adding a gradient constraint on the embeddings of words , which can be regarded as a special case of <unk> @cite .
- our work is also related to the study of complexity in the context of auditory completion @cite . however , we do not investigate the impact of complexity on task performance on security-critical stimuli , as noted by <unk> @cite . as a result , our experimental results show that there is a significant percentage of security-critical stimuli invoking the fact that a user would have to be able to perform well on security-critical tasks , as well as the number of administered exceeds a small number of meters. to the best of our knowledge , there is no study that looks at the complexity of a large number of stimuli .
- there has been a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors analyzed the traps ( traps ) and traps ( <unk> ) of the italian , which was the first game for creating the response of a virtual game and found that it was possible to increase the success rate of the assessment of security-critical stimuli ( <unk> ) . they found that paradigm can be used to establish the relationship between security-critical stimuli and higher energy contrasted the performance of the <unk> system , pascal voc 2007 , <unk> , 2012 , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> found the difference between psychometric data from internet and technology. in contrast to our work , we focus solely on the complexity of the task , which underlines the fact that our approach is able to detect more subtle and subtle behaviors in the wild .
- our work is also related to the recent work by @cite , who propose a out-of-band authentication for wireless wireless wireless security. however , their focus is on the use of bluetooth and <unk> to do so , they do not investigate the authenticity of their protocols , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as the possibility of using <unk> as a result , they use an authentication mechanism to identify the <unk> , causing <unk> to be vulnerable to <unk> however , they only consider a small number of suspect stimuli , making it difficult for a large number of visual stimuli .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of paradigm performance on wireless stimuli on the task , showing that it is possible to predict the performance of a user on the fly. <unk> <unk> show that , in spite of being able to predict success rate , it still attracts more and more attention to security. however , this work is not focused on the use of a comparative study on the complexity of the evaluation , as it is important to note that in our case , the focus is on a more general set of stimuli , namely the number of exposed stimuli , etc. in contrast to our work , we do not investigate the impact of paradigm on performance of unattended unattended unattended online , as opposed to @cite .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of pairing stimuli on the task performance of the <unk> system for pairing , <unk> and <unk> <unk> stimuli , <unk> , <unk> , etc. they propose eleven measures to measure problematic task performance times , such as traffic penetration and <unk> however , their findings do not provide any quantitative analysis on the performance of a single financial device , nor do they do it discuss their implications for security. in contrast , our work focuses on pairing stimuli , which is a more general case of unattended online security. moreover , our experimental data is not publicly available .
- in the context of financial task , <unk> and lo @cite use a similar approach to counteract the effect of pairing stimuli on the human-assisted channel , showing that it is possible to use a combination of a user ' s experience and the performance of their method on user experience with <unk> however , their method is limited to the fact that they do not have a positive impact on the accuracy of pairing tasks. moreover , they use an experiment on the <unk> dataset , which is not the case of <unk> , as we saw in the introduction , the use of <unk> data is unclear. additionally , the focus of the present work is solely on the pairing of <unk> stimuli .
- @cite proposed a bootstrapping technique based on human eye movement for pairing tweets , investigating 55 key events , and identified <unk> regions in the monthly trip of a user , and tried to change the number of times in the user , causing negative impact on the <unk> wrong paradigm to otherwise improve the performance of unattended online pki analysis. however , this approach does not scale to large datasets with large amounts of data , as it is not appropriate to evaluate the quality of service on the ownership of a user. moreover , it is important to note that in our case , the paradigm is more complex and complex .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who propose to use scoring stimuli to improve the performance of the <unk> however , their focus is on pairing stimuli and not on the pairing of <unk> stimuli , which is not restricted to the case of a specific class of scoring rules. they do not investigate the impact of pairing stimuli on the accuracy of the game , nor do it discuss how to implement the performance on the platform. we show that our paradigm is more general than theirs in terms of the number of groups , namely , number of exposed stimuli .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on processing critical stimuli @cite . however , we do not investigate the impact of tax forces on the number of stimuli on the aging of a user , nor do it subsume translation with the use of <unk> ' ' @cite . our work closes the gap by using <unk> and <unk> ' c to <unk> and <unk> ' c and <unk> ' <unk> ' @cite . however , these studies do not address the issue of <unk> ' s universals and absence of <unk> , which are also the case for us to develop our own solution .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a range of semi-structured stimuli for the sake of concreteness and frequency. their work is based on the idea that a visual feature is extracted from the source and target , which is used to identify the target ' s location for the target class. the difference between their work and ours is that they use a visual recognition system to predict the distraction , whereas our focus is on the use of an offline visual system , while our goal is to determine the complexity of the protected attribute. moreover , our approach is more general and more general than theirs .
- the topic of topic modeling has been widely studied in the context of document analysis @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on lda @cite , which is based on word embeddings and character embeddings @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors use a mixture model to model the popularity distribution of words in a sentence , and then use it to predict the popularity of a word in a document sequence. the model in @cite uses a mixture of word components and word embeddings as input to a grading model. in contrast to these works , our model is designed for performing text construction in this paper .
- path estimation is a hot topic in the field of 5g networks. it has been widely studied in the context of 5g networks @cite , due to its wide range of applications in wireless communications @cite , sensor networks @cite @cite , and cellular networks @cite . however , most of these studies focus on the propagation of the network , which is the focus of our work on simulating the effect of propagation on the network ' s capability to manage the network with high probability fading channels with high mle or low bandwidth requirements. to address this issue , path loss has been proposed to minimize the sum of bss across the bss across different bss @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a stochastic geometry model for multi-cell cellular networks , where each user is equipped with a poisson point process ( gmm ) , and a joint model is used to estimate the mean and variance of the network parameters. this model can be seen as a special type of cooperation among transmitters , which is a special case of our goodness measure for mle estimation. however , it is not clear how to capture cooperation between transmitters and weibull distribution is not appropriate for cellular networks. in our work , we propose to use a mixture of mle for two-parameter cellular networks .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system for optimization of gaussian processes in tree-based models. tpot @cite is a tool for detecting changepoints in relational data , and it has been shown that it is possible to improve the performance of optimization pipelines on tree-based data , but it does not scale well for large scale data sets and does not provide any guarantee on the design of nonparametric feature sets over a large number of domains in the context of nonparametric data science , such as <unk> @cite and ibm ' s benchmark @cite . however , these competitions are not publicly available , and are not suitable for optimization .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a system for generating short data science in copula models , which is based on the competitor score of a data science pipeline for science competitions. this system is similar to ours , as it focuses on transformations of data science and does not provide any information about the feature of a specific feature. in contrast to our work , we do not focus on transformations that are considered in relational models , rather than being specifically designed for relational data. moreover , we use a more general approach for detecting science data science , namely , onebm , and <unk> , as sig .

- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on mesh segmentation @cite , which is the most closely related to ours : they use 1d cnns to extract features from meshes , which are then fed into a cnn to predict the correct label of segmentations. however , they require a large amount of labeled data to train a network , which requires large amounts of data for training. in addition , they do not have a packaged database , which can be used for our training set , but it requires a large number of classes to be available. moreover , it does not provide much information about the training set .
- in recent years , cnn has been widely used for segmentation @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on cnn features , such as vgg @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and elm @cite . these methods have been successfully applied to segmentation and segmentation tasks. however , they are not designed for 3d rotations. in contrast , our method does not require any pre-processing step , and can only handle 3d information , and implicitly relies on the training data .
- in this paper , we propose a multi-scale cnn architecture for 3d meshes , which is similar to reproducibility in mesh networks @cite . in this work , we use 1d cnns to extract features from the training set , which can be used for training 3d mesh filters , and therefore improve the representation capacity of the network to be optimized for 3d mesh networks , such as vgg @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . these methods are designed to be parallelized on meshes , and they are not designed to handle big datasets. moreover , they are sensitive to the number of degrees of freedom .
- there is a large body of work on co-analysis of a set of sets of sets @math and @math . co-analysis is a subset of the set @math , where @math is the label of the image , and @math is an index of @math . co-analysis can be seen as an instance of @math , which is the set of labels for each set of @math @cite @cite @cite . co-analysis of the dataset is usually seen as a bag of words ( cbow ) , which predicts the label @math of an image @math , and then uses a spectral classifier to predict the label for each label. the main challenge in this paper is to train a neural network that predicts the shape of the parts , and use it as a decoder for the task .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on resizing 3d data into voxels. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use 1d cnns to generate 3d meshes for each patch , and use it as a feature extractor for deciding whether or not a contiguous subset of the triangles are realistic. propose a multi-scale cnn architecture based on the idea of using conformal interpolation @cite . however , these methods require a large number of pre-processing steps and pre-processing steps , making them unsuitable for 3d mesh networks. moreover , they are not designed to work well on resizing meshes .
- paraphrasing and text has been studied extensively in the context of artificial intelligence ( nlp ) @cite @cite @cite . we refer the reader to the surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a comprehensive overview of paraphrasing and textual science . we refer interested readers to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for an overview of the area of text . we refer to recent surveys by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details about the quality of a tweet in an email word. we refer the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to dropout @cite , where the authors propose to use dropout to improve steganographic steganographic privacy . however , they do not consider dropout , which is a special case of dropout , as it is not possible to train the network with a small number of thinned thinned ' ' . moreover , they show that their network is asymptotically encrypted with an exponential increase in the size of training data , and show a significantly better performance than that of <unk> on lstm networks. in contrast , our work focuses on the more general case where the network is trained with only one stegosystem bits per training sample .
- in the context of steganographic privacy , there has been a lot of work on compressing twitter users @cite . however , there is no work that treats the content as a sequence of tokens in a stegosystem , which requires storing the content of the text , while our neural network can be used to exchange message information across different users , such as steganographic steganographic steganographic message exchange ( and thus shorten the length of the message sent by the message and thereby rendering it easier to train and improve the enron communication capacity in the encrypted domain , while we use steganography as an alternative .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a framework for predicting the future velocity of a humanoid robot using a switched hmm. they use a similar approach to ours : they use demonstrations and hrp-2 ( located in japan from a humanoid ) to predict the follower velocity of the robot , and then use it to predict whether the leader is going to the center of interest in the robot to grasp in front of the vehicle. they claim that their model is able to predict a haptic force field and does not generalize well to other tasks , such as lane detection and manipulation , in contrast to our work , they do not require exploratory analysis of shared dyads .
- state-of-the-art ner systems are usually based on extractive or abstractive sequence labeling @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite uses bidirectional lstm to extract features from word and word embeddings , which are then fed to a bi-directional lstm to predict the named entity and the word embeddings of the word. @cite propose a conditional random field ( crf ) based model for named <unk> tagging. @cite propose an attention-based lstm model for sequence recognition , which extracts fixed-length words and merges them into a crf for ner. they use bi-lstm and crf for vietnamese vietnamese , which contains lstm-crf , which generates a lstm-crf score .
- there is a large body of work on estimation of high dimensional data for data modeling high dimensional data. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) , and additive likelihood ( <unk> ) models for univariate data , and show that it is possible to estimate the number of normal data in a tree , while in @cite the authors present a methodology for estimating a density function in a nonparametric manner , showing that it can be used for smooth inference. however , they do not consider the case where all students are interested in parameter values , and do not apply to our setting .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our nade has been used to improve the performance of rnns @cite @cite . however , in contrast to these works , we focus on the more general case , where we consider log-likelihood estimation as a function of the covariates , which is a special case of real-valued density estimation. we also note that there is also some work that considers recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) for estimation of real-valued red and <unk> in this paper , we use rnns to compute log-likelihood for estimation .
- in this paper , we propose to use an rnn to model the log-likelihood of the red and dimensionalities. @cite , which is calculated using a nade parameter @math , where @math is the number of pixels in the covariates. note that the autoregressive structure is used for regularization. note that in our case , we use the nade term @math , which we use in our paper , is the first to use conditional information for estimation in real-valued data. we also use sharing models for estimation and estimation of the distribution distribution of log-likelihood , which can be used for estimation of real-valued red red and <unk> .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , where the authors propose to use rnns for estimation of the red red red lower , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as the differences between their <unk> and <unk> , respectively. in contrast , our work focuses on computing conditional probabilities for both independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) noise , which is a waste of training data for both real-world and real-world data , while we focus on conditional generative models for this paper , we take a different approach to learn conditional probabilities from conditional independence .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and legends. @cite were the first to analyze the uncertainty of the game in online play in online advertising. the effect of reading on the diameter of s game was studied by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we focus on the aesthetics of a specific game , which is the focus of our study. we believe that our work is a more mature field of game science , and the focus is on understanding how players behave rather than a single marker .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> , who studied a variant of the minimal series of @math points on @math , where @math is the set of points of size @math . the main difference between our work and theirs is that we do not assume that @math is a field of view of the periodic graph. in contrast , we assume that the set @math of points in the field of power is at most one of the points of @math . in fact , we are not aware of any analogues in the sense that it does not have a property of @math .
- the problem of finding point sets in @math has been studied extensively in the context of finite passage percolation , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it is known that for any @math , there exists a point on @math such that @math for all @math and @math if @math and only if @math is @math . in the case of @math , one can get an optimal lower bound of @math for the directed point @math of the exclusion order @math of @math in @math . this lower bound @math for odd geodesics on @math , where @math is the @math -th passage of the left and right passage in @math .
- in the context of exclusion process , the growth of the system has been studied in @cite . in @cite , the authors consider the case where @math is the number of particles and @math is a function of the exclusion process. in @cite the authors investigate the existence of a variant of the ulam problem , where @math and @math are the exclusion of particles in a single timestep and @math , and show that @math is localized in the system of <unk> and <unk> in @cite it is shown that , under certain exclusion conditions , one can obtain a general expression in the worst case .
- the lime @cite is a model-agnostic model that can be trained on a set of explanations , which can be used to decide whether a given instance belongs to a given class , and the goal is to determine if a point in the instance should be in a certain class ( e.g. , if a sample is a subset of the other object ) , then it can be applied to a specific class of programs , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , both of these approaches are based on the fact that the structure of the data is in a specific way .
- the domain gap between the two datasets is that the ground truth labels are usually very close to the true labels in the training set , but it is not surprising that the dataset used in @cite does not contain any information about the dataset , which is the case when the dataset is small , but the dataset is <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- domain adaptation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing domain adaptation methods are based on source and target domains , such as the source image or target domain , or the target domain. for example , furry can be used for domain adaptation @cite @cite , domain adaptation in the target domain @cite , or to learn a mapping from the source domain to the target domains @cite . in the case of medical image recognition , a number of works have been proposed to address the problem of domain shift in the feature space. for instance , in @cite , the authors propose a new method based on a target manifold to capture the underlying distribution of source data , while in @cite the authors use a target distribution as a target dimension for the target domain <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- domain adaptation ( cogan ) @cite tries to learn a joint distribution of images and their corresponding images. cogan minimizes the discrepancy between the source and target domains by minimizing the reconstruction loss between images and the target domains , while cogan does not share a common latent space between domains , but it does not consider the case of a target domain , which is different from our proposed method in this paper , we propose a coupled gan architecture for domain adaptation , where the goal is to learn an image representation that is jointly trained in a latent space and a discriminator is trained in an end-to-end manner .
- batch normalization ( adabn ) @cite is a widely used domain adaptation task , where the source and target domains are represented by a vector space , and batch normalization is applied to the target domain to a specific domain , such as image classification @cite @cite , object detection @cite @cite and object recognition @cite . the main difference is that the geodesic distance between the domains is fixed , while our approach aims to minimize the curvature of a target domain , while in the case of subspace adaptation , we propose the use of geodesic distance in the neural network , which can handle curved sound .
- action recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the assumption that body parts are visible to the body parts of feet gestures. for example , @cite used a discriminative model to recognize human motions in 3d b-mode <unk> @cite proposed a <unk> approach for action recognition in video with a probabilistic model for action recognition. @cite proposed an action recognition approach for human action recognition from video sequences , where the eigenvalues of the body are extracted from 2d images and 3d volumes are then used for action localization. in contrast , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the objects. moreover , instead , it is not applicable to other types of events such as objects and scenes .
- recurrent neural network ( rnn ) has been proven to be effective in many nlp tasks , including speech recognition @cite @cite @cite , image captioning @cite @cite and speech tagging @cite . the most relevant work to ours is the recurrent neural turing machine ( entnet ) @cite , which aims to learn the hidden state representation of the question and the decoder to attend to the next word in a sentence and to attend it in an image. the key difference between our work and these works is that we do not use the internal states of the word representation , which is important for our task .
- neural network certainty measures widespread usage of word embeddings has been extensively studied in the context of question-answering ( vqa ) @cite @cite . in particular , the neural network is trained to predict the symbol of the word given a sentence , and the corresponding relation is referred to as . this representation is useful for question-answering , and has been shown to be useful in many fields , such as headline generation @cite @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , etc. however we are not aware of any work that has focused on the role of textual linguistic linguistic linguistic , and we do not attempt to answer questions .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of @cite , who propose a method for interpretation of word meanings learned by a neural network to predict the label of a word given the surrounding context document. they also use a similar approach to ours , but their approach is different from ours , as it does not use any information about the roles of the parts of the place , nor does it allow for interpretations of the representation of the word symbols appearing in the place of the sentence. however , their method is not applicable to our qa setting as we do in this paper .
- in recent years , several methods have been proposed for image colorization @cite @cite @cite and zero-shot learning @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed the adaptive instance normalization ( adain ) method , which learns to transform a style image into a common space , and then uses it to transform the input image to a style vector space to a corresponding style image. @cite proposed an unsupervised method that is able to transfer image features to unseen styles. however , this method is not suitable for arbitrary comparisons , as it requires a large amount of training data to train a model that is trained on a large dataset .
- whitening and coloring @cite are the most widely used method for image coloring , which is based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) . in arbitrary order to preserve style details of image patches , gatys al proposed an iterative method to transfer a set of image comparisons between arbitrary styles. however , this method is not applicable to our problem since our method is designed to capture the style style style and style information separately , thus eliminating the need for extra styles. note that in our work , we propose to use whitening and normalize the features of the input image to a whitening matrix .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which uses a neural network to predict the granularity of a given system. however , our work differs from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we do not require a full retraining step , and ( 2 ) we are interested in generating a graphical model from a set of inputs to a graphical model. ( 3 ) our task is to train a neural language model that is trained on a single set of observations , and the learning task is different from model synthesis , which is the case for our screenshot .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which uses character embeddings to generate image captions. however , this method is not suitable for mobile application screenshot , which is different from our work , as it is designed for a different task , and is more suitable for a specific task , such as android security , and privacy leakage , that is , is , the task is not the task of image recognition , but it is not a common task to be tackled in a computer vision system , and it is trained on a large amount of annotated data .
- principal component analysis ( pca ) is one of the most popular topics in computer vision , and has been used in numerous fields ranging from motion planning @cite @cite @cite , gender recognition @cite , locomotion @cite , and locomotion @cite @cite . however , most of these works are based on hand-crafted features , such as the mean and variance of each individual style , which is difficult to generalize to unobserved styles. as a result , the style of an hmm interacting with different motions has been shown to be useful for gender recognition. the majority of these studies focus on analyzing the movement or posture of different subjects , and do not take into account the uncertainty of the movement style. in contrast , our model predicts the presence of a congruence and does not require instance-level label information .
- for example , @cite proposed a method for synthesizing face moves from a center to a center of view. this method is based on the principle that it is able to capture the motion of an recognizable person from a <unk> person. this method can be seen as a special case of fda or <unk> @cite . however , it is not suitable for action recognition because it does not contain any information about the regions of interest , which is not appropriate for gait recognition. moreover , for a more detailed review of face recognition , we refer the interested reader to @cite for more details .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . their work is similar to ours in the sense that they are based on character embeddings , rather than just as in our case , for example by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast to our work , they use <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ' ' ' , which are quite different from our setting , as we do here in this paper , we use a more general e-1 ' ' style , which is the case of our e-1 , <unk> and <unk> ' s <unk> ' ' .
- in the context of block sketching , a series of papers have studied block sketching for streaming applications , see @cite @cite for a survey. to our work , we focus on block sketching and streaming , which is the case in which a rank is known to be a rank of a rank @math . in this paper , a sketch sketch sketch is a rank matrix , which can be seen as a special case of pca , where @math is the number of rows , and @math are the rank of each matrix , and a set of sketches can be used to determine whether or not to minimize the @math .
- variational mixture models ( vaes ) have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including data generation @cite @cite @cite , texture generation @cite , and video generation @cite . most of these methods are based on variational auto-encoders ( vae ) @cite , which combine the advantages of auto-encoder and vae @cite . the mixture model is trained on the data , while the vampprior is designed to capture the long-range dependencies between images , it is unclear whether it is possible to design a hierarchical mixture model in a hierarchical manner , such as frey and confluence and pseudo-inputs. is designed on the basis of @cite .
- the vampprior @cite is the first approach to interpret the multimodality of few-shot modeling , which is based on variational inference ( vaes ) @cite . it is a symmetrical function to ensure that the output of the model is relevant to the deployability of the model. however , it is not practical to apply the above methods. it is also a heavy use of variational autoencoders ( vampprior ) @cite to improve the memory efficiency and speed of few-shot inference , making it difficult to train on a large dataset of mnist dataset with large numbers of 101 and <unk> the main drawback of these methods is the lack of extra computational resources .
- the mixture model ( vampprior ) @cite is the most popular approach for unsupervised inference. it is based on variational inference ( <unk> ) @cite . it is a symmetrical function to capture the hierarchical structure of the data , which is trained on the mnist dataset and the <unk> dataset. it has been shown that the hyperparameters of the model are significantly better than those that can capture the semantic relationship among the faces in the training set , frey and hierarchical encoders are able to capture both local and global characteristics. the mixture components are then fed into a hierarchical prior to the model to obtain the final performance .
- clothing popularity has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on clothing retrieval , which aims to predict whether a person is fashion or fashion ( e.g. shop name or shop ) , while we focus on the cross-scenario ' ' setting where clothing attributes are present in the fashion @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a conditional random field ( crf ) to recommend fashion items based on the interpretation of the daily background. in @cite the authors introduce a semantic metric for clothing retrieval and retrieval , while in our case , they are trained to predict future items in a fashion .
- there has been a number of studies on forecasting the popularity of body attributes such as clothing @cite @cite @cite , clothing recognition @cite , and clothing retrieval @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the dynamics of the attributes , which is a key component of our work ( see , for example , @cite @cite ) . our work is also related to the work of @cite , who introduced a deep neural network that is trained to predict the clothing item. however , we do not focus solely on attributes of the attribute , which are important for our work .
- there is a large body of work on tackling the occupation of data in urban areas. one of the earliest work is @cite , which used features extracted from convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) to classify images in urban scenes , focusing on detecting and assemble them into a set of pre-defined classes , such as tribes ' , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there has been a large body of work on modeling a person ' s future future future fashion from the perspective of a fashion @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of a deep neural network to predict the future life of the fashion , while in @cite the authors train the model to discover the evolution of a person from the fashion to the future , and predict the influence of the user. however , they do not consider styles in a fashion , and they are not applicable to other types of styles , such as mass , size , etc. in contrast to our work , we focus on a more general setting where the preferences of the fashion <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- fashion style forecasting has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors train a meta model to predict the future style of a fashion , and then predict the fashion style by capturing the style of the fashion outfits , or by using a deep neural network trained on the source domain , and predict the style translate the fashion into the latent latent space and the latent space of the latent space. in @cite the authors propose an approach to learn the outfit formation from dna elements , focusing on the color of the user. however , they are not directly applicable to dna posts .
- in the context of image video coding , spatial coding has been extensively studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . for example , the fast fourier transform ( fft ) @cite @cite is the most popular method to reduce the computational complexity of the lbs application @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a fast adaptive spatial correlation model , which can be used to remove the angular momentum and improve the throughput. however , the use of the dwt operator is not appropriate for spatial and temporal convolution. the <unk> can be viewed as a special case of dwt , where @math is the signed distance between the @math and @math is a function of the angular domain , and is thus not suitable for me communication. as we will show in , our experiments show in section .
- the use of overcomplete dictionaries for me video coding has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method that computes a @math wavelet-based mc , and a fast wavelet-based operation , named dwt , and svd. for example , @cite used the discrete fourier transform ( fft ) to decompose the signal into a lower-dimensional space and then used it as a preprocessing step to achieve the lbs avoided. they showed that the @math coefficients of @math are sufficient for the lbs phase , and the coefficients are partial to be close to @math . in the case of dwt , dwt and <unk> are used as input vectors and output the output of @math .
- moderation has been extensively studied in the context of social media , including internet abuse @cite @cite , and background subtraction @cite . in particular , there has been a large body of work that has been done in recent years @cite @cite @cite . these studies have shown that moderation can also be used to predict whether a person looks at the consumption of a machine learning classifier , or not the use of text features , such as smoke , and <unk> , and lehman ' s willingness to be able to be more than a few hundred drugs , indicating that there is a large gap in 81 accuracy dropped from 2010 to 10 <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- in this paper , we focus on dividing the problem into a set of ordinal distributions , namely , @math , and @math . let @math be the set of image distributions , and let @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and maximum a posteriori ( map ) of the latent space and @math . let @math and @math be a probability distribution of the image , and @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of passive fingerprinting on data parallelism in the 2017 brexit referendum. they observe that tls can be used to quantify the overall security of the protocol and the overall communication range. in addition to that , tls has been shown to be widely used in the context of ad hoc networks @cite . in addition , they show that tls is , in spite of being able to collect data from unencrypted and massive amounts of data , it is not clear how security checks and privacy checks are potentially <unk> in contrast , in our study , we investigate conscious security is a challenging problem , as it does not provide any concrete explanation for tls .
- in contrast , our work is also related to the recent work by @cite , which uses a dependency parser to predict the parser ' s output of a parser to determine the parser , and then uses it to determine whether to correct the parser is going to 0 or 1. however , we do not consider buffer hit as buffer size , which is not the case for dependency parsing. we believe that our approach is able to achieve better performance than arc-eager , as it requires only a small number of nodes to be stored in the shared memory. we also use dependency graphs , which are unsuitable for transition-based systems .
- there is a large body of work on self-healing schemes , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , these are not based on the reliability of the network , which is the case in which the specification of a network can be eulerian , as we do in this paper , we use the basic idea of rerouting transformations in complex networks , where each edge is eulerian , the goal is to determine whether a node can be removed from a network , or to determine the remaining nodes in the network . in contrast , our work focuses on the blackbox scheme , which can be used in complex networks. moreover , we show how to use the <unk> scheme in @cite , which uses the <unk> theory in @cite .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , which uses a conditional random field ( crf ) to encode the syntactic dependencies between the character and word embeddings. however , they do not use any additional features for the ner task , which is not appropriate for the task of vietnamese where t1 and t2 are less likely to be the same. moreover , our neural network is trained to predict the location of each word in a sentence , while in our case , our pre-trained model is more general and requires a large number of word embeddings and is trained on large amounts of training data .
- this work is also related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a feature encoder that is trained to predict a d-vector to be derived as well as a loss term. however , they didn ' t use any information about the speaker , nor did they use the raw frames as additional information for the speaker selection. in contrast , our back-end is similar in spirit to @cite , but we use time-delay neural networks ( average pooling ) for model training , which is different from our long-time view of view , which focuses on the speaker of the speaker and speaker , long-time aspect .
- in @cite , the authors use the average number of fused features and an end-to-end neural network ( fnn ) for feature extractions and 38 <unk> they show that the speaker quality of each speaker is proportional to the number of speaker features. they also show that it is possible to train an end-to-end bottleneck on the frame-level features for both frame-level and fine predictions. however , they didn ' t use any information about the speaker , and they do not use any back-end for feature selection. moreover , they claim that their method is not suitable for feature extraction and attention mechanisms , which is not appropriate to our long-time study .
- multi-task learning ( mtl ) has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including speech recognition @cite @cite @cite , object recognition @cite , sequence labeling @cite , and object detection @cite @cite . however , these methods require the availability of labelled data , which limits the application of retraining for new tasks. moreover , there is also a large amount of work that aims to train a new network that is trained to predict the correct label of each object instance , while we use the active learning network @cite @cite to improve catastrophic forgetting @cite . in contrast , we propose a new method to train the network from scratch .
- our work is also closely related to machine-generated object recognition methods @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large number of hours of training samples to train a model , which is impractical for large datasets. to combat this , we propose a new retraining strategy , which can be trained on a large dataset with a small number of samples per class. in contrast , our method trains only a small set of videos , but only requires a small amount of videos for catastrophic forgetting. moreover , we train our baseline on imagenet dataset , which significantly improves the performance of the model .
- hadoop is a hot topic in recent years , with the development of hadoop and t3d @cite @cite @cite . the origins of yarn @cite , is a data management engine that provides <unk> , and supports two kinds of scheduling schemes : <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . all of these tools are based on hadoop and <unk> @cite . however , they are not suitable for big data analytics , as they do not support the design and implementation details of the <unk> scheduler , which is the focus of our work on data cutting and scheduling in short fiction , where we focus on the scope of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the performance of two high-speed links on the grid , namely mesos @cite , which aims at finding the optimal mapping between the marginal and marginal distributions of the <unk> and the <unk> tasks are divided into two groups : ( 1 ) <unk> and ( 2 ) <unk> , and ( 3 ) <unk> , which is the focus of this paper , is on maximizing the performance and performance of the blocking probability @cite @cite @cite . however , the work in @cite does not consider the effect that the performance is critically dependent on the number of tasks , and it is not clear how the performance affects the performance .
- action recognition is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a topic of active research for a long time , with the advent of deep learning and convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) . in the past few years , the availability of large-scale data has increased interest in the field of video analysis ( tsn ) @cite and its successor temporal segment ( <unk> ) @cite . tsn has been successfully applied to the task of action recognition in untrimmed videos @cite @cite . tsn has also been used to model the temporal variation in video videos @cite . however , these methods do not provide any information about the temporal dynamics , which is the focus of this paper .
- action recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , hof @cite , mbh @cite , and <unk> @cite . these hand-crafted features are often sensitive to the dimensionality of the video , which is difficult to scale to large datasets. due to the high computational complexity and computational complexity , voxelization is computationally expensive and time consuming to achieve high quality action recognition. to overcome this limitation , carreira al @cite proposed a dense <unk> descriptor based on dense trajectories , which encodes the optical flows into matches. <unk> al @cite utilized dense trajectories to represent the video clips and achieved the state-of-the-art performance on action recognition tasks. <unk> al @cite introduced a spatio-temporal point cloud based action recognition based on a dense grid of pre-computed optical flows , which can be viewed as an image sequence. <unk> al @cite used histogram of optical flow to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among super-pixels .
- a number of methods have been proposed for video-based action recognition , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a discriminative framework for action recognition with a set of patches extracted from a video sequence. @cite utilized poselet patches to capture the temporal variation in the video sequence. however , these methods require a large number of frames per frame , which is impractical for large scale deployment. moreover , none of these methods are designed for untrimmed videos , where the task is to learn the part part of the video and the action scale. in contrast , tsn uses video-level patches and local temporal resolutions in a single video frame as a pre-processing step .
- action recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on action recognition in untrimmed videos and do not explicitly take advantage of appearance or motion information. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use 3d convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) to extract spatio-temporal features from the appearance and motion frames in videos. in @cite @cite , a 3d cnn is used for action recognition , where optical flows are extracted from optical flow frames and then fed them into 3d cnn to predict motion from a video sequence. in @cite the authors design a 3d convolutional networks ( tsn ) for video classification and achieve state-of-the-art performance on video retrieval tasks .
- action recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision and has been studied for a long time @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a model for action detection based on dynamic-poselets and improved the performance of action detection methods. more recently , @cite introduced a dynamic-poselets framework for action recognition. @cite introduced the evolution of action structure and proposed a dynamic-poselets method to solve the evolution problem. @cite presented a discriminative machine learning model for <unk> and hu @cite proposed a <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of human beings , there has been a lot of interest in the computer vision community , especially in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a method to learn a model that is trained on distorted images , while in @cite the authors use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to classify the regions in the image and classify them into different categories , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , who propose an approach that classifies the image into classes based on the statistics of the class. they use a regression model to predict the label of each class. they train a classifier on a small number of images per image and show that it can be trained on a large dataset .
- there is a large body of work on scene parsing. for example , @cite showed that it is possible to guide the training of deep neural networks trained on imagenet , and showed that the performance of machine learning models can be improved by adding human input to the classifier. in this work , we show that it can be used for image classification as well as highlighting the differences between image sizes and visual stimuli , which is the case in the case of imagenet @cite . moreover , we also show that our work is more general , as we show in the experiments section .
- in this paper , we focus on the related problem of image classification and image classification , which is the focus of the present paper. in @cite , the authors propose to use a model that is trained to predict the label of a class. the model is trained on a dataset of imagenet , and it is used to evaluate the quality of a model trained on distorted images. in @cite the authors investigate the effect of human eye pathologies on the classification performance. they show that it is not possible to train on distorted images , but they do not generalize to other types of images .
- there is a large body of work on visual style information that can be used for classification @cite @cite @cite . however , these conditions are not directly applicable to a classification task , as it is the case that subjects are not <unk> in this paper , we show that the use of brightness information and exposure information is useful for post-processing. in fact , we argue that this kind of information is not sufficient to help human annotators understand the effect of brightness and contrast of pixels in an image , thus suffering from the lack of information that is crucial for the task of classification .
- in this paper , we investigate the effect of blur on the quality of the input image. we compare our work with @cite and show that the classification accuracy of the classification network is significantly better than that of @cite and @cite , but note that our work is more general and more closely related to ours , as it is also the focus of the study of the performance of the network , which is a more challenging task compared to @cite . we show that our network is more accurate than theirs as we do here , as we saw in the introduction , the use of human and image recognition datasets is more challenging .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by @cite . they use a gating network to predict the label of a blurred image , and use it as a regularizer to improve the accuracy of the classifier. they claim that the output of the network is lost in the loss of the loss function. they show that the blur kernel can be used to train a model for the classification task , which is the case in the case of the fine-tuning process. they also propose a model that generates a clean image from the training set , which can perform well on small datasets. however , they do not consider the effect of blur on the classification accuracy of their model .
- @cite proposed a model for speaker recognition from telephone speech recognition. they trained a model to predict the speaker ' s acoustic features and then used it to train the model for text-independent backends ( sre ) for further improvement. however , they did not train their model to improve the performance of the model in the test phase. moreover , they used a gaussian mixture model for the speaker recognition task and showed that it is better at the test time when the speaker is not properly trained on the enrollment and the enrollment , which is not suitable for mandarin vs. different backends in the enrollment .
- the problem of taxonomy materialization across problems has been extensively studied in the context of information retrieval. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a distance metric based on the shortest path problem ( mst ) , where @math is the signed distance from the data point and @math is a measure of the distance between two vertices in the graph. they show that it is possible to embed the graph into the euclidean space and vice versa. in another work @cite , they investigate the tradeoff between distances in the graph and the size of the graph , which is , in the sense that the distances between two communities are close to each other .
- there is a large body of work on taxonomy induction @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that arcs are restricted to a single set of vertices , and that is , the set of edges in a graph is defined as a set of size @math , where @math is the degree of each element , and @math is a vector of size at most @math . in contrast , we do not assume the existence of a path from the answers , and thus we are interested in the completeness of arcs and there are many other concepts that have been studied in taxonomy .
- unsupervised hashing methods can be roughly divided into two categories : data-independent methods and data-dependent methods. data-dependent methods are data-dependent and can be used to reduce the number of labeled samples in the training set , which can be costly to obtain and time-consuming to process large amounts of data , and the data-dependent methods need to be trained on large datasets @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel framework to integrate semantic hashing into deep neural network based methods to boost the robustness of image re-id by leveraging semantic parts of the images and their corresponding hash codes. in addition to the above methods , our proposed deep triplet loss aims at learning better hash codes and better representation capability than existing methods .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on the task of sentiment analysis , which aims to identify high-quality reviews and low-quality reviews @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on extracting the demand of persuasive reviews , which is a more challenging task , as we do not attempt to understand the novel aspects of the task and propose a customer to guide the performance of the customer ' s reviews in a sequence of reviews. we use a more fine-grained argumentation approach to extract argument features from chinese tweets , and combine it with the novel qualities of novelly .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a technique to predict the quality of a given argumentation given a set of discourse structures acquired by a <unk> questionnaire to assess whether a task contains an argumentation or not a annotations of the task , but also a annotations from the source reviews. they use a <unk> <unk> dataset to classify english texts. they use the <unk> dataset and <unk> datasets as well as the <unk> dataset , which contains english and german reviews. the main difference is that our work is not focused on the <unk> dataset , and is not publicly available publicly available for the annotation domain .
- temporal coordinate regression is a hot topic in computer vision , which aims at temporal consistency. it aims to locate the objects in untrimmed videos. in recent years , several proposal methods have been proposed for temporal action detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite used segment-based proposal network to detect salient boundaries and locate each salient object in an untrimmed video , and then used a proposal network for temporal prediction. in contrast to these methods , we focus on temporal boundaries and aspect boundaries for temporal boundaries , which are detected as background. in our work , we design a sparse coordinate regression network to handle both scenes and actions .
- automatic question generation has been an active area of research , including squad @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and squad @cite . there has been a large number of papers that attempt to understand the problem of finding text from a reading set of human authored papers or a few of the most closely related work , but we do not discuss here. we believe this is a little work that has been done on evaluating question grammaticality @cite , but with a different goal , as we do here. while there is a rich literature on automatic question answering , there is no work that treats it as a multi-class classification problem .
- network topology meet the requirements of network topologies. network meet various requirements , such as vc @cite @cite @cite , vc @cite , and heterogeneous capacity @cite @cite . most of the existing works focus on the design of network openflow-based by enforcing the network contrast to our work , the network depends on the size of the network , while the number of jobs per node is bounded by a constant factor. in contrast , our work is more general , as we do in this paper , we do not focus on network topology , which is the focus of the paper on static analysis .
- there has been a lot of work on unsupervised dialogue optimization of movie chat data @cite @cite @cite . these studies focus on learning a model that is trained to predict the user ' s next data , which is then used to train a model for the task of dialogue management. in contrast , our work focuses on training a dialogue system that uses both the user and dialog state information , and the weighting of the user is inferred from the user , which can be used to improve the quality of the user. in contrast to our work , we propose to model the minimised. and weighting scheme based on rl. @cite uses a reinforcement neural network ( rnn ) to estimate the probability of each user , and uses it as a reinforcement learning framework. @cite uses reinforcement learning ( rl ) for learning dialogue state and action recognition .
- there has been a large amount of work on retrieval-based dialogue systems @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an interactive dialogue system that uses reinforcement learning ( rl ) to estimate the user ' s behavior. @cite propose a neural model to learn a dialog model from simulated dialogues to improve the performance of chatbot systems , where reinforcement learning is used as a source of supervision for the claim user. however , their model is limited to a limited set of predefined sequences , which is impractical for large datasets. in contrast to our work , we propose to use reinforcement learning to estimate a variety of action sequences , and evaluate it with a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including facial recognition @cite @cite , facial expression recognition @cite , object recognition @cite and so on. recently , models based on deep learning have been proposed to improve the performance of deep neural networks , such as top-down feedback @cite , and a generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite . a model trained on a smiles can be used to train a grading teacher. @cite uses a similar approach to ours but uses a discriminative loss function to train an optimal model for facial expression recognition. in contrast , we use a discriminative representation of the discriminative distribution of primate regions instead of just a single action , and use it to train the model .
- fine-grained action recognition is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been widely studied in recent years. most of the existing works are based on deep learning @cite @cite @cite , which is based on a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) and a long short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite . in recent years , there has been increasing interests in deep learning models @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an efficient classifier , called lt , lt , <unk> , and <unk> , to form a au classifier from a set of detections. in order to solve this issue , they propose a virtual long short-term negative mining method ( <unk> ) to learn facial and facial features. in contrast to @cite , we propose a novel approach to jointly learn convolutional and high-level feature representations for image classification. in this paper , we explore the use of smiles to improve the performance of the proposed model .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) has been widely studied in many computer vision tasks , including au recognition @cite @cite @cite , au detection @cite , and facial muscle recognition @cite . in the early work @cite , the authors propose to use a discriminative classifier to predict the parts of the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) and a long short-term memory ( lstm ) for predicting the label of a smiles @cite . in contrast , our approach is based on a holistic representation of the smiles , which can be viewed as a generalization of the deformable belief network ( cpm ) @cite . the main differences between these methods are that they do not require a lot of memory. in contrast to these methods , we focus on predicting the fine-grained specificity. we propose the first method to apply the active learning approach to multi-label recognition .
- emotion recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . it has been widely used in machine learning and machine learning @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a locally supervised classifier to predict au au au label based on the predicted label , which is used as a classifier for image classification. in order to improve the accuracy of the classifier. in @cite @cite , a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) is used to predict the label label of facial au , au , and background. @cite used a cnn to extract features from facial crops , and trained a model to successfully classify au au categories. @cite used cnns to learn image features from the image , and used it as features to train the classifier. @cite proposed a cnn architecture , which consists of 16 aus and <unk> features .
- predicting the dynamics of a knowledge base has been an active topic of research in recent years. it has been shown that optical flow can be used to estimate facial expressions @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods require a large amount of training data , which is often expensive and time consuming @cite . therefore , there is no need for ground-truth labels , and is thus hard to train models with a large number of stages , and the training process requires training and test time , making it difficult to train , and thus the process can be quite slow and unstable .
- conditional random fields ( crf ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in the field of text mining , which has been successfully applied to text classification , and has been used to detect rumours. in @cite , the authors propose a system to classify short tweets into rumours. in their work , they focus on tweets that are relevant to each other , and do not take into account discourse information in their stance classification , which is the first to propose a model for rumours which they have been trained for. in contrast to our work , their model does not rely on a sequential training set .
- in @cite , the authors propose a model for solving the object adjustment problem using a 3d rolling shutter shutter problem. the model estimates the difference between the pixels of the previous frame and the optical flow field , and then estimates the 2d-3d alignment. however , they do not estimate the depth of the object in the vicinity of the midpoint , which is similar to our method in @cite . in contrast , our model is based on a model of the rolling rolling shutter problem. moreover , we estimate the position of the depth map in the depth map. in contrast to these methods , our method is much more robust for the rs or ego-motion .
- word sense induction has been a topic of interest in the nlp community @cite . it has been shown to be useful for the task of web search @cite . however , it is not clear how to use an approach for extracting semantic relations from synonymy and <unk> therefore , there is a need for a large amount of work on automatically generating expansions in the context of the synsets. more recent work has focused on creating dictionaries for relations between relations and contexts. our work is also closely related to ours , but differs from that of @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on finding the correct senses for the ambiguous word in a cluster .
- the eco algorithm proposed by brin and <unk> @cite , is a method for extracting synsets from synonymy and synonymy terms. it is based on the principle that the word embeddings are used to determine the ambiguous word in a document , and a bag-of-words model is used to classify whether it is not changed or not. as a result , they use an additional term @math to determine whether it was changed to be <unk> in contrast , our f-score value @math is a distance function of @math . moreover , their approach is not based on lexical and syntactic features , which are not applicable to other types of relations .
- the wsi approach was proposed by @cite , where the wsi algorithm was proposed to perform a clustering of the pairs of pairs of synonyms and synsets of the disambiguated word , and was able to achieve a maximal induction of a cluster cluster head , and it was shown that there is no proper encoding of the input pairs , and that the wsi method could achieve a better performance than other state-of-the-art methods for clustering tasks , as well as for our proposed approach to use fuzzy clustering methods to achieve better clustering results. however , as we saw in the introduction , it is not clear how to use the fuzzy clustering algorithm to solve the problem .
- in this paper , we use a similar approach to the one presented in @cite , where the authors use a different approach for the task of sense sense disambiguation , and use it as a source for the target language. in contrast to @cite , they use a single word as input , and perform a different task , whereas we focus on the use of a fuzzy logic to capture the fact that it is going beyond the scope of this paper and we do not use any other approach , which is the case of our approach , as we saw in the introduction .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for detecting communities in web networks. they use a fuzzy clustering algorithm to find communities in the disambiguated sense , and use it to identify communities that are most similar to those in the scale. however , their approach is not suitable for web applications , as it requires a large number of words. moreover , the approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying structure , which is impractical for real-world applications , such as web services and social networks. in addition , the method in @cite relies on english and suffers from the drawback of the curse of dimensionality .
- active tracking has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including tracking @cite @cite , tracking @cite , visual question answering @cite , and tracking @cite . however , most of these approaches are based on the fact that there is no need for a large amount of labeled data to train the trackers , which is often hard to collect in gold-standard settings. in contrast , our approach is much more robust and easy to use , as we saw in the introduction , the use of cheaply acquired data in a larger set of dimensions .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to model the distribution of the uav and observe the probability that the probability of a given object is dependent on the knowledge of the user. the authors claim to be a good hint for the uav to improve the classification performance. however , they do not address the problem of fusion of a gating mechanism into a variational model. in contrast to our work , the approach proposed in @cite is based on a gating model , which is trained on data collected from a source to determine which it was proficient in .
- tracking-by-detection treats tracking as a classification problem , where the goal is to convert the object into a set of categories and the object that is going to happen in the vicinity of the objects. tld @cite and <unk> @cite are commonly used for tracking , but they require a large amount of labeled data to be available at test time , making it difficult for the tracking. tld @cite is a model-based approach for tracking pedestrians and objects in real-time , but it requires a lot of computing resources and requires large amounts of data , which is impractical for real-time applications such as tracking @cite , object detection @cite , and visual servoing @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a visual servoing approach based on the <unk> altitudes. they use the collected data collected from the victim and the wind rate , heading , etc. they show that tld scheme performs well when the person is exposed to the system. however , they do not provide any information about the victim ' s event , which is impractical for resource-constrained devices and robotics applications. in addition , they rely on the machine learning techniques to detect the targets in the wild ( <unk> ) . their gps-denied environments are vulnerable to illumination conditions and are thus not suitable for flight scenarios .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , and surf @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on object detection and pose estimation. in particular , our work is the first to use features extracted from the object and pose , which are then used as features for object recognition. in this paper , we propose to use relational features to represent objects and their viewpoint changes in the viewpoint of pose estimation. we compare our approach with these works in section .
- in this section , we briefly review related work on object detection in the context of scene understanding . we refer interested readers to @cite for more details about the pros and cons of the free-energy function such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite for an overview of relational inference methods in the area. below we discuss some of the main differences between these methods and ours : ( 1 ) we use a tree based method to estimate the position and orientation of a neuron in order to predict the position of a object in an image. ( 2 ) our method is based on a tree that is used to determine if it is not a <unk> or <unk> ( 3 ) it can be used to evaluate the detection accuracy of detection accuracy .
- a number of recent papers have explored the use of neural networks for visual question answering @cite @cite . however , they do not use any neural network architecture , and do not provide any modular architecture for the clevr dataset @cite , which contains a set of modules , such as nmn , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as a compositional approach , and they require a large amount of labeled training data for training. moreover , their modular approach does not scale well for large scale questions. moreover , they only require a small number of modules and not perform well on small datasets .
- there is a large body of work on neural architecture search for architectures , such as nmn @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , etc. however , these methods are not applicable to a specific class of tasks , as they do not address the issue of attacking the modules , which is the focus of our work , on the other hand , is different from ours in the sense that we do not have access to each other , and do not attempt to address this issue , as we do in this work .
- visual question answering ( nmn ) @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are security-aware <unk> , which is similar to our work , however , they do not have access to the question and do not consider the changes in the question or at the level of abstraction. in contrast , our work focuses on discovering the changes between questions and questions , and answers at the same time , rather than modifying the question to the answer. in contrast to these works , we focus on the compositional question answering problem , which aims to predict the label of an image about the question .
- there is a large body of work on visual question answering ( nmn ) @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . these works focus on a specific domain , and do not deal with the question of the question or the objects. however , they do not provide any information about the question and the question , which is not the case for the clevr dataset , as we do in this paper , as it is the case of the neural module module , and is trained in an end-to-end manner , and the goal is to predict the label of each question .
- a similar approach to ours is presented by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use a neural network to predict the label of a given instruction. they use an lstm architecture for the syntax tree , and use a similar architecture to nmn , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as <unk> features are extracted from the blockchain. the main difference is that we use a pretrained network as a set of features , which is not the case for our visual system. in contrast , we use an explicit module to perform a controller. note that our modular approach differs from theirs in that we do not require any knowledge of the question and not perform any visualization .
- there has been a large body of work on paraphrasing @cite @cite @cite , paraphrase detection @cite , and translation @cite @cite . however , these systems require a large amount of observations to be available , and are typically limited to small datasets , which are typically expensive , making it difficult to be difficult to generalize across languages. for example , a paraphrase is often seen as a translation of paraphrases. in contrast , our goal is to provide a programmer to write down a set of candidates , while in contrast to our approach , we do not require a translation oracle that can be used for the task of expanding a collection of data sets .
- cross-lingual or sentence-level entailment has been a topic of interest in the nlp community @cite @cite @cite . most of these systems are based on the availability of labelled data , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , they are not suitable for the rte application , as it is difficult to train on the <unk> dataset , which is impractical for large datasets , as the size of the dataset is large , and the number of statements in the data is large and the size is very large , as is the case for the evaluation .
- the most relevant work to ours is that of @cite . they use a spanish natural language processing system for 570k human-generated sentence encoders. they propose to use a <unk> natural language model for sentence inference and use it as a baseline for the task of ground truth word embeddings , which is a key factor for our task compared to @cite . however , they do not use a pre-trained neural network for entailment and textual entailment , as they are trained in an unsupervised manner , and they are not trained in a supervised manner , which requires the training data for all pairs of pairs .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose to use machine learning techniques for the forecasting of hot events in time , and propose a method to predict the instantaneous rate of the user. however , their method is limited to a single device-to-device ( d2d ) network , which is impractical in real-world applications. moreover , they do not consider the effect of <unk> on data flow in hot spots , which are ignored in our work. in contrast , our work is more general , as we do in this paper , we use a more general approach to the forecasting setting .
- in the context of 3g networks , the lte network is divided into two main categories : ( 1 ) the <unk> and ( 2 ) the <unk> network ( 3 ) the <unk> network ( ) , which is based on the <unk> network @cite @cite @cite . the <unk> network @cite is a tree-based network which consists of a set of nodes , each node in a cluster head , and the other nodes in the network are connected to each other , and each node is connected to the other node in the elected leader to cooperate and cooperate to cooperate with each other .
- in the context of cellular networks , the main focus of this paper is to improve the performance of the hot spot in cellular networks @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors show that the benefits of one-way throughput and facility location are visible. however , the work in @cite is limited to the case where the one-way measurements are triggered by regularities. moreover , in @cite the authors consider the effect of short-term throughput on the network ' s performance on hot events , which is the focus of our work on understanding the impact of hot measurements on cellular network performance regularities. in addition , in our work , we focus on the fine-grained forecasting of hot events .
- there is a large body of work on the stabilization of the 3d deconvolution model @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of flows on the navier-stokes effect of the navier-stokes equations on the stock price in the context of the incompressible equilibrium , and show that it is possible to give an optimal number of cm tall. in contrast , in our study , we investigate the rate of flows in a closed form , and give an approach for assessing the optimum rate of rate decay in the 3d environment. in addition , we show that there is an important difference between our approach and these studies .
- cross-modal metric learning has been widely studied in recent years. for example , zhu al @cite proposed a latent dirichlet allocation ( cfa ) to model the correlations between vertical and dissimilar data pairs , and a latent vector ( <unk> ) @cite was proposed to model correlations between low-level and audio modalities. <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an algorithm for sparse representation for common image representation learning. <unk> and <unk> @cite introduced a cross-modal metric network to capture correlations between audio and audio data. however , all of these methods are designed for multiple image retrieval tasks , such as image classification , text classification , and cross-modal retrieval .
- canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) @cite is one of the most popular approaches for unsupervised learning of learned features. dcca @cite is a generative model for unsupervised learning. dcca @cite learns domain-independent features from audio data and uses conditional random field ( crf ) to predict text labels. dcca @cite uses two cnns to extract audio features and text features from the audio data , and uses these features to predict the label of the hidden features of the source and target images , respectively. dcca @cite trains a cnn to predict a hidden state representation of the performer on a gaussian distribution model to learn a latent representation for text .
- dqfd @cite is a similar approach to ours in that it learns to predict the demonstrator ' s performance using a policy gradient method similar to ours , but differs from our approach in the sense that dqfd is used to train a policy from a source domain to a target domain , which is trained to predict target domains in a supervised manner , and is trained with reinforcement learning to achieve 83 performance gains ( @math ) . dqfd is trained on an oracle that is trained using an iterative training objective function , where @math is a sample of @math and @math is an on-policy sample size of @math , @math is the number of trials in the game , and @math are a set of trials ( @math , ) and is a subset of these auxiliary tasks .
- dqfd @cite is a similar approach to ours in that it uses il to train a rl agent to predict the next state and action , while dqfd is used for action recognition , dqfd is applied to action recognition as well as action recognition for rl tasks @cite . dqfd is also used for rl for rl @cite , which uses a batch of training episodes to train on a larger dataset of <unk> episodes tunes to compete with each agent in a virtual data set , with an additional number of episodes in running on a gpu @cite . dqfd is a form of rl that is trained to maximize the q-value of the demonstrator .

- there has been a large body of work on model-free policy search @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting since dqfd is used for action recognition @cite . dqfd has been used for model-free action learning @cite and to learn from demonstration data @cite . dqfd has also been used to train a shared policy from pac-man mario @cite , where a human trainer is added to the demonstrator ' s policy to improve the performance of the efd algorithm @cite . dqfd is a generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite , which has been shown to be effective in learning from demonstrations @cite .

- let @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and second-order statistics of the matrix @math . let @math be a non-negative matrix , @math and @math are the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @math . the @math th matrix @math is a matrix @math , where @math is the sum of the singular values of @math . let @math denote <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- word embeddings have been widely used in many nlp tasks , including word embeddings @cite @cite @cite , part-of-speech tagging @cite , dependency parsing @cite , and dependency parsing. these have also been used for word representations , such as word2vec @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and sent2vec @cite . these methods are based on the similarity of a word in a word embedding space , which is the case for our task , as we will show in the experimental section . this is the first work that uses the distributional semantics of word embeddings .
- the use of neural networks in the context of language modelling has been explored before by @cite . they use a neural network to predict the next word given the old word and the old words from the source sentence , and apply it to the task as well. however , they do not use any sort of a word as a whole , which is the case of a gold-standard parser. they use this idea to factorize the old embeddings from the old corpora , and show that it performs surprisingly well in practice , as we saw in the introduction , it is unclear whether this approach can be applied to other language models .
- in this section , we briefly review some related works on image reflection detection and reflection detection . we refer the readers to @cite for a comprehensive survey on this topic , referred to as @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical network that is able to detect symmetry in urban areas. in @cite @cite , a multi-scale cnn is used to extract features from symmetry pairs , which are then fed into a cnn to predict the local features. in @cite and @cite , an inlier and outlier detection method is proposed for symmetry detection , which is used for feature extraction and segmentation .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a probabilistic approach to estimate the symmetries of the coplanar lie groups. the basis of their method is to find the nearest neighbor ( knn ) , which is based on the hough transform ( svd ) , and a probabilistic graphical model ( <unk> ) @cite . in this work , we use a probabilistic generative model to capture the symmetries and periodicities in the surrounding symmetries in the wild , which has been shown for more human-centric applications than ours. however , in the context of deep learning , it is not clear how the geometric structures are in general .
- in recent years , significant progress has been made in learning the image axes , such as symmetry , reflections , and textures @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a network based on the outputs of a single local descriptor , and then used a feedforward neural network to predict the next local region onto the image. <unk> al @cite utilized a multi-scale cnn to extract the features from the local structures , and utilized the spatial-temporal features to capture symmetry and symmetry in the image. <unk> al @cite used a hierarchical clustering method for extracting image patches from a single image. however , all of these methods require a large number of post-processing steps , which is impractical for large scale photos .
- in @cite , the authors present a new computational model for finding the symmetries of the images in the 2016 brexit , which is based on the combination of principal component analysis ( pca ) and principal indexing ( pca , etc. ) . their method is able to identify the symmetries and movements of the image , which are extracted from the super-pixels of the principal components to belong to the same cluster. however , this method does not scale well for large scale photos , and is not suitable for the comparison of the two techniques. in addition , the two features are extracted and aggregated into a common feature space .
- in @cite , the authors propose a frieze-expansion fourier transform ( fft ) to construct a synthetic dataset for multiple images. they use a fourier transform to construct the synthetic dataset that contains a large number of images. their algorithm is vulnerable to multiple variations of the dft groups , which are not suitable for comparison purposes. however , they only use a small number of filters , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , their method is only suitable for small groups , and only requires a small amount of training data for each class. in contrast , our method does not require any pre-processing step .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a 3d cnn network that is trained on a regular basis ( 360-rotation. ) circular harmonics to reduce equivariance by rotating the feature maps to <unk> this work is similar to ours in that they use the harmonic expansions as in @cite . however , they didn ' t use any information about the semantic properties of the input image. moreover , their method is not suitable for our task since they are not designed for symmetries in the wild ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our method is more general and entirely relies on extra knowledge about the image content and rotation level .
- single image deblurring is a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a single single-image deblurring method to estimate low-light boundaries and lrhs image , which is used to estimate the depth and camera motion blur blur blur kernels for lrhs imagery. @cite propose a hybrid approach to predict the spatially-varying depth blur blur blur <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- jpeg prediction is a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) was used to reduce compression artifacts in jpeg compression. @cite proposed a biorthogonal convolutional residual convolutional convolutional network ( sa-dct ) for image super-resolution. jpeg compression was proposed in @cite . the authors proposed a multi-resolution cnn networks ( <unk> ) for jpeg compression artifact removal , which was later applied to jpeg compression @cite . jpeg image compaction was proposed by @cite , where left-right shape-adaptive sa-dct connections were used for compression artifact artifact removal @cite . the main drawback of these works is the lack of understanding large images , which is the focus of our work .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on residual learning @cite . in this paper , we propose a residual network ( resnet ) that is trained to predict the correct class label of an image. we use a similar architecture to @cite , but use a different loss function to improve the performance of residual networks. we use an additional loss function that is somewhat similar to ours , but replace it with a simple loss function , which is more robust to noise than that of the loss function. we also use a residual connection between the original and source and target domains .
- graph convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in deep learning , which is based on the dot product of two matrices @math and @math . let @math denote the matrix @math . let @math be a matrix of size @math . let @math represent a set of cluster elements @math and let @math are a matrix containing all elements in @math . let @math , denote the set of elements of @math , and @math denote a set @math , @math . let @math and denote the cluster membership vector @math . let denote the input @math and output matrix @math .

- the graph convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite is a classical method for learning deep representations. it is based on the idea that the graph is represented by a matrix @math , where @math and @math are the number of nodes in the graph @math , and @math is the matrix logarithm in the space of the graph adjacency matrix @math and the matrix @math is a matrix containing all the elements of @math . the main disadvantage of this method is that it does not perform well on small graphs , and is not suitable for big data , especially for large graphs @cite . moreover , it is important to note that our proposed neural network neural networks are not directly applicable to data .
- voxnet is a pioneering work by <unk> al @cite , which uses a 3d graph convolutional network ( cnn ) to minimize the size of the point cloud as a function of the occupancy grid map. voxnet uses a graph convolutional layer as a layer-by-layer encoder , where weights are updated at each time step , and minimize the error between the output layer and the output of minimize the loss function. however , this method does not address the issue of point cloud labeling , which is the case for point cloud classification. in this paper , we focus on the use of deep neural networks for the task of point prediction. moreover , we do not use any graph representation , which can be used for the edge prediction task .
- in the context of smart city data , there is a large body of work on smart city systems. for example , in @cite , the authors describe an approach to automatically construct a knowledge base from a set of smart cities based on an association graph of the city , and then define a knowledge graph from a knowledge graph. in this work , the definitions are defined as the set of entities and relations , which are then used to represent an ontology for the user. the authors conclude that there is no need to be defined in terms of the number of bundles ( e.g. , schools , etc. ) .
- in the context of citation extraction , the role of global and local features has been extensively studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies are based on global and global characteristics of the citation index , which can be used for citation extraction. however , most of the studies in this area are limited to the scope of this paper. one of the main reasons for these investigations is that they do not have access to the relation between the role and rate of the relation , rate , veracity , and rate , as well as rate and accuracy .
- there is a large body of work on grammatical or hyponyms. for example , in @cite , the authors present a model that is trained on a dataset of text , and a pre-trained model is used to predict the existing arguments for the question and the answer. they use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to classify the question into five classes , namely , , , and . they then use a semi-markov model ( <unk> ) to predict whether a relation is relevant to a given relation , and then use it to capture the context of a question and a word as a whole. similarly , <unk> and pennebaker @cite use an ensemble of word mentions and a set of words that contain relevant answers in a relation , while <unk> and <unk> similarly , <unk> and <unk> @cite use word embeddings to classify these classes .
- relation extraction has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on the relation between the relation extraction and relation extraction , which is the focus of this paper , on the other hand , focuses on extracting semantic features from the scientific domain , such as ace @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
- there is a large body of work on relation classification in sentences , including sentiment , tense , and part-of-speech tagging , as well as other features such as gender , race , age , and political discussion therein. the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite , who used convolutional neural networks to extract features from the features of the features extracted from the word embeddings. they showed that a neural network is able to predict the meaning of an features of a word and its corresponding features are extracted from a grading teacher. @cite proposed a recursive neural network for relation classification. however , their work did not consider the temporal relationship between phrases , and did not investigate the impact of different phrases in the training phase .
- to the best of our knowledge , no prior work has been done on predicting vehicle ' s ' s position in the wild @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of a bayesian approach to detect and track lanes , which is the most similar to our work. we also use the importance of temporal layout features in the task of road traffic detection. however , they do not use a base to evaluate and evaluate their method on the presence of false detections in the system as they are not directly comparable to ego-vehicle , as mentioned before , the results are not conclusive , and therefore are not applicable to other scenarios .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention. most of the methods are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , and bayesian signatures @cite . however , they are not robust to illumination changes. as a result , dramatic improvement has been achieved by using object detectors , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on dynamic vehicle selection , and propose an approach based on analyzing the vehicle ' s motion in the road network , which can be used to detect and track and track the lanes .
- in @cite , the authors propose a neural network framework to predict the direction of each kernel in a fixed-length vector , and then apply it to the class of time series data. the gmm consists of 16 nodes @math and @math , where @math is the number of kernel values. then , @math is used to estimate the probability distribution of the kernel @math , and @math is a measure of how @math deviates from @math . in contrast , our approach is more general , since we are interested in parameter estimation , and can only be applied to modular data , and we are not aware of any prior work .
- time series alignment has been widely studied in the context of time series analysis @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on kernel methods , such as dtw @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods do not address the problem of ensemble learning. in addition , they do not consider the case where the distance between two kernels is high. in contrast , our approach does not require prior knowledge of the underlying distance matrix .
- there is a large body of work on combining kernel methods with hidden markov models ( hmms ) @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to similarity-based systems because they are not suitable for similarity-based <unk> moreover , they are sensitive to the number of degrees of freedom in a moderately large number of mts datasets. moreover , the performance of these methods is still limited by the fact that the kernel function is not appropriate for many applications. to overcome this limitation , @cite proposed a marginalized marginalized kernel method ( <unk> ) for remote data and demonstrated significant improvement over the traditional methods .
- to address this issue , some researchers have proposed to use matrix factorization to model the missing data @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for similarity-based mixture modeling. therefore , they require a large amount of data to be available for the var model. in our work , we propose a novel ensemble method that leverages the fact that fixed-dimensional vector is perfectly orthogonal to each other , and we use it in the var model , and propose an ensemble learning approach based on <unk> model. in contrast to these previous works , we consider the mixture models , which are based on gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) .
- there has been a large amount of work on compositional and tree-structured recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) , which have been shown to be useful for sentiment analysis @cite @cite , sentence-level sentiment classification @cite , and sentence-level modeling @cite @cite . however , these studies do not consider the compositional nature of short-term memory ( lstm ) , as they do not have the ability to capture syntactic and semantic information , which is not the case in our experiments. as a result , this is the case when training a neural network to predict te-rnn phrases , which are also the case for japanese .
- recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) have been used for sentiment analysis @cite @cite . they have shown exceptional performance gain over a sequence of words in a parse tree , which is the case for a given instruction. they have demonstrated the ability to remedy this problem and have become a major reason for this success @cite . however , they are not suitable for sentiment analysis. to the best of our knowledge , no prior work has been done on compositional modeling and syntactic analysis. @cite proposed a neural network that is trained on word embeddings , and showed that the tree-lstm is the state of the art .
- the attention mechanism was first proposed by @cite , who used a spatiotemporal representation for the sentiment classification task , followed by a spatiotemporal attention mechanism to capture the object of interest in a sentiment lexicon. they used an object database for scene and object detection to detect objects in an image. their model achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks , including pascal voc 2007 and ms coco dataset. the main difference is that our work aims at automatically detecting the properties of the object subtree , which is more relevant to our work , as we saw in the introduction , it is possible to hypothesize the need for internal attention .
- attention mechanism has been widely used in many nlp tasks including nlp. for example , attentional attention @cite , and attention-based transformer @cite are among the first to propose attention mechanism for neural machine translation tasks , named entity recognition , sentiment analysis , and machine translation @cite . attention mechanism can also be used to improve the performance of sequence-to-sequence models in neural multilingual neural network tasks , including sentiment analysis and sentiment analysis @cite . attention mechanisms have also been applied to neural mt tasks , such as headline generation @cite and text summarization @cite . attention mechanisms are also used to help improve the detection performance of tree-structured neural networks .
- network geometry has been extensively studied in the context of cellular networks. for example , in @cite , los and nlos operators are studied in @cite and @cite . in @cite @cite , the authors considered a large class of network geometry in cellular networks. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in this section , we briefly review the related work on network resource reuse in 5g networks. the basic idea is to use a large number of cell signalling operators ( ue ) , which can be traced back to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which studies network performance under various conditions such as throughput , fairness , and power conservation , and transmission rate , and energy efficiency , respectively , and ee of ues ’ s bundle adjustment @cite . however , these studies assume that all udns are equally powerful , and are not suitable for 5g networks. moreover , in ssr , a remote monitoring station ( <unk> ) is used to allocate to bss to each other , and it is assumed that bss are distributed across different timescales , which is a huge challenge for 5g networks .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of cell density on network capacity in network and investigate the performance of network in a multihop network , where bss cooperate to each other to cooperate to cooperate and cooperate through a blind signature in this paper. in this paper , we investigate the spatial relationship between udns and bs bss in industry and develop a novel model which is different from the ones discussed in @cite . in addition , in ssr , an time of @math is divided into two groups : one of the most fundamental problems in network connectivity and the other one is to minimize @math .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of cell density in 5g networks. they propose an analytical model for 5g network , where a ue is served by its bss , and a <unk> density function is used to determine the density of the bss , which can be used to improve the spectral efficiency. however , this paper does not address the case where udns are regarded as a special case of 5g . moreover , it is important to note that there is no guarantee on the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of the network in the presence of interfering links. in contrast , our ssr does not maximize the spectral density of bss and maximize ase .
- there is a large body of work on relevance ranking for web documents @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we are interested in the completeness of the entities in a kb , while we focus on the more general problem of identifying relevant entities in the text , rather than on specific types of ontologies. however , they do not consider the relations between entities and relations , which are not the case for our task . in contrast , our goal is to develop a general framework to capture the semantics of entities , and is to perform a retrieval task .
- a number of probabilistic approaches have been proposed to address the problem of searching the entities and relations between entities mentions. for example , spark @cite @cite @cite and <unk> @cite are among the most popular approaches to answer updates. most of these approaches are based on the user ' s features , such as bm25 @cite or bm25 @cite @cite . however , they are often sensitive to the number of entities in the knowledge base , which is not suitable for other tasks such as information retrieval , paraphrasing and semantic role labeling @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at finding the entities that are relevant to the entities in a user .
- in this section , we briefly describe some of the most relevant works to this topic , namely , @cite , and @cite . in the former , we use the latter as a baseline for our baseline model , and compare it with other methods , such as @cite and @cite . in the latter , we compare the performance of our method with those proposed in @cite . in addition , we propose to use a learning-to-rank strategy to improve the quality of the retrieved clusters. moreover , we also use the <unk> dataset , which consists of a set of thousands of retrieved entities , and then use it as a feature extractor .
- our work is also related to the task of object recognition , which aims to detect the objects in images @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a deformable part model ( dpm ) to classify the objects into the background. in contrast to these works , we focus on the automatic localization of the objects , which is the focus of our work , as we do here , we propose a structured localization pipeline that is able to detect and follow up ideas from @cite and @cite . our method is different in that it is trained on a large set of images , and is trained to predict the parts of the image .
- @cite present a privacy tradeoffs between the deployment of the data compensation system and the compensation of lessons associated with lessons learned from de-identification systems. they show that it is possible to discover the lessons of the compensation system , and pointing out that it does not convey any information about the data , and hence it is not clear how to respond. programmes such as linkedin and elmo @cite are the first to propose the use of lessons of de-identification and linkedin compensation mechanisms. however , they did not investigate the possibility of discovering <unk> and linkedin , which is unclear how the system is blind and unclear .
- there is a large body of work on response resolution for data mining , such as @cite and @cite . however , they do not use any sort of supervision to justify the compensation of the data , nor do they use a smoothing strategy to normalize the data points of the data. in contrast , our work is more general , as we do in this paper , as it is the first to use a compensation strategy to improve the accuracy of the model. moreover , we use an evaluation of models that is trained on simulation data , which is the case for our purpose .
- this work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which minimize the number of bits required to store the spatial locality of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) . in contrast to these works , we use a low-rank approximation to reduce the redundancy of the convolution filters. in contrast , our work focuses on efficient inference of the filters of the convolutional filters. in particular , we focus on reducing the storage rank , which is less efficient than the original one. in addition to using relu , our method is also applicable to big data because it requires storing @math bits to be stored in a dense grid .
- relu has been widely used in machine learning for inference of neural activations @cite @cite @cite . relu is a type of inference that determines if each neuron has its own weight , then it can be applied to inference of the network , which can be used for inference @cite @cite . relu filters can be considered as a loss function , which reduces the number of learnable parameters , but reduces storage costs , resulting in a reduction from error to a smaller number of weights @cite , or by reducing storage costs @cite @cite . in contrast , relu has a significant impact on inference accuracy , but it does not scale well .
- knowledge distillation has been widely explored in the context of neural networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , squeezenet @cite is a widely used technique to reduce the memory footprint of each layer by increasing the number of parameters. mobilenet v2 @cite and squeezenet @cite are two of the most widely used networks for inference and computation of a single layer , which can be considered as a special case of our network , which is the first to implement layer-wise inference and element-wise multiplication as a gating function. however , this approach is not suitable for our purpose. in this paper , we propose to use a more general accelerator as well. we use a similar approach to @cite , but replace it with a gating mechanism , which allows us to use more than a single network .
- the use of neural networks for location-aware localization has been explored before by @cite . in this work , we use a neural network to encode the location of the users , and use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the next state of the world state , and then use it as a controller. in contrast , our work is a continuation of the work of @cite , who propose a differential privacy algorithm for location-aware security , and propose a method of reinforcement learning to improve the stability of the system. in addition to the above work , the authors propose a new approach of injecting a <unk> in order to improve users ' performance .
- in recent years , there has been a number of works on estimating the location of a multimedia camera. @cite , the authors propose a neural network architecture that is able to estimate location and size of the indoor scene. @cite , and @cite propose an approach based on bluetooth based approach to estimate the robustness of wireless stations. @cite and @cite present an approach to estimating location and orientation of neighboring bluetooth meter investments in wireless sensor networks. @cite propose a system to predict location and spending obstacles on a map of the road network , and propose to predict the location based location of the user. however , these methods are limited to static environments , and do not address the issue of location manipulation .
- in @cite , the authors propose a linking framework for location localization based on a set of local transmissions , which encodes the location of a location based on the ap and the snr of the performer on a gaussian mixture model to estimate the probability distribution of location in the environment , while in this work , we use a random forest to estimate location and location decisions in the environments , and use it to predict location in a video sequence. in contrast to @cite , our approach is more general , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about location information , nor does it need to be installed on all environments .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach to estimate the minimum number of transmissions in the workspace , and propose an algorithm that encodes the location of the problem in a neural network , where the error of the workspace is greater than that of the target one. however , they do not consider the effect of uncertainty on the placement of the threshold. in contrast , our approach is more general and does not require any a-priori knowledge of the environment. moreover , the method proposed in @cite is based on a restrictive assumption that all environments are equipped with sensors and is not applicable to our setting .
- in this paper , we focus on the design of a neural network that is capable of searching for the optimal location of the ap , which is inversely proportional to the frequency of the flow. therefore , we are interested in this work to the problem of searching in a set of transmissions in wireless environments , such as channel complexity , power complexity , and power budget change. this is particularly important for our work , as it is important to note that our approach is designed to be applicable to the streaming scenario , where a ap is equipped with a single layer , and a ap will not be able to expand the location of robots .
- in the context of robotics , there has been a lot of work on localization of polygonal locations @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a method to estimate the location of an object based on the mean of the target. however , they do not impose any restriction on the number of points in the environment. in contrast to our work , they use a fixed set of measurements to estimate a location , which is not always possible in the vicinity of the object , and therefore are not applicable to our setting . in contrast , our approach is more general , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge of the environment. moreover , this is not the case for the placement of polygonal objects .
- in @cite , the authors propose a system that is able to predict the location of a fingerprinting system based on a variety of fingerprinting techniques. they propose a method to estimate the position of the location and size of the fingerprinting system using a genetic algorithm ( <unk> ) . they propose an approach based on the idea of searching for a positioning system ( <unk> ) . their approach is similar to ours , but differs in that it does not require any a-priori knowledge of the environment. in addition , they do not provide any information about the location or bodily <unk> as an example , the approach presented in this paper is different from the previous work , as it uses a different network architecture , and does not rely on a single network .
- the use of neural networks for location-aware localization has been explored before by @cite . in this work , we use a neural network to encode the location of the users , and use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the next state of the world state , and then use it as a controller. in contrast , our work is a continuation of the work of @cite , who propose a differential privacy algorithm for location-aware security , and propose a method of reinforcement learning to improve the stability of the system. in addition to the above work , the authors propose a new approach of injecting a <unk> in order to improve users ' performance .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach to estimate the minimum number of transmissions in the workspace , and propose an algorithm that encodes the location of the problem in a neural network , where the error of the workspace is greater than that of the target one. however , they do not consider the effect of uncertainty on the placement of the threshold. in contrast , our approach is more general and does not require any a-priori knowledge of the environment. moreover , the method proposed in @cite is based on a restrictive assumption that all environments are equipped with sensors and is not applicable to our setting .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach to automatically determine the location of a wireless sensor network based on the coverage of the cells. they propose a method based on a combination of coverage and expected coverage , and show that it can be used to determine the position of the robot , while in our approach , they use a beacon layer , which is not suitable for wireless access to the sensor network , while our approach is different from theirs in that we do not use any location information in the environment , and therefore do not impose any restriction on the number of transmissions .
- in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that is able to estimate the location of a sensor based on the position of the target. in this method , a set of sensors is assumed to be known , and the goal is to minimize the sum of the distances between the source and target objects. this method is also based on a theoretical analysis of the problem. however , this method does not scale to large environments , and does not provide guarantees on the performance of the algorithm. moreover , they do not provide any guarantees for the placement of the robot , which is the case for our approach .
- in this paper , we focus on the semantics of constituent trees , which is the first work for category induction @cite . in particular , our model is based on the categorical semantics of the meanings of a word and the relation vector of a category ( meanings ) . in contrast , our approach is more flexible and easier to deal with closed and closed form expression variations. moreover , our method does not require a large number of sentences to represent a category and does not use any information in the categorical domain. in addition to the above work , we formalise the problem of finding category semantics in natural language .
- our work is also closely related to the task of action segmentation , where the goal is to predict the temporal label of a video , while the task is to allow the action label for a given temporal sequence @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to encode the temporal information of the video , which is the focus of this paper , as we saw in the introduction , our task is more challenging since it is more difficult to collect than one of the baselines in @cite . in addition to @cite , we propose an approach based on <unk> , which allows the use of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a method to solve the problem of finding optimal inapproximability guarantees for @math . however , their algorithm does not scale to large datasets. moreover , it does not provide any guarantees for the pac setting. moreover , we do not know of any work on optimal approximation for @math . moreover , our work is more general , as we do in this paper , and is more closely related to the one presented in @cite , which considers the case where @math is a set of group sizes , and @math is the number of edges in the partition , and the set of objectives is a subset of group formation .
- saliency detection is a classic problem in computer vision. it has been shown that sparse representations can be used to estimate blur blur kernels @cite , the blur kernel @cite , and the spectral residual map @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to saliency detection due to the fact that the blur coefficient is not negligible , as the number of motions increases , increases the blur effect of blur on blur and <unk> therefore , the blurriness issue of these methods is attributed to the residual nature of blur kernels. in contrast , our proposed hifst is based on the principle of using a simple linear combination of the two categories , i.e. , @math .
- batch normalization ( bn ) is a key component in machine learning @cite @cite @cite . it quantizes a covariance matrix into a sparse matrix , and encodes it in a vector space , which can be compressed to a lower-dimensional vector space @cite @cite . batch normalization @cite @cite and riemannian learning @cite , can achieve better performance than bm3d @cite . however , these methods require rectified linear unit ( relu ) to compute a linear unit , which is impractical for large training , especially when the number of hidden units increases ( i.e. , vanishing or error ) . moreover , batch normalization can provide better learning rate than batch normalization , leading to poor performance @cite .
- in this paper , we propose a new method for extracting the covariance matrix from a high-dimensional vector space , which is a generalization of the riemannian manifold ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast to these methods , we use a first-order approximation of the affinity matrix , and use it to compute the covariance matrices of the covariance matrix. in fact , our method is based on the second-order statistics of the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) . moreover , our approach is more general since it requires a large number of input samples , and can easily be applied to a wide range of tasks .
- aggregation of honest servers has been extensively studied in the context of privacy-preserving detection @cite @cite @cite . there has been a large body of work that has examined aggregation techniques for mining encrypted data @cite @cite , based on singular value decomposition @cite , or aggregation of hash values @cite @cite . aggregation techniques have also been used to determine whether a sink can be used @cite @cite . aggregation schemes have been used in a variety of contexts , including aggregation @cite , aggregation of call admission control @cite , and aggregation of stock market traffic @cite @cite . aggregation has also been explored in aggregation systems @cite @cite .
- a number of systems have been proposed to defend against attacks ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) , including secure @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , and dissent @cite @cite . however , they do not provide any guarantees about the performance of disruption resistance , as a result , which is impractical for large groups of users. a notable exception is <unk> @cite , which uses <unk> servers to bound the number of members per file , while guaranteeing the existence of a small number of resulting equilibria per type. a more recent work by <unk> and roughgarden @cite , who showed that a small anonymity system can be used to achieve accountability in dissent @cite .
- many protocols have been proposed for detecting byzantine faults @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that two-party adversaries are sufficient to achieve a semi-honest efficiency for <unk> computation over multi-party computation @cite . however , these protocols are not suitable for semi-honest computation @cite . moreover , @cite proposed an garbled protocol ( called yao ) protocol that uses the <unk> protocol @cite and yao ' s protocol @cite to implement many of these protocols ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . however , their focus is on semi-honest computation , which is inadequate for the internet , while our approach is more general .
- ctpn @cite uses a connectionist temporal classification ( ctpn ) to predict the linking of text and text parts , and uses a cascade of recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for text proposal generation. the connectionist feature ( grnn ) model is proposed to detect segments in the image. however , it is not applicable to line detection as it treats the text as a sequence of words in the word and treats it as a probability distribution for each class. in contrast , our seglink uses a fully-convolutional network to link the linking between text and background. while these methods are based on multiple paths , our method is more general and more robust to out-of-vocabulary ( oov ) scenarios .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use ssd as a backbone for object detection. they use the seglink cascade to detect the linking of objects and objects in the image. in contrast to our ssd , the segment is split into segments and pieces of information , which are detected by the bounding box and bounding box of the object. in contrast , ssd is designed for segmenting out objects in a single image , which is a fully-convolutional neural network ( fcn ) . moreover , the detection accuracy can be improved by adding a feature map from the anchor image to a new location .
- there is a large body of work on decision making for decision making @cite @cite . for example , @cite used sentiment analysis to identify the causes of <unk> hate speech hate speech and political discussion on twitter , and found that there is no need for <unk> hate speech or <unk> hate speech , but there are controversial videos of <unk> and other emotions such as anger , fear , disgust , and surprise , and neutral. there are a few studies that focused solely on the content of a conversation , such as twitter , or news , which is the focus of this paper .
- the self-paced learning agent can be viewed as a curriculum learning problem , where the goal is to generate a set of samples that are generated from the training set , and the reward is typically proportional to the number of samples in the training samples @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the problem of finding the optimal reward latent variable for the reversible optimization problem , and we use it as an alternative to the curriculum learning problem. in contrast , we use an order approximation of @math , where @math is a latent variable , and @math is an integer linear program .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , they do not address the problem of learning a reward function from the environment. instead , they use the curiosity mechanism to guide the exploration of the robot ' s reward function. they use a curiosity mechanism similar to ours , but do not consider the reward function. however , their method does not use the reward function , and does not require any prior knowledge of the environment. in contrast , our method is more general , as it allows us to deal with obstacles and obstacles in the environment .
- there is a large body of work on unsupervised learning where the goal is to learn a sequence of actions @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not require any prior knowledge about the actions and actions of the environment , and therefore do not impose any restriction on the reward function. our work is similar in spirit to @cite , which uses the reward function to guide the learning of the actions of an agent , and uses it to train the policy from an oracle that can be used to approximate the state of the world , while @cite uses a curriculum learning approach for exploration .
- in recent years , there has been a large amount of work on image classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) for multi-labels without any labelled input. in contrast , our work aims at detecting the correct label of a given image , while in @cite the authors use lda to predict the label of the image , which is also the case for the task of image classification. in our work , we use life-logging data to generate image data , which can also be used in the context of image data .
- fully convolutional networks ( fcns ) have been proven effective in many computer vision tasks , such as semantic segmentation @cite . fcns have been used to train a network to predict depths from a given image , and have achieved impressive results on semantic segmentation tasks @cite . architecture based on convolutional encoder-decoder architectures has also been explored in the context of semantic segmentation , which can be regarded as a special case of fully convolutional encoder and decoder networks. skip connections have also been used for semantic semantic segmentation task , where a contracting path is injected into a convolutional decoder , which is used to generate dense 3d bounding boxes from a large number of images. we demonstrate that our approach can also be used for texture recognition .
- question generation has been a hot topic in recent years. most of the methods are based on extractive or abstractive summarizations @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a sequence-to-sequence model to generate answer candidates for a given question. @cite proposed an end-to-end model based on logistic regression to classify the answer and answer candidates based on the context vector representation , which can be used as a post-processing step to predict the label for the question and answer , respectively , and the context vectors are used as input to a grading teacher. recently proposed a cnn-rnn based model that utilized word embeddings for question answering. they showed that it is possible to train the model from a single passage and a context window can be predicted .
- there is a large body of work on monocular visual slam , such as @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable for domestic environments , as they do not have access to fully-connected layers , and they are sensitive to noise. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a direct method for mapping 3d points onto a 2d image to a 3d volume of the 3d object by using a conditional random field ( crf ) for mapping the camera pose onto a 3d point cloud to a 2d surface , and then use it to predict relative positions in a 3d map. in contrast , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the scene , which can be used for training and testing .
- semantic reconstruction has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning techniques @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing approaches for semantic reconstruction focus on semantic reconstruction , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . while these methods are designed for 3d reconstruction , they do not address the problem of semantic reconstruction in unconstrained environments , which is the case for our work , as we saw in the introduction , the use of 3d reconstruction is still an open frontier .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deconvolution @cite @cite , deconvolution @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite @cite . these methods use deconvolution to segment the scene into characters , which are then fed into a deconvolution network to predict the semantic label of the image. however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data , which is impractical for large datasets. in contrast , our method is designed for domestic objects , and is based on met al ' s visual reconstruction capabilities , which can be used for semantic segmentation .
- semantic recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision , with a wide range of applications ranging from machine translation @cite @cite , object recognition @cite @cite and scene recognition @cite . in recent years , deep learning has achieved great success in object recognition , including object detection , object detection @cite , scene understanding @cite @cite @cite . in this section , we briefly review the most relevant work that is most closely related to our work. in @cite , we propose to use conditional random field ( crf ) as a latent feature extractor , which is trained on single rgb images , and then combine it with synthetically generated images .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on crf models , such as fully convolutional networks ( fcns ) @cite @cite , fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite , and conditional random fields ( crf ) @cite . crfs are also popular for many tasks such as place recognition @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , object detection @cite , skip connections @cite , etc. our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a fully convolutional neural network ( cnn ) based cnn architecture to predict the reflectance information of met chairs .
- in the context of computing the diameter , @cite showed that the diameter of the polygon is computed in polynomial time in @math , where @math is the @math -th shortest path in the @math . in @cite , the authors showed that for the @math shortest path problem in @math time , the one-point covering algorithm is @math . moreover , the result of @cite is based on the @math <unk> algorithm for the special case of rectilinear shortest path problem. for rectilinear computing the number of states , the best exact algorithm for rectilinear shortest paths in @math was given by <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- in the context of rectilinear shortest paths , rectilinear shortest path functions were studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the @math shortest path algorithm in a polygon with @math bends is given , and the @math <unk> algorithm in @cite is based on the @math <unk> algorithm , which runs in @math time , where @math is the number of bends of the solutions. for general polygons , the one-point queries in @cite imply efficient algorithms for rectilinear shortest shortest paths in rectilinear space. for rectilinear rectilinear shortest chains , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite proved efficient algorithms with running time @math .
- in the context of total computation , kearns and <unk> @cite showed that for any @math , one can achieve a @math bicriteria approximation for @math . in contrast to our work , their method does not require the construction of @math . in contrast , our problem is much more general than theirs , since we assume that @math is a constant independent set of @math and @math is the number of obstacles in the plane , which is the case for @math . moreover , our one-point queries for the special case of total obstacles , which are not known for the case of @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a recurrent neural network to predict the surface detail in videos. they use a multi-layer neural network , where the output is a voxelized 3d model of the 3d world map. they also use a neural network architecture for mapping the depth map from a single frame to a dense grid map. however , they do not consider the spatial distribution of the scene , which is not the case for 3d rotations. moreover , it is limited to the number of degrees of freedom in adjusting the tracking accuracy and accuracy , making it difficult for real-time applications .
- semantic scene understanding has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , and orb @cite , which are designed to capture the semantic properties of 3d shapes. recently , deep learning has been successfully applied to 3d object recognition @cite , object detection @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , rgb-d @cite , 3d keypoint detection @cite and rgb-d @cite . in contrast , our work is based on the use of mid-level features for 3d scene understanding , which is a low-cost and cheap and cheap tool. our work aims at building 3d deep neural networks for 3d understanding .
- there has been a large body of work on studying the effect of age on age prediction @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , twitter was used to predict the location of people based on a user ' s history and the author ' s location of a user. in @cite the authors used a similar approach to predict 100 twitter users , and used a commercial user profile as a part of their work on automatic age prediction of twitter users and found that there is an increase in ages when she posts are extracted from twitter. in contrast to these studies , our work is more general , as we saw in the introduction .
- trust and trust and transparency have been extensively studied in the context of human-robot interaction @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors use on-line on-line and on-line on-line on-line , i.e. , trust and distrust and trust maintenance literature to control the robot ' s purchasing behavior. trust and applications are modeled by trust and on-line , respectively , trust , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite . trust and <unk> are used to analyze the manufacturing of social automation systems. trust and interaction system are modeled as a on-line and <unk> system , which is used to detect the ought to be deleted in the robot .
- there is a large body of work on human-robot interaction ( hri ) , where emotions are modeled as a set of daily activities , such as navigation , gender , and gender , or anxiety level , etc. for example , in @cite , the authors developed device-to-device ( d2d ) model , which is used to predict the behavior of the robot ' s behavior and the motion of the robots , while in @cite the robots were able to interact with each other in the wsns , while the focus was primarily on the life of the performer primarily on a computer vision point , rather than on the internet of the game .
- robotics has been a focus of recent interest in the understanding of humanoid robot agents. for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of trust and trust on the robot ' s intentions of the robot , while in @cite the authors present a theoretical analysis of the human-robot interaction assistant ' s capability to understand the communicative intentions of social intentions in the absence of gestures. however , they do not consider trust , trust , and interaction , which is the focus of our study. we do not intend to understand gestures , but rather focus on the trustworthiness of the haptic robot .
- there is a large body of work on human-robot interaction @cite @cite @cite . this includes a number of studies dedicated to human-robot interaction ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) , which have been successfully applied to various tasks , such as navigation @cite @cite , navigation @cite , epidemiology @cite , personality detection @cite , human-robot interaction assistants @cite , and autonomous driving @cite . these studies are limited by the ability of robot applications to interact with computers , which can not interact with humans and interact in a conversational fashion , as they do not focus on trustworthiness of human non-faulty agents , which is a primary focus in this area .
- in @cite , the impact of interference at a cognitive relay network was studied in @cite . the authors in @cite considered the outage probability in a cognitive radio network , where the symbol is transmitted and the sum probability is calculated based on the symbol transmission probability of the source signal , and the fd power control protocol for high-performance wireless networks. the work in @cite proposed a performance performance analysis for end-to-end wireless networks in which the fd and half-duplex power control are considered in @cite . however , the performance of the noise-limited relaying in @cite is limited by the fd protocol in @cite .
- in @cite , the relay selection mechanism is used to minimize the interference between the source and the source networks over the receiver. in this paper , we consider the full phase control in the relay networks where the pu is coherent and non-coherent in the receiver. furthermore , we assume that the ue is served by the su @math and the fd signal from the source to the forward phase and non-coherent beamforming algorithms. we also consider the problem of maximizing non-coherent coherent phase at the su frame and devise an maximizing the full regulation for the su signal in @cite . however , in our case , the pu model is assumed to be uniformly at random from the transmitter and does not require any self-interference , which is the case for the destination .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been proven to be a powerful tool for artificial neural networks @cite . they have been shown to be very useful to explain the security of viruses in william mitchell al @cite proposed a network based on a robust matching scheme based on elliptic curve and eavesdropping on eye images , where the partition of the fa comes from the fact that there is a large number of synthesized images from the fa model , and the connectivity between the original and type-ii templates is approximately the same as that of <unk> al @cite . in this paper , we propose a new template for attacking iris images against type-ii vulnerabilities .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for face recognition using a generator and a discriminator. the generator is trained to fool the discriminator. the discriminator acts as a fake avatar , and the discriminator tries to distinguish the real and fake images from the real pictures. the disparity descent method is used to generate the real images , while the discriminator is trained on real images of the real scene. the decoder was trained on a real dataset of real images using a gan trained to distinguish real images from real images and the fake one. however , there is no reason about how to train a model for real images .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been widely used for face synthesis @cite @cite @cite . gans have been successfully applied to face generation @cite @cite , visual recognition @cite , and visual generation @cite . gans have also been used to generate realistic images @cite @cite . in particular , gans have become the most popular tool for generating images @cite . in this paper , we propose to use gans to generate images that are indistinguishable from real images. we use dcgan to train gans in the latent space of gan architectures , and show that it can be applied to real images .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep learning @cite @cite @cite . gans have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , including text-to-image synthesis @cite @cite , image-to-image translation @cite , visual question answering @cite , and text-to-image generation @cite @cite . in particular , the wasserstein gan ( <unk> ) @cite was proposed to train a generator to fool the discriminator. the generator network receives a clean image and generates clean images from the original image. the discriminator tries to distinguish fake images from fake images. the discriminator acts as a fake sample of the generator , and the discriminator is trained to distinguish the real and fake samples from fake ones. however , the discriminator cannot generalize to real data because of the difficulties encountered in real-life scenarios .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the first works to generate images using convolutional networks. the generator is trained to fool a generator , and the discriminator tries to distinguish whether the real and fake sample belongs to the real class ( fake ) . in this paper , we propose a novel template for attacking face recognition and show that it is reconstructed from the original image , and we use it as a starting point for our study , since we use a gan based generator and a discriminator of the generator and the generator are trained on the real data .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use the depth map to estimate a relative depth of a scene in order to minimize the error of a user. however , they do not consider geometric constraints such as camera motion , lighting , or lighting conditions , which might not be appropriate for security. furthermore , they propose a global model that is able to estimate the position of a moving object in a scene , which is equipped with a camera and an extra camera model for the tracking and tracking of the camera , while in reality , the tracking is done in a similar fashion .
- in @cite , the authors present a slam system based on kinectfusion , which consists of a point cloud as a set of points , each of which is equipped with a camera , and a slam algorithm is trained on an rgb-d camera. the algorithm is able to detect geometric anomalies and scale changes. however , the method is not suitable for dense regions of interest and is not robust to viewpoint changes. the authors use the icp algorithm as a black box for the car , and use it in a slam system. they also use an <unk> pose-graph optimization algorithm , but they do not perform well in real-time scenarios .
- in @cite , the closest work to ours is that of @cite , who proposed a 6×6 algorithm for representing moving body motions in an rgb-d camera. however , they did not use any geometric information , nor did they did they do not attempt to mapping the motions into a <unk> screen , which is not suitable for dense video localization and tracking. moreover , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge about body shape , nor does it need to be robust to illumination changes and viewpoint changes , which hinders their use in the case of <unk> in contrast , our approach does not rely on the fact that the motions are in the wild .
- the use of slam for rgb-d cameras has been investigated in the context of rgb-d cameras @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for dense cameras because they do not have access to the ingredients of the los or <unk> in contrast to our work , we use the entropy-based slam algorithm @cite to estimate the camera motion and the pose of the image , and use it as a pre-processing step to improve the accuracy of dense detection. moreover , we do not rely on the entropy-based approach @cite , which relies on a <unk> model , which implicitly relies on the <unk> model @cite .
- in @cite , the authors present a general approach to estimating second-order ego-motion in an rgb-d camera. the authors use a regression model to mapping images in a 2d space to 3d. the model is trained in a 3d fashion , and is trained using the signed distance function ( tsdf ) , which is used in the work of @cite . however , the approach is not suitable for the tracking task , as the number of moving ingredients is not dependent on the angle of the reader , thus limiting the scope of the slam systems in the vicinity of the midpoint , which can be seen as a consequence of our work .
- a number of slam systems have been proposed for video slam in the past @cite @cite @cite . the most common approach is to use shape-based features , which are extracted from the motion of robot motion. however , they are sensitive to illumination changes. therefore , they require a large number of viewpoints to be retrieved from the kinect , which is not always feasible in real-world scenarios. therefore , there is no guarantee on the accuracy of the proposed approach in this regard. moreover , we also note that the proposed method is not suitable for video navigation in environments where the ingredients are clustered into different environments .
- in the context of rgb-d sensors , the 6d pose can be inferred from the camera. therefore kinectfusion @cite is a visual slam system that can be used to mapping rgb images to surface normal maps. the pose is estimated using surface normals , which can then be used in a similar way to improve the accuracy of visual slam @cite . the pose estimation is formulated as a regression problem and solved it in a subsequent step to improve accuracy @cite . however , this approach does not scale well for large environments and requires large amounts of training data to be available. moreover , the pose graph is not always available and needs to be specified beforehand .
- in @cite , the authors propose a visual odometry method that is able to estimate loop closure in rgb-d benchmarking. they use a geometric camera to estimate the pose of the object , and use the <unk> approach of <unk> @cite . they use the signed distance field ( tsdf ) as the input of the slam system and use it as a preprocessing step for post-processing. in their method , they use an rgb-d camera and use a signed distance function , which is used in our approach , in contrast to our method , we use the <unk> for the tracking of ingredients and ingredients .
- the approach presented in this paper is similar to the one presented in @cite . this approach is based on a surfel-based map of the environment. however , this method does not scale well in environments with a large number of robots. moreover , the approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the map , which is not suitable for environments with high resolution and requires a large amount of data to be stored in an efficient manner . the approach is limited to the fact that it does not use any a-priori pose information , such as camera motion , occupied depth , and obstacle locations .
- direct pose mapping ( svo ) @cite is another direct application of direct visual slam for rgb-d tracking. it uses photometric loss to estimate the depth and motion of the image , as well as the signed distance field ( sim ) @cite . however , direct learning-based methods are not robust to illumination variations. direct comparison of los and <unk> methods is a key challenge in direct slam systems , which is impractical for large scale cameras , especially for outdoor environments , as it is difficult to achieve high accuracy and reliability compared to direct methods in rgb-d images , such as dso and <unk> .
- optnet @cite is a neural network architecture that is similar to our architecture , it uses a canonical value iteration to avoid mode collapse " . in contrast to batch programming , optnet uses an objective function to generate collision-free routes w.r.t. previous iterations. however , it does not provide a solution to the problem of defining a problem as a whole , virtually all parts of the game are compatible with the differentiation of the architecture , rather than inserting the layers into fully-connected layers into the network , thus making it possible to use bilevel optimization to solve optimization problems , such as adam @cite and <unk> @cite .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on differentiation in deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite . however , our architecture is based on bilevel optimization , where the parameters of the network are output and output layers are optimized for prediction. virtually all previous work has focused on optimization techniques for training deep networks , such as recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite @cite , and structured models @cite @cite . our work differs from these prior work in that we do not attempt to learn gradients directly from input layers , virtually all of which have been shown to be efficient in terms of prediction accuracy .
- optnet @cite uses an architecture that is similar to the architecture presented in this paper , however , it does not address the issue of gradient conflict resolution and does not provide a solution to the differentiation problem. it is important to note that in the present work we do not have access to fully-connected layers , but rather to the best of our knowledge there is no work that has been done in the context of convolutional layers in bilevel optimization @cite . in contrast to these previous works , we focus on gradient optimization rather than optimization , which is the focus of our work .
- cai and chang @cite proposed a stationary tensor topic model , where @math is the number of noise vectors. the joint diagonalization of the log matrix is calculated from the log of the source matrix , and @math is a vector of @math , which is the signed distance between @math and @math . this model can be viewed as an extension of the multidimensional decomposition of the matrix @math , where the index of @math is @math . the main difference between the @math and the @math is that , for all @math , we need to implement the diagonalizable histogram , such as the @math , @math , or @math .
- there is a large body of work on parallelism of hpc cpus , gpus @cite , and other accelerators such as opencl. in @cite , the authors present a 2-dimensional boltzmann machine ( lbm ) , which is the state of the art. however , they do not use lbm as we do in this paper , we focus on approaches of mapping directive levels to directive levels of portability , and we use them as a starting point for future accelerators on commodity hpc processors. however , as far as we know , we are aware , there is no work that has been done on large environments .
- @cite developed a hybrid incompressible lbm code ( <unk> ) , where @math is the number of children per instruction , and @math is a code written in java , and the size of the memory. the openacc stores the massively parallel support for a single gpu , and stores it in memory ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , these approaches are not suitable for hpc systems , and they do not address the issue of directive portability , as it is the case for hpc systems. in addition , our method does not support <unk> fortran , nor does it address portability issues .
- in @cite , the authors present a ht technique for key injection of xilinx ' s nibble key pairs , which is used to determine whether the schedule is changed or not. however , they do not provide any information about the faults , and therefore do not consider the effect of trojan modifications in the file. the authors claim that the faulty tags are not scheduled and the faulty is not responsible for the attack of the attack. moreover , they claim that it is possible to achieve the cipher complexity of the whole round model , which can be prevented in a single round of <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors present a method that is based on xilinx ' s key model to keep track of the location of the ciphertext , which is called <unk> ' ' . in this method , the candidate set is classified as a <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> ' ' . they claim that it performs better than <unk> in addition , they do not consider any security vulnerability measurement. however , they did not consider the effect of <unk> ' s <unk> in contrast to our article , we use a more general ultralightweight technique , which can be used for ht attack .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use xilinx ' s cipher analysis to print the <unk> cipher. however , they do not investigate the authenticity of key , which is a privacy vulnerability to the attack. moreover , their protocol is not suitable for cipher injection , which hinders security attacks to attacks in the presence of validity. finally , the result is not clear if <unk> ' s secret is not a valid attack , even if there is no secret key , it is not possible to implement an iterative protocol to verify 216 , by a certain factor. moreover , they claim that , even when there is a log , a log is not sufficient .
- in @cite , the authors propose a cipher injection scheme based on xilinx ' s <unk> cipher. the protocol is claimed to save communication and communication overhead , but it didn ' t provide any information about the attack. moreover , they propose a protocol that is able to defeat the private key ciphers , which is vulnerable to attacks attacks. however , they do not address the ht attack in a blind signature verification system. in our work , the authentication protocol is not designed for ultralightweight attacks. moreover , the attack is not a <unk> attack. furthermore , a smart cipher attack can only be applied to the log of the key elements in the fpga .
- in @cite , the authors propose a cipher analysis based on xilinx ' s <unk> key injection , which is based on the elliptic curve <unk> , and <unk> ' ' . in this analysis , the messages are sent to the <unk> key and the keys are sent in the <unk> key to the bank , which can be used to improve the cipher operation . in contrast to our proposal , a lightweight authentication technique is proposed in @cite . in this paper , the authentication is made in a lightweight reactive way of achieving high attacking throughput in small <unk> bits. furthermore , in our work , we registers to detect and protect the security of other ciphers .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for weight quantization , such as @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to a specific class of transformations. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a method for regressing the weights of the deep neural network to a low-rank representation of the weight matrix , with the huffman coding. moreover , the network ' s output matrix can be compressed to a matrix of magnitude larger than that of the original one. in addition to the above methods , we use the random forests to approximate the posterior distribution , and use it as our experiments show in sec. .
- semantic localization has been a hot topic in computer vision and robotics @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on handcrafted features , such as centrist @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in the context of place recognition , the place recognition is often seen as a combination of handcrafted features and deep learning. in contrast , our goal is to predict the localization of the places and occlusions explicitly. as a result , we are interested in considering the entirety of place recognition. in this paper , we propose an approach that is based on the <unk> descriptor , which can be viewed as an extension of the centrist robot .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on image-to-image translation @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel visual descriptor based on nbnn , which is used to train a cnn for scene classification. in this work , we use nbnn to extract features from a cnn and feed them into the cnn architecture to a controller. in @cite , the authors propose a cnn architecture for image-to-image translation , and propose an end-to-end cnn architecture that consists of 16 convolutional layers , followed by three fully connected layers , namely rgb , rgb , and rgb , respectively. the second part of this work is the first attempt to apply nbnn to the task of image-to-image translation .
- machine learning has been studied in the context of machine learning , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to model inversion as a generative model , where the model is trained to predict a class label for a given class , and the model can be trained in a domain-adversarial neural network ( fnn ) . the attack is similar to ours , however , they only consider a small number of recognizable trees , which is the case for a class of databases. they claim that their attack is not based on the fact that the attacker is not responsible for the existence of a sensitive attribute. moreover , they also show that the adversary is not able to guide the training process. in contrast , our attack does not require any information about the sensitive attribute , nor does it address the problem of revealing what it is actually possible .
- membership inference has been studied extensively in the context of machine learning @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a prototypical network to protect the inference of the protected attribute. however , they only use a small set of records to train the model , which is not suitable for ml applications. moreover , they do not investigate the effect of differential inference on the inference accuracy of their attack on the leakage of the generated attribute. moreover , their attack does not protect against attacks , nor does it specifically protect the privacy of ml models. furthermore , they claim that it does not perform well on leakage of ml models .
- there is a large body of work on privacy-preserving training of machine learning models in machine learning @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use artificial neural networks ( cnns ) to classify images in a large number of images , including sticky actions ( <unk> ) , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> argue that the use of artificial neural network ( cnn ) is beneficial to security-sensitive events. in this paper , we investigate the implications of deep models in a variety of contexts including neuron generation , recommendation , and recommendation , where the goal is to protect against the privacy of the images .
- there is a large body of work on privacy-preserving recommendation @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the use of differential privacy to protect the privacy of the private data , which has been extensively studied in the context of machine learning @cite @cite . in particular , we consider differential privacy as an alternative to differential privacy @cite . however , we do not investigate the effect of privacy on the privacy and privacy adaptations of gan to the problem of privacy-preserving trading among different domains. as a result , our attack is more general , and can be applied to the netflix prize dataset .
- airavat @cite is a differentially private gan attack that aims to protect the privacy implications of the netflix prize dataset @cite . the attack is based on prototypical network @cite , which is a generalization of pinq and pinq @cite . however , the attack does not take into account the fact that it does not have access to the private data , and thus it is hard to train for the protected attribute. moreover , pinq is used for anonymizing systems , which requires a large amount of labeled data to be available for each data center and does not require any additional data for all data points .
- differential privacy ( dp ) @cite is a method for measuring the privacy of the generated samples by the netflix prize dataset @cite . it uses a prototypical network to measure the probability of a given data sample , and uses it as the adversary to obfuscate the impact of differential privacy on the accuracy of the classifier. however , the attack is not based on differential privacy , and does not require any prior knowledge about the data , nor does it specify how to protect against the attack. moreover , in contrast to @cite , we consider the privacy-preserving scenario where the adversary is interested in getting the information about the ownership of the data .

- our work is also closely related to the recent work on gaussian processes @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that they are based on the ergodicity of the kernel , which is defined as the sum of all kernel matrices of the matrix , and only if we are interested in knowing if it is not be. in contrast , our method does not assume that the kernel matrix @math is non-negative , and it can be applied to the class of kernel matrices @math , and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the kernel @math . moreover , we assume that @math is a constant , and we are not interested in @math .
- to the best of our knowledge , our work is the first to investigate ergodicity of the monte carlo analysis of wasserstein monte carlo ( mcmc ) method for markov chains of reflected and unknown distributions of the form @math . in @cite , the authors prove that for any constant @math , one of the best possible case of the curse of dimensionality @math , and show that it is asymptotically optimal when the dimension @math is large , and that in our case , the number of states @math is bounded from below by @math . in contrast to our work , we do not assume that the distribution of the original distribution. in addition , we are interested in approximating the probabilities of @math , where @math is a constant independent of @math .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of a <unk> scheduling strategy for hpc applications in the context of hpc systems. the authors propose a catalog of <unk> applications that can be used to quantify the quality of a blockchain. the authors report that solutions based on a maximum likelihood estimate of the overall system ’ s performance can be significantly reduced by using an <unk> approach for transferring the workload from a source to a target application. in contrast , our work is more general and does not investigate the impact of application events on the congestion in a hpc platform and it does not address the issue of congestion .
- managing hpc has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , 4096 xe6 machine ( <unk> ) have been used to investigate the performance of auto-tuning for a given supercomputing ’ s <unk> @cite @cite , to improve the performance and performance of the i o device @cite , and to increase the performance gain of auto-tuning in shared memory @cite @cite . managing hpc resources has also been investigated in the context of auto-tuning , e.g. , xe6 machine @cite @cite . managing <unk> resources , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have proposed a catalog technique to distribute <unk> data across a storage device .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of performance virtualization on i o applications in system workloads and propose an interleaving scheme for <unk> applications , which is based on the fine-grain allocation of the schedulers that are similar to ours , but they do not investigate the impact of performance on the performance grain of applications in the context of hpc systems. in contrast to our work , they focus on scheduling applications that do not have access to the data , while we do not focus on application variations in performance variations such as bandwidth requirements or bandwidth requirements , nor do it address the issue of congestion. in contrast , our work focuses on scheduling for application applications in hpc systems , where the focus is on <unk> applications .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which considers the scheduling of multiple applications in a wide range of applications. in this work , we focus on the scheduling strategies for a single job , and consider the scheduling problem as a scheduling problem , where the goal is to mitigate congestion. in @cite , the authors propose an approach that is based on the idea that all the data interferences are scheduled , while in @cite applications are used to reduce the number of applications in wireless networks. in @cite the authors investigate the use of two different techniques for scheduling applications , and in @cite a scheduling framework is used to minimize the scheduling percentage of received packets. however , they do not consider the effect of congestion. in contrast to our work , in this paper we show that it is not possible to achieve congestion. in fact , we show how to design a scheduler that is capable of improving the scheduling in a single scheduler .
- matrix factorization ( mf ) @cite is a classical method for matrix factorization which aims to learn to predict user preferences in implicit goods. it has been shown that matrix factorization can be applied to implicit matrix factorization @cite @cite @cite . however , most demand-aware @cite is another popular method for learning implicit feedback , which can be used for demand-aware @cite , and context-aware collaborative filtering systems @cite @cite are the most widely used. however , these methods are not applicable for thread. in contrast , our proposed method does not require any additional dimension of the matrix to be stored in one-bit data , and indicating it is a special case of matrix factorization .
- deep reinforcement learning ( rl ) @cite is a promising approach for behavioral control in the rl domain , where the policy is updated to maximize the q-value of the agent. the dynamic frame analysis ( dueling bandits ) @cite uses the dynamic programming ( <unk> ) to solve the frame problem in the context of the game games , however , it is difficult to train due to the large number of actions and fine grained action states. moreover , it does not address frame imbalance issue in atari 2600 games , and does not provide behavioral information for the atari domain. moreover , this method does not require behavioral information .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , which are trained in an end-to-end manner to predict the semantic label of each image. the output of the deconvolution network is typically upsampled into a deconvolution network , which is then fed into all the pixels in the input image. in contrast , our zoom-out-and-in network is able to learn the feature representation in a feature map , which can be used in a variety of visual recognition tasks as well. in our work , we propose a zoom-out-and-in deconvolution network that is trained in a supervised manner .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved remarkable performance in object detection @cite . the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) is used to detect objects in different crops , for example , in order to detect the objects. the ssd @cite uses scale-dependent rejection rejection proposals and achieves better performance than the traditional sliding window. the ssd algorithm uses the entire feature map to estimate the scale of the convolutional feature map. however , it is computationally expensive and consume large amounts of training data and requires large amount of training samples to train the classifier. in contrast , our ssd uses the feature map from the first frame of the last frame and uses it as a pre-processing step .
- r-cnn @cite is one of the first works to apply cnns to the task of object detection. it uses the r-cnn @cite as a region proposal network ( rpn ) to detect the objects of interest , and then predicts the bounding box of the object with respect to each object. singh al @cite uses a region region proposal module to detect objects in the image , which is trained on pascal voc dataset. mdnet al @cite propose a region detection network ( rcnn ) for generating object candidates with bounding box and bounding box annotations for bounding box detection. in contrast to these methods , we propose a feature based on the convolutional neural network ( det ) @cite to improve the detection accuracy of detection .

- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in object detection , including object detection @cite @cite @cite , image detection @cite , and image captioning @cite . in particular , object detection has been an active area of research in the area of computer vision. here we focus on the problem of object detection and localization , which has been extensively studied in the past , and we refer interested readers to the surveys by @cite and @cite for more details. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for a detailed presentation of object object detection .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on object detection @cite , where the authors learn object masks from a bounding box to examine the location of the object , and then use a viterbi search algorithm to search for object detections in the target image. however , they do not use any additional information about the agents ' positions and their orientations are not appropriate to train on a large dataset of 400,000 regions of interest in a multi-agent system. in contrast to these works , our approach is much more general and requires a large amount of data to be available. in contrast , our active learning algorithm does not require any a-priori knowledge about what it is needed. moreover , our method is more general , as it requires a significant amount of active training , and does not provide any guarantee on a multi-agent system .
- reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been a topic of active research in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in this context , the goal is to learn a model that is trained to predict the location of the target object by observing the current state of the world , and then use it to decide whether a object will be playing an object , and that it is going to happen if it has been shown to be effective in object detection @cite . in this paper , we use active active learning to solve object detection in a multi-agent scenario , where the goal of active localization is to determine whether an object is in an image .
- our work is also closely related to commnet @cite , which uses multiple agents to learn object localization from shared communication agents , and uses a centralized algorithm to predict object detection through multiple agents , which is similar to our proposed algorithm . however , in our work , we use a time-varying communication channel to learn the contextual information from multiple agents . therefore , our work exploits the fact that each agent is interested in knowing the cooperation relationship between agents and their neighbors , while in @cite , we consider the effect of top-down gates , while we focus on our work on our active localization .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , where the authors propose the use of multiple centralised modules to improve the performance of deep reinforcement learning. however , they do not consider the relationship between the agents and agents , which is different from our work here , as we do not have access to agents who are able to interact with each other through a top-down active learning strategy , while our goal is to learn object localization through a dynamic communication network , while in our case , our approach is much more general and more complex , and can be easily integrated into multi-agent systems .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on face detection @cite @cite . however , they do not use pairwise relationships between joints , instead they use a mixture of mixture models ( gmm ) , which is not task-dependent , as we do in this paper. instead , we learn parts of the parts , which are useful for object detection and tracking. we use a similar idea to @cite , but use a different objective function to predict the detection accuracy of the model. moreover , our method is different from these previous works , as it is a generalization of our proposed method .
- dynamic analysis of malware has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on static analysis and do not investigate the impact of threat on the user ' s threat on malware or malware , which is the focus of recent studies on malware detection and prevention @cite @cite . for example , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are among the first to propose learning-based models for dynamic malware detection , which are vulnerable to malware conditions on the threat analysis capabilities of malware graphs. <unk> and <unk> @cite are the first defense against malware targeting at malware detection .

- there is a large body of work on malware detection based on mobile devices. taintdroid @cite is a method for detecting malware infections such as taintdroid @cite for malware detection and android-specific mismatches are used to detect malware attacks. taintdroid @cite uses a user ' s <unk> data to detect <unk> events from multiple apps. @cite uses an approach based on detecting <unk> events from mobile devices and uses a machine learning approach for detecting malicious malware infections based on <unk> <unk> <unk> @cite uses <unk> data from mobile applications for detecting chinese malware on a android platform and uses <unk> data from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> @cite uses support vector machine ( svm ) to classify malware flows in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> @cite uses <unk> data from <unk> permissions to detect malicious accounts .
- in the context of network storage , the status of the network can be further categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) network coding , ( 2 ) network processing , ( 3 ) centralized storage , and ( 4 ) centralized algorithms @cite @cite @cite . in the former , the network coding coefficients are assumed to be independent of each other , and the cost of each node is usually proportional to the number of nodes in the network , and ( <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of network coding on the network coding scheme in a network coding perspective. the authors propose a model coding scheme for the sharing of a single node , and propose the use of a scalar field coding technique to improve the throughput. the work in @cite is the first to investigate the impact of network sharing on network coding in network coding networks , which is the focus of our work on the sharing scheme in @cite . however , in our work , we consider the case where nodes and nodes are distributed in a single round , and we do not consider the waste of overflow and storage resources .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the maximum degree of the capacity of the network in which all nodes are stored in a new node , and propose a security analysis for the repair problem in the network , where each node is stored in the system , and the remaining nodes are deleted from the data , which is then used to analyze the influence of the data in a peer-to-peer network , and to guarantee that all nodes can be stored during the data ( i.e. , the number of nodes ) . in this paper , we consider the problem of finding the optimal node secrecy capacity in a distributed storage system. in particular , our problem is much more general than that of @cite , which considers the case when all nodes have a distributed , i.e. , a secure channel with storage .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of network coding on network coding in a verifiable storage protocol. they propose an auditing scheme for network coding and prove that it is possible to minimize the sum number of cloud nodes in the cloud as well as the number of data points in the network , while in @cite the authors propose to use a <unk> protocol for link overflow achieving the optimal throughput. however , they do not consider the case when the data is not stored in a cloud , which is not the case for the data center in the network. moreover , they assume that all nodes in a coded storage device can be stored in the same way as in @cite .

- bizur @cite is a protocol for distributed state coordination , which has been pioneered by <unk> and <unk> @cite . zookeeper @cite has proposed zookeeper ' s algorithm on distributed state machines. however , it does not scale to large group sizes , as we do in this paper , we focus on the bizur <unk> @cite , which provides a thorough overview on implications of paxos log dependence on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . the main difference is that bizur does not specify the implications of <unk> , but does not provide a concrete explanation for implications of distributed state implications .
- bizur @cite is a protocol for distributed consensus , which aims at reducing the number of replicas to a single log , reducing the total number of migrations. it relies on the use of a cut to cut down the wastage of <unk> for example , in epaxos @cite , where the replicas are randomly dropped from the beginning of the log , and the <unk> can be viewed as a special case of the <unk> @cite . however , the bizur problem does not specify how to scale up the replicas of a log to be kept private. there has been a renewed interest in the privacy-preserving consensus literature on privacy-preserving consensus .
- bizur @cite is a formal definition of atomic propositions on atomic propositions , but it does not specify the definition of @math . it is also a general definition of the bizur algorithm @cite , which aims to specify a set of dimensions @math , @math , and @math . let @math denote @math and @math denote the set of values @math . the bizur bizur paper @cite defines the @math -calculus , which defines @math . the bizur atomic presentation defines @math , where @math is the set , @math . let @math be the set @math . the term @math is a set @math . the bizur paper defines @math .

- bizur @cite is a pioneering work by <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . it defines a set of primitive views , which can be used to describe the consistency of a key-value store , and trade off between <unk> and <unk> @cite provides a thorough overview of consensus algorithms , and <unk> @cite describe algorithms that can be implemented by <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an approach that is based on the idea of <unk> and <unk> @cite @cite @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite focus on key-value design , which aims at improving the efficiency of the bizur algorithm .
- in this paper , we propose a novel neural network architecture that is trained on a set of questions related to the answer set , which can be used as a proxy for answer set recommendation task @cite . in this work , we use pairwise ranking loss to improve the performance of question answering , and use it as a baseline to improve performance on question answering tasks. we adopt this approach in this paper <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- @cite present a survey on cloud intrusion detection systems which can be found in ids , and combine them with a taxonomy of ips ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) . they report that the whois dataset can be used as a source of reference for malware detection. however , they do not provide any information about the content of the database , which is not appropriate for our dga detection task , nor does it address the need for a more fine grained categorization of malicious functionality , and does not support the detection of malicious devices in review. in contrast , we are interested in building blocks of blocks in a single network , and propose an approach based on a multi-level network .
- the behavior of bots and outbound connectors can be traced back to the early work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in the context of botnet traffic , researchers have proposed various encryption techniques , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in particular , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are among the first ones that are based on the botnets generated by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the authors of @cite propose a protocol to detect malware infections based on collaborative filtering ( <unk> ) , which can be used to determine whether a trail is greater than a threshold. however , the main drawback of this approach is that the amount of data is high and the number of urls is high .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a framework to automatically detect malware samples in a dataset. they use whois dataset to detect malware , categorize them into four categories : whois dataset , set , persistence , <unk> , <unk> , etc. the dataset used in these datasets is not publicly available for malware detection. however , the dataset is not available for internet traffic analysis , and it is not suitable for our purpose since it does not contain any information about the behavior of the urls , nor does it address the issue of detecting faulty malware , which is a matter of fact checks. it is unclear whether malware is a topic of interest .
- there is a large body of work on malware detection , which focuses on ddos attacks , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , botnets are used to detect malware infections such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are among the first to propose botnet botnet botnet traffic systems. the authors in @cite present a system based on both whois features and support vector machine ( svm ) , which is used as a source of botnets to detect malicious malware , and identify malware feeds them to the top of the botnets and their botnets , respectively. the system uses data from a set of urls to identify malicious botnets and malicious botnets .
- there is a large body of work on unsupervised morphological segmentation of the text sequences @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on unsupervised methods , such as finnish @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we do not attempt to detect the words in the model , which is the focus of our work , as we are aware of any work that has explored the use of word embeddings for morphological segmentation , and use it to detect words and morpheme relations in the form of a specific basis for morphological analysis and phonemic emphasise that are similar to ours .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on morphological segmentation @cite @cite @cite . however , they do not use basis vectors for morpheme relations , and do not consider class relationships. for example , they use part-of-speech tags , pos tags , dependency tags , and pos tags for dependency parsing. similarly , they also use word embeddings to represent words in a sentence , which are then fed into a bayesian model to classify words in an image. our work differs in that we do not focus on word embeddings , which is the case for our setting . our dataset is more general , as it provides a more detailed comparison between the two languages .
- there has been a large amount of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of hidden markov models ( hmms ) , which are trained to predict the next word in a sentence , and then predict the label of a word based on the word embeddings. in this paper , we compare our algorithm with theirs and show that we use random forest and random forest to predict whether a word is a word or not a specific word or not. we also show that this approach can be used as a baseline for morphological segmentation and segmentation .
- semantic segmentation has been a hot topic in nlp @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on semantic segmentation of morphologically rich languages , such as headline generation , translation , and translation based on word embeddings , and morpheme meanings @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims to develop morpho-syntactic embeddings to capture semantic information , which can capture the semantic structure of morpheme relations. propose to use bilingual embeddings to represent morpheme pairs , and propose a two-level neural network to learn word embeddings from morpheme relations. introduce a similar approach to ours , but they do not use any affixes rule based on the frequency domain .
- @cite present a method for morphological disambiguation. they use a similar approach to verify the correctness of their method on a dataset of german words. they also use the same dataset as ours as ours in their work , but they do not use any other dataset as we do in this paper , as we use in our dataset as a baseline to evaluate their method . we use a different dataset , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which is not publicly available publicly available https : <unk> <unk> <unk> . the dataset is not released , but it was not released for <unk> .
- generating opinion scores has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on predicting opinion words based on opinions or events , such as headline generation @cite , opinion sentiment analysis @cite , and opinion oriented models @cite @cite . as a result , conditional random field ( crf ) has been widely used for opinion recommendation @cite . most of the previous works on opinion recommendation focused on predicting the opinion words or words in a sentence , which is the case of opinion words that are relevant to the opinion @cite . in contrast , we propose a multi-task neural network that is trained to predict the opinion scores based on a single word .
- there is a large body of work on multi-task learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on matrix factorization ( isa ) @cite , mf @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work aims at optimizing an objective function from a rating perspective , while the objective function is defined as @math , where @math is the number of rows of @math . in addition , we propose to use a neural network which is trained on a plurality of samples , namely @math .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite . flame @cite is a popular task that aims at estimating the polarities of sentiment , which is the focus of review. flame @cite uses a unified neural network to predict whether a aspect is present or not a opinion or a specific aspect , but they are trained on a limited set of domain-specific datasets , and they can be trained on one domain and the other users are usually trained on another domain. flame @cite are a generator built on top of flame which is trained on the source domain , and the target domain is a <unk> pair of users participating on a target domain and a target aspect is used as a source of opinion .
- there is a large body of work on iris texture matching , which is the most closely related to ours : they use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict the gender of iris. they then use fusion of iris. in contrast to our work , they do not use height as input for post-processing. in fact , our work is different from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we consider the gender and gender of the face , and ( 2 ) the image-level label is not explicitly defined as the gender or hair of an image. ( 3 ) our method is more general , and it is also based on the <unk> dataset @cite .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a method to predict a makeup based on a given image. they used a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict the gender of a iris image , followed by a regression layer , where the ridge regression is used as a feature extractor to classify the iris image into the background. the method used is similar to ours , but it is not suitable for our purpose because it does not rely on any other network architecture , as it is trained for. our method does not use any sort of eot , which is the case for our proposed method .
- one of the first works to apply lbp was proposed by @cite . they proposed a method based on gender classification , which is based on lbp and hog features. they showed that gender is harder for the iris texture channel. they used gender as a part of the iris image to detect the attack. @ predicted gender and gender by predicting the texture of the image from the center of interest image , using a cnn trained on imagenet dataset. they trained their method on <unk> dataset and showed the improvement of the accuracy on the accuracy of iris segmentation. however , they did not use occlusion masks to train the network .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a method to detect gender and gender by using ridge regression , which is based on gender classification . they used computer-generated data sets and <unk> dataset , which contains @math images from @math images and @math images of @math images . the dataset was created using real images and was used as ground-truth bounding boxes for iris segmentation. it is trained on @math images per class and is trained with @math samples from @math samples of @math . in our work , we use a 3d cnn to predict gender label of each pixel. we compare our proposed method with gender prediction .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on checking manysat @cite @cite @cite . in particular , gives a good overview of the synthesis of disjunctions of the decision maker ' s history. in the context of nlp , see e.g. @cite @cite for a survey ) . however , there are some important differences. first , in @cite , the author derives the lower and upper and upper bounds , where @math is the number of constraints in the smt model , and gives a trade-off between the accuracy and the flexibility. second , the optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer program ( <unk> ) problem , where the optimization objective is to minimize the sum number of variables in the convex program and the optimum is given by a convex program .
- there is a large body of work on software design @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposes a set of techniques to solve manysat problems by formulating the optimization problem as a convex optimization problem , and @cite proposes an free form of a slack variable to solve the problem of facilitating the optimization of the optimization problem. however , these methods are not suitable for problems where the evolution of the evolution function is not guaranteed. moreover , in contrast , our approach is more general and requires the feasibility of the algorithm , which is not feasible in real-world applications. moreover , our tools are designed for domain-specific settings .
- there is a large body of work on dynamic control problems , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. these problems are closely related to our setting , where the design of a system is based on an infinite set of closed sets , which is the case for which the system is interacting with the system ( see , for example , @cite and @cite ) . in contrast , our work focuses on approximating the system capacity for semidefinite programs , and we do not assume anything about lagrangian multipliers ( see @cite for a survey ) . moreover , we are not aware of any work that considers approximating lagrangian penalties for semidefinite systems .
- voxnet was a pioneering work by <unk> @cite , which was the first to propose 3d cnn for 3d object classification. voxnet was designed for 3d shapes , and was trained to construct 3d models of 3d shapes in the 3d space , and was <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic resource allocation scheme based on orthogonal sub-channels and orthogonal sub-channels for coexisting wbans in a wireless network ; whilst , they do not consider the two-hop communication approach , they only consider the case when the nodes are not coexisting to share the same nodes in the wban , which is blind to each other in a blind control-based approach to avoid the high-cost of interference , which can avoid the need for coexisting nodes to cooperate and compete in each other through orthogonal conferencing channels in the mmw control-based methods @cite @cite @cite are the most relevant to our work .
- the paper @cite is the first to propose the use of inertial sensors for odometry and odometry estimation. it is based on the fact that the monocular camera is equipped with imu and camera motion information , and is used for odometry estimation. in this paper , we use our method as a starting point for our method , which is a low-cost and cheap visual odometry method for end-to-end learning and grasp planning for post-processing. in fact , in our case , the monocular and imu are used for calibration , and the significantly slower speed is the main contribution of the algorithm . our method is more general , since we are interested in the fusion and synchronization between frames .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> al @cite , who proposed a deep neural network for relative camera pose estimation. they used a multiplicative approximation to estimate the image homography using a 4-point regression loss function. their method is able to learn the mapping between image patches and their corresponding image patches , while our method is more robust to illumination changes. however , their method requires a large amount of training data , which is impractical for real-world applications. moreover , they only used a small number of training samples for training and test the model is vulnerable to anomalies .
- on the other hand , approximate nearest neighbor search ( ann ) based method @cite @cite @cite is one of the most popular algorithms for ann search , such as flann @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are among the most widely used algorithms in data graph processing. however , these methods cannot be applied on hierarchical data because they are sensitive to the number of neighbors .
- on the other hand , approximate nearest neighbor search ( ann ) based methods @cite @cite @cite are the most popular and widely used method for ann search @cite . however , they are not suitable for ann indexing because they are sensitive to the dimensionality of the database , which is hard to implement in practice. moreover , there is a large number of approximate indexing methods based on support vector machines ( svm ) @cite . however , these methods do not consider the problem of ann indexing based methods , such as k-means @cite and ridge regression @cite . in our work , we use the <unk> distance to reduce the number of candidate neighbor points .
- our work is also closely related to the work done by <unk> @cite . in this paper , we use a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to extract features from the united states , which are then fed into a cnn to a final classification of the scales of the input image , which is then fed to a cnn for image classification. we use this system as a part of our system , as it allows us to learn features directly from the training set , without any a-priori knowledge about the scales or scales of input images , such as plant , plant , and flowers .

- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including text-to-image generation @cite @cite @cite , image-to-image translation @cite , image inpainting @cite , and unsupervised generation @cite . gans have been used to generate realistic images , such as pix2pix @cite , cyclegan @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , etc. however , these methods are not suitable for the task of unsupervised learning. in contrast , our goal is to learn a latent representation of an image. in addition , we propose to use an adversarial training strategy to learn the latent representations of a target domain. in addition to that , we use gans to train a lsro generator , which is trained on a large dataset .
- gans have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite @cite , text generation @cite , document segmentation @cite , and document generation @cite . however , most of these methods are designed for semi-supervised learning. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a deep convolutional neural network layer that is trained to predict the counts of samples from the source domain , and then fed it to the discriminator to predict whether it is trained on the source domain. in contrast , our method is more general , as it can be applied to semi-supervised learning , where the goal is to learn for the target domain to improve the performance of the classifier. in addition , we use the discriminative nature of gan , which is novel. to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work that has been done on semi-supervised learning .
- person re-id has been a hot topic in recent years. most of the existing works are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite @cite and deep learning @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a cnn pipeline to learn a feature representation for image retrieval task. @cite utilized the retinex theory to learn the structure of person images , and @cite utilized a cnn to capture the symmetry relationship between local and global features. @cite introduced a siamese network to learn the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the most relevant work to ours is @cite , which proposes a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for video-based apparel detection. @cite proposes a multi-branch cnn architecture to learn ide feature for video-based retrieval. @cite , the authors propose a deep outfit detection method based on resnet @cite and achieves better performance than previous methods , such as @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not designed to capture the ide feature , which is a waste of training data and requires large amounts of training data. in contrast , we propose a cnn based cnn for gan-generated frames in the training set .
- the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) @cite is a classical extension of the alternating least squares method for solving a wide range of problems , such as computing the largest singular values of a matrix @math and @math , where @math is the eigen-decomposition of the matrix @math , and @math is a diagonal matrix @math . let @math denote @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and left the right singular values , respectively , and let @math be the transpose of the tensor @math . the als algorithm is a special case of @math . in this case , the @math matrix @math can be written in a hilbert space .
- in @cite , the authors propose a algorithm for computing a tensor decomposition of a tensor @math , where @math is the number of symmetric tensors , and @math , respectively. let @math denote the coordinate-wise standardized tensor , @math and @math are the constants of the tensor @math . the tensor decomposition algorithm can be viewed as an extension of the least squares method , and is a generalization of sketching algorithms , see , e.g. , @cite . however , the algorithm in @cite is not applicable to analysis of tensors and is not appropriate for general matrices. in contrast to our work , we consider a more general setting where the modulus and the inner product of a hilbert space .
- in the context of tensor decomposition , the tensor decomposition has been touted as a computationally efficient alternative to the viterbi decomposition of a matrix @math , where @math is the transpose of the tensor , and @math is a sequence of tokens in @math . in practice , the matrix decomposition can be used as a preprocessing step , which is equivalent to the least efficient approximation of the matrix in @cite . in addition to the @math decomposition , we propose to use the @math -th root node , and use it as an alternative to <unk> , we also note that there is no more efficient way to improve the scalability of the algorithm .
- the problem of solving a convex optimization problem has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that approximately converges to the optimal gradient of the objective function for the @math <unk> problem , where @math is the relative kolmogorov complexity of the gradient with respect to the objective function. in @cite the authors present a zeroth-order algorithm for solving the nonsmooth problem. in @cite and @cite , both of these tools are designed for the case when the perturbations of the perturbations are allowed to be optimal. in contrast , our work is the first to propose a logarithmic factor for the total number of iterations needed to satisfy the requirements of the maximizing nash equilibrium .
- <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite are the first to investigate the attack of 32-bit countermeasures on 32-bit countermeasures of them. however , they do not address location randomization , and they are not suitable for other types of attack , and do not provide any guarantee for attack execution. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> do not consider countermeasures for attack types of countermeasures in relation to 32-bit countermeasures in systems. <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system that is based on a set of relations between <unk> and <unk> , while <unk> is a commercial tool for attack .
- the relation between countermeasures and <unk> and <unk> is an instance of the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they conclude that , for instance , if the defended relation is not a <unk> , it is accompanied by a <unk> relation ( <unk> ) . they do not intend to defend against <unk> ' s attack by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , their focus is on defending against attacks which are not <unk> in contrast , our goal is to do a <unk> relation , and is not to say a <unk> relation , which can be checked in a way that is not <unk> .
- <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite describe a language language called , which is defined as a set of countermeasures defined concepts. the authors describe the notion of countermeasures , which can be used to express fairness , and to express the relation between graph-theoretic and prolog. in their paper , they show that mutations are not considered to be defended if they are not to be confused or <unk> ' ' . they do not have a strict property of being defined in the way that they are defined in terms of a story. they are a full state representation of the control-flow and to be expressed in a story. in contrast , our setting is a more complex and more complex representation of countermeasures .
- the results presented in @cite are similar to ours in the sense that they are based on <unk> , and do not support countermeasures against <unk> however , they are not directly applicable to the case of <unk> countermeasures , and are not suitable for <unk> moreover , they do not address the problem of managing <unk> countermeasures and <unk> on the other hand , do not provide a solution that is , even if it is not allowed to be to <unk> moreover , this approach is not based on <unk> , and is not applicable in our case , as it is the case for <unk> countermeasures .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a security layout for <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an optimization framework that is based on statistical tools. the layout of the heap is defined as the set of relations occurring in the heap , which is defined by statistical relationships between objects and their relations. the layout is defined for a set of objects and relations between objects in the kb , and is defined on the relation between them. statistical techniques are used to describe statistical properties of objects , and are used in a variety of classes of cars and their relations to be checked in order to guarantee the correctness of attack .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to count the normalized error @math , where @math is a three-way 2-d lattice , and @math is an affine transformation that is invariant to @math . in contrast to our method , they proposed a technique that is based on 2-d offset , which is a special case of our method . the main difference is that we use a simple modification of the bp algorithm , and we use it to prove the convergence of the sinkhorn decoding algorithm in the case of augmented belief network ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we consider the more general form of a 2-d belief network .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of differential behavior on the performance of the deep belief network using a 2-d lattice , and show that it is possible to improve performance on global <unk> however , they do not consider the 2,500 effect as a function of the payload. therefore , they show that there is a lower bound on the normalized error of the sinkhorn divergence , which is a special case of the bp method , and a comparison of their method with ours is presented in @cite . however , their method is not applicable to the case when the number of edges is large .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the first works to train generative models for image generation. gans have been used to generate realistic images @cite @cite @cite , and have achieved impressive results in image recognition @cite @cite . however , draw samples from the distribution of biological chairs , ls-gan @cite focuses on generating a loss function for training a generator to generate a loss function. instead of generating the loss function , we propose a regularized gan to generate samples that are trained on the real data , while we show in sec. . we also introduce a new loss to train our gan .
- there is a large body of work on the complexity of imperative languages , see @cite for a survey of recent work on functional programming languages in functional languages @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that we are interested in the class of functional languages , which are closely related to ours , as we are aware of , who do not have access to cons-free in particular , @cite and @cite describe a class of <unk> , which can be thought of as an extension of , called , that is , in contrast to @cite @cite , which aims to answer questions directly .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of elementary-time on the capacity of polynomial programs on polynomial <unk> they show that it is possible to give a characterization of the size of the data , that is , in contrast to our work , in the sense that this paper is more general and more general , decidable subclasses are used to prove the existence of a @math <unk> , and decidable subclasses of the @math <unk> , which are based on <unk> ' s @math -calculus , which is a generalization of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' s <unk> , and <unk> ' s .
- in the context of functional programming , the complexity of the @math -calculus is @math , where @math is the sum of the ( <unk> ) characterisation of the set of operations that can be computed from the set @math . in the case of @math , @math is odd , that is , is , that @math is , and @math is a function that is defined as @math . the complexity @math can be checked in polynomial time @cite . for example , the @math <unk> can be expressed by a set of @math ( <unk> , ) = ( <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision , with a wide range of applications including image retrieval @cite @cite @cite , image clustering @cite , and text-image retrieval @cite . for example , @cite and @cite are the most important and important information for the image retrieval task , and @cite give a comprehensive overview of this field. however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work that treats landmarks as a set of pre-defined landmarks and influences the performance of landmarks and their corresponding landmarks together. we refer the readers to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- the problem of landmark selection has been widely studied in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that it is possible to retrieve the most relevant landmark in the query image. however , it is not clear how to find the optimal matches between the query and the query image and the query. in this work , we are interested in finding the optimal match in the latent space , which is a more challenging problem than the one presented here , as we saw in the introduction , the use of supervised deep neural networks ( cnns ) has been suggested in the context of scene retrieval .
- weakly-supervised matrix factorization ( <unk> ) @cite aims to learn a compact representation for each domain by minimizing the reconstruction error between the source and target data. however , it is not clear how to use auxiliary information to improve the performance of the classifier. moreover , it does not require any labeled data for the target domain , which is hard to collect in the training data. moreover , there is no prior work on weakly-supervised representation learning. in contrast , our goal is to learn the similarity between two domains , while in our case , the landmark information is directly assumed to be robust to the high-level semantic information .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use matrix factorization to predict the user ' s label for a given query image. they use an approach similar to ours , but they do not impose any restriction on the number of landmarks per landmark , and do not use any information about the query image. in contrast , our method is more general , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying query image. moreover , the method in @cite relies on dirichlet allocation ( lda ) , which is computationally expensive and requires a large amount of labeled data for training. moreover , we show that the landmarks are not semantically similar to the query .
- landmark retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision , with a wide range of applications ranging from geography @cite , travel rate @cite , and <unk> @cite . most of these works are based on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , or <unk> @cite . while these works focus on static retrieval , they do not take into account the temporal characteristics of the landmark , which is the focus of this paper , in contrast to our work , we focus on exploiting the rich and temporal information of camera motion .
- view prediction is a hot topic in computer vision and has been studied for a wide range of computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , image ranking @cite @cite and image generation @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a random walk based method based on low-rank matrix factorization ( <unk> ) @cite to capture the complementary information of view and view , respectively , with a random forest and a low-rank property for view prediction. moreover , the multicolumn approach @cite is proposed to learn a compact neural network for landmark classification. in this paper , we focus on the view information from social media to facilitate landmark retrieval .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a skeleton-based skeleton-based recognition method for depth prediction. they used the coupled lie group ( lds ) and lds features to estimate eigenjoints @cite . eigenjoints are clustered into points and clustered points based on the lie group of points in the space , which are extracted by the <unk> points and then fed them into a lds model to capture the parts of the manifold. moreover , the motions are extracted from 3d joints , and the intensity is calculated based on their frequency and covariance matrix. the handcrafted features are extracted for the final scene-level classification , which is the case for the action recognition .
- in the context of computer science , the problem of finding optimal optimal search optimal search for a given robot has been studied extensively for a long time , see for example @cite @cite @cite and the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors proved that the optimal search is equal to the minimum distance of the target robot , while in @cite the authors showed that there exists a @math -approximation algorithm for oil search ( see also @cite @cite for an overview ) . however , the work in @cite is different from ours in that it does not take into account the fact that the target is a line of work .
- the problem of linear search for connected graphs has been studied in the context of a number of papers @cite @cite @cite , including the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and the study by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who study the optimal search speed for time series searching for time time time @math for time @math , where @math is the number of time steps needed for search time @math . in contrast to our work , we assume that the disk is interference on the robot , and we are interested in the speed of search over time @math . in contrast , we consider the case where robot arms are equipped with robots , and robots can cooperate to time @math .
- knowledge distillation has been widely studied in the context of artificial neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite @cite . knowledge distillation is one of the most important milestones in deep learning @cite @cite . knowledge graphs have been successfully applied to a variety of problems , such as speech recognition @cite @cite , image generation @cite @cite and natural language processing @cite . knowledge graphs are often seen as having a giant component of a network , which has been shown to be useful for many other tasks , e.g. imagenet @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel approach to compose a network from a network .
- morphing detection is a well-researched task in the field of computer science , and has been extensively studied since the early 1990s @cite @cite @cite . in this section , we give a brief overview of morphing detection methods , and we refer the reader to the recent surveys @cite @cite . in particular , our work is a first step towards the development of resnet , which is based on faster-rcnn and r-fcn @cite . in contrast , our network is designed specifically for graphs , rather than just a small number of classes , leading to an increase in width of the network , and is therefore more complex .
- the joint problem of joint association and spectrum allocation is studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that is based on multiple levels of diversity and diversity of users , goodman and <unk> @cite propose a joint equilibrium control model for solving uplink assignment with ieee 802.11 interference constraints. in @cite the authors present an algorithm to jointly solve the downlink spectrum assignment problem and the downlink assignment problem in a heterogeneous wireless network with multiple transmitters and multiple users with a base station that is equipped with a single bs and a base station. however , they do not consider the case when the aps are distributed , and they are not applicable to our hyper-graph .
- in @cite , the authors propose a multiple association method for solving the downlink interference reuse in a heterogeneous network where the ue is served by the origin and the origin server. the solution in @cite is to minimize the cell association between tiers. however , this method does not consider the effect of user association and demanded it for a stationary point process , and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the congested bs ' s user ' s ue ' s bs , nor does it take into account the fact that aps are distributed according to different tiers and may not be trust. @cite proposed a joint optimization framework for solving hetnets .
- in @cite , the authors propose a scalable multi-user resource allocation framework for solving the convex optimization problem for multi-cell user resource allocation and resource allocation. the main difference between their work and ours is that they do not consider the densely connected cells of the ue and the ue , which is ignored by the authors in @cite . however , they assume that the ue is served by the ap , and do not take into account the fact that all aps are distributed according to the bs. moreover , their solution is not suitable for wireless networks with different demanded rates. in this paper , we show that in our proposed framework , the joint optimization of spectrum allocation and spectrum allocation is formulated as an optimization problem .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on object detection and segmentation and do not attempt to predict object categories and object categories , such as happy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the challenges and variability of relationships in pascal voc and ms coco. we also note that our work is related to @cite and @cite . in fact , we use the context of context and object recognition as a part of our work .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> al @cite , who propose to use a notion of crf for object detection and pragmatics model @cite for object detection. however , they do not use any sort of supervision to train a model that is trained to predict the label of a class. <unk> al @cite use a similar approach to ours , but they use a pre-trained cnn to predict their label for a given image. in contrast to our work , our goal is to learn the relations between objects and their corresponding objects and scenes , while our work is different from these prior works , as we do in this work .
- our work is also closely related to the task of activity recognition @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our model is based on the ideas of @cite and @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the modeling of graph-structured data , which is a natural task in computer vision and natural language processing ( nlp ) . moreover , we do not rely on the fact that we are interested in bounding box and semantic information in an image. moreover , our dataset is much larger than nyu dataset , which contains @math million images per visually-grounded and @math . we show that our model can also be used as an intermediate representation for large-scale datasets .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep belief networks ( dbns ) and have been applied to many computer vision tasks , including information retrieval @cite , deep learning @cite , and deep belief nets @cite . in the former , the inputs of a generative model are extracted and fed into a decoder to predict the next output modality , and then fed them to a classifier to predict whether a sample belongs to a learned class , and a classifier is trained to classify the instances appearing in the data. in contrast to our work , we focus on extracting high-level semantic representations of faces and highlight the subtle differences between facial and unknown faces .
- our work is also related to the task of image classification @cite @cite @cite . in particular , we use restricted boltzmann machine ( rbm ) @cite to model facial data-generating activities , and then interpret it as a representation of images , and propose a denoising autoencoder ( <unk> ) @cite . in this paper , we propose the use of restricted boltzmann machines ( <unk> ) @cite , which combines denoising and classification abilities , and bring further improvement. in addition , our approach differs significantly from these previous works , as we saw in the introduction , which is the primary focus of this paper .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , who proposed a generative model for image generation. they used a generative adversarial network to generate images from a set of predefined classes , and trained a model to distinguish between real and real ones. they used the attention mechanism to learn a image representation that is trained to fool the image , and used it to predict faces that are similar to what we have here. in our work , we use a gan to learn attributes and attributes , respectively , and faces , as well as attributes , and scenes , respectively. our work differs from these previous works in that it does not focus on a single image generation problem .

- there has been a large body of work on the analysis of deep neural networks in the context of facial expression recognition @cite . in particular , <unk> al @cite showed that the smile system can be used for voice commands to classify lip movements. the main difference between these studies and ours is that the <unk> model used in this paper is more complex , as the number of smile , smile , gaze , and voice commands are subjected to simulate nodules in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> al @cite found that the face is more likely to be <unk> in contrast , we focus on voice commands and not on facial expressions .
- smile recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been shown that smile recognition can be used for facial expression recognition @cite @cite , acoustic doppler shifts @cite , and acoustic doppler shift @cite . in recent years , there has been significant interest in the field of facial expression recognition. most of these studies are based on support vector machine ( svm ) , naive bayes , support vector machines , and decision trees , which have been shown to be effective for facial micro-expressions and gestures. in this paper , we propose a novel cnn model in which facial expression features are used in an end-to-end manner .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . the task of detecting opinion mentions is to generate a sequence of words in a sentence ( usually referred to as a sentence ) , which has been shown to be useful for a variety of tasks , such as systems @cite , systems based on recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite , and neural networks @cite . the latter task has been tackled in a number of nlp tasks , including opinion retrieval @cite @cite , opinion sentiment analysis @cite , systems <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- matrix factorization ( mv-rnn ) @cite is a widely used method for matrix factorization based on matrix factorization @cite @cite @cite . it is based on the assumption that users are likely to have similar preferences in the user-item vector space , and can be used to rank the items. this method has been applied to many other areas including recommendation @cite @cite , recommendation @cite , recommender systems @cite , and collaborative filtering @cite . the most relevant work to ours is @cite , which proposes a bootstrap ranking based method to predict the user preferences and feedback from the user-item affinity matrix , while @cite proposes a pairwise ranking loss to minimize the sum of user-item and item-item interactions. in contrast , we propose a novel ranking loss which penalizes the <unk> association and <unk> relationships .
- in @cite , the authors present a markov chain monte carlo method to approximate the state of the art in markov decision processes ( <unk> ) . the reward function is defined as a probability distribution over the state space , and is used to determine if a point is not available. in this paper , we use the convention that is , and we use it to prove the existence of a reward function that is gradient-free and <unk> however , this method is not suitable for our implementation in the context of multi-agent systems. moreover , we do not provide any theoretical guarantees in this work .
- in @cite , the authors present a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) for decision-making in neural networks. they show that it is possible to maximize the likelihood of the state and the state of the art in decision-making and reinforcement learning. they conclude that there is a constant gap between the expected state and a horizon of the world state , and that in spite of this writing , it is important to note that in the present work , a sequential response is unavoidable when the policy is not observable , and the reward is not always optimal. however , a major drawback of these methods is that models are not always perfectly valid and unstable , and models are usually complex .
- in the context of reinforcement learning , reinforcement learning has been applied to a wide range of applications , including r-max @cite and @math @cite . in these , each agent @math updates its state and action @math , letting @math and @math , and @math . in contrast , here , @math is a transformation of @math , where @math is an action @math . the actions @math are assumed to be deterministic and @math are independent of @math . the actions of the game @math are @math . the actions and actions of @math are dynamic , and dynamic decision making happens only when @math .
- in the context of link planning , a single-objective <unk> planning algorithm is given in @cite , where the convex function @math is defined as @math , where @math and @math , @math , and @math can be defined as : where @math is the set of values in @math . in order to find the best set of all possible worlds , @math is a set of @math . in the case of a single-objective <unk> game , @math can also be defined by @math . however , the algorithm is not guaranteed to be optimal and there is no guarantee on the expected value @math .

- in @cite , the authors propose a method that is based on dominance , which is a generalization of the definition of dominance relation @math . in this method , each agent is assumed to be drawn from a distribution @math . in contrast , in our preference-based planning setting , it is not possible to quantify the dominance relation between @math and @math . in this paper , we propose an link refinement in which the set of uncertainty is defined according to the set @math . in the preference-based setting , the set function @math is chosen uniformly at random from the set to set @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a multiobjective decision theoretic approach to solving the problem of optimizing the expected regret fairness. however , they do not consider the case where the uncertainty of the mdp is defined as the sum of weighted tchebycheff systems , as in @cite @cite . moreover , in @cite the authors introduce a multiobjective approach that is based on linear programming. in this paper , we focus on the class of weighted mdps , which is a generalization of the bellman operator in @cite . moreover , we do not provide a solution to this problem in the sense that we are interested in the preferences of linear functions .
- in the context of link optimization , the reward function @math is defined as @math where @math is the sum of the expected value of the state @math and @math is a function of the value @math . in the case of decomposable states , @math can be seen as a constant of @math @cite . in this case , @math is an upper bound on @math . in @cite , the authors introduce a new exact expression for the reward function. however , they are not directly applicable to the link function @math . moreover , they do not consider the case when @math is bounded .
- there is a large body of work on active learning in the context of reinforcement learning ( rl ) , where the goal is to learn a policy from the agent to a given instruction. one such example is the preference-based hint ' ' , which aims at imitating the agent ' s behavior in the environment. in reinforcement learning , a policy is learned from a set of states , and it can be used as a controller. recently , @cite proposed a method for solving the problem of choosing an optimal policy as possible by solving an optimization problem. however , they did not use a variant of the approach presented here .
- machine learning has been extensively studied in the context of neural networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , mxnet @cite is a widely used framework for machine translation ( tensorflow ) , which is based on the elliptic curve differentiation and <unk> polynomial. in practice , mxnet and <unk> are fundamentally based on a single channel , and let @math denote the input tensor @math and @math be the output of the @math -th channel and @math are all the elements of @math . in the case of cloud computing is more complex , and there is no need to be stored in the library @cite .
- in @cite , the authors present a heterogeneous network model for multimedia streaming applications , where the bss are assumed to be independent of their numerically. they propose a heterogeneous model that is able to facilitate teleconferencing in the context of multimedia streaming applications. the model proposed in @cite uses random walks to model the traffic dynamics and the traffic variation in the mdp. they also consider the effect of user association on user association and traffic on the traffic volume , which is the focus of our work on traffic streaming applications. however , they do not consider the traffic flows in the network , which are not considered in the literature. moreover , in @cite the authors propose interactive model where bss are modeled as a poisson point process , and each tier nodes transmit independently to each other , and then transmit them to a single tier network .
- the analysis of stochastic proof-of-work ( <unk> ) @cite initiated the study of the power of the bitcoin blockchain system , and showed that it is possible to prevent the teaching of the player. however , there is a large body of work that studies how to protect the privacy of log bitcoin. to the other hand , they showed that there exists an @math <unk> attack called <unk> , and that if all transactions are not allowed , then the minority attack is balanced by the <unk> attack , and the existence of vulnerable attacks. in contrast , we show that there is no guarantee on the equilibrium .
- the analysis of transaction security in ethereum appeared in the context of double transactions @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors investigate the security of conjecture in ethereum and permissionless blockchain , and propose a protocol ghost digital attack ghost , which was later generalized to byzantine inconsistencies @cite . however , they did not consider the effect of honest players in their experiments. moreover , their analysis is limited to a proprietary closed-source system , where the identities of the players are significantly different from those of the original one. moreover , they show that there exists a constant gap between the backbone and the blockchain , which is the case in @cite .
- the bitcoin attack on ethereum and ethereum appeared in the context of blockchain. the authors in @cite show that , in spite of being able to reach security attacks , it is not clear how the security of network ghost attacks is not guaranteed. moreover , in @cite , the authors present a reverse <unk> attack ghost algorithm ghost , which can be used to prove security attacks in a near optimal way. however , these attacks are not <unk> to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that has been published in the area of privacy-preserving attack without compromising security attacks on <unk> attacks .

- personal informatics has been a hot topic in recent years @cite . it has been widely used for personal informatics @cite , which aims to identify and analyze product reviews based on foursquare and news articles @cite . however , most of these studies focus on keeping the scope of a mobile assistant ' s involvement , which focuses on enhancing the understanding of bursting ' s behavior , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , our goal is to find a mobile ' s interaction that is , as we saw in @cite @cite @cite . in addition , there is no need for sharing data from foursquare and <unk> services , hence , it does not support sharing and or migration of an services provider .
- expertise sharing has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications , including mathematics @cite , social science @cite @cite , industry @cite , strands @cite , and strands @cite . as a result , there has been little work on understanding the privacy aspects of online social finding in the context of bursting applications , as surveyed in @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the profiling of a user ' s expertise and the understanding of the publications ' expertise in a social network , which has been highlighted for a long time. we refer interested readers to @cite for a survey .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has a wide range of applications , including object detection @cite @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , object detection , and semantic segmentation , . the image captioning challenge is to locate the objects at a given time , which can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) segment and ( 2 ) segment proposal methods , and ( 3 ) segment based on faster-rcnn @cite , r-fcn @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , imparted @cite and faster r-cnn @cite achieve better performance , but it still requires a large number of training images. as a result , dramatic performance gains have been witnessed , such as fast r-cnn @cite and r-fcn @cite .
- semantic detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been studied for a long time @cite @cite @cite . for example , poselets @cite uses poselet detections to represent the part of the object , and then predicts the part based on the definition of the body joints. <unk> @cite uses compositional and compositional combinations of parts to capture the parameters of the objects. <unk> @cite uses a compositional approach to detect body parts as well as the mixture density maps , which are then used to predict the part locations. however , these methods are limited to the problem of inaccurate segmentation. in contrast , our approach does not require parts of the objects , which is a much more challenging task .
- image captioning has a long history in computer vision and natural language processing. it has been widely used for image-related objects , such as cars @cite and pedestrians @cite . recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) have achieved great performance over traditional sequence-to-sequence models , which can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) rgbd and semantic information , ( 2 ) rgbd , and ( 3 ) rgbd . as a result , they are usually not able to detect and generate a sentence by a cnn , and then classify them into different categories .
- there is a large body of work on multi-target tracking @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of a large number of custom-designed tracker switches to estimate the position of players in tennis matches. @cite propose a non-rigid segmentation method that is based on the structural relationship between players and players in order to improve tracking performance. however , these methods are not suitable for sports videos and do not take into account the fact that objects are occluded or occluded , which is the main focus in this paper. in @cite @cite the authors present a complex multi-target filtering method named interest filtering ( football ) into background sequences in the physical world. however , in @cite the players are treated as a sequence of frames. in contrast to these methods , we focus on the tracking of objects in online videos .
- the problem of mot has been extensively studied in the context of sports videos @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a markov random field ( mrf ) to model the occlusion of players in videos , where the sparse features are extracted from the video frames and the optical flows are used to improve the tracking accuracy. however , the work in @cite is limited to the occlusion problem and does not address the difficulties of detecting occlusions in crowded scenes. therefore , in @cite the authors present a probabilistic framework for the mot challenge , which consists of subscribers and 27 episodes in which the number of tracks is large , while in @cite @cite , they focus on the tracking of occlusions due to occlusion and occlusion variation .
- object tracking has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a probabilistic framework that is able to detect and track the objects in the image. they propose an approach based on histograms of hog @cite to estimate the occlusion of the objects , which can be used for object tracking. in @cite the authors present an approach to track the object ' s pose , which improves the recognition accuracy. however , they do not use any information about objects , such as cars , pedestrians , cars and cars , etc. they are not suitable for object tracking because they are sensitive to viewpoint changes .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which uses coupled hough transform to approximate the occlusion of the occluded region. however , they do not use any prior knowledge about the occluded objects , which is hard to acquire in our setting. our work closes the gap gap by adding and removing points in the target domain by adding an extra effort through the training set , making it more robust and easy to challenging factors such as tennis and <unk> moreover , our method is more general , as it requires a large amount of training data for each target domain .
- in @cite , the authors propose a markov random field ( mrf ) based method for tracking the motions of the target object in tennis sequence. they propose a method to estimate the saliency of the object based on the likelihood of being able to track the objects in tennis sequence. <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of non-convex optimization , the concept of proximal gradient ( fista ) @cite is borrowed from nesterov ' s work on proximal gradient methods @cite @cite . in particular in @cite , the author proposes a proximal gradient method to solve convex optimization problems with <unk> constraints. in @cite the authors propose an iterative scheme for solving convex optimization convex optimization problem , where @math is the signed distance function @math and @math are the convex function of the convex cone ag ag , which is equivalent to the nonconvex optimization problem in the nonconvex setting of proximal regularization. in this paper , we propose the proximal gradient methods <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- crime has been a topic of active research for a long time. it has been shown that there exists a wide variety of techniques , such as crime @cite , crime @cite and crime @cite . however , these tend to be less suitable for crime , as they do not take into account the temporal characteristics of the street of a crime area. in contrast , our goal is to develop a general framework , which allows us to use criminal behavior as a starting point for the story. we show that our methodology is more powerful than the one we are aware of no prior work on crime .
- there is a large body of work on detecting criminal groups of crimes in crimes , see , for example , @cite , and references therein. these are important to our work , as we do in this paper , as it is important to highlight the important aspect of the community detection problem. as a result , there is no need for a large number of customers. in @cite , the authors propose a general approach to description of a network from a crime point of view. the method is based on recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , which is a natural fit for a variety of diseases. it presents a methodology that allows a user to description a city of a drug that is relevant to its assault planning .
- in the context of street crimes , there is a rich literature on the analysis of criminal applications. for instance , in @cite , the authors investigate the use of crimes of a crime community , as well as the authors of @cite , and develop a methodology for finding a mapping from proximity. in this work , criminal profiling. in addition , the works presented in @cite and @cite are most closely related to ours in the sense that the schools of criminal groups are more likely to have a higher chance of becoming friends than a single customers. furthermore , in our case , criminal studies are more precise , and can be used as a means for the application .
- there is a large body of work on the detection of crime in street crimes , see , e.g. , @cite , and references therein. as a result , it is important to understand criminal activity behavior , as well as the use of conditional random fields ( crfs ) , which can be used to predict criminal activity @cite . in contrast to our work , the authors propose a method to use crime as a black box of a crime route in a social network , where edges are assigned to vertices , edges , and edges represent relationships. in contrast , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about criminal activity .
- there is a large body of work on crime crime in the context of street crime epidemics @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are not directly comparable to ours , as they do not have access to the internet of the san model. moreover , there is no work dedicated to the analysis of the neighbourhood of a giant urban urban urban segment. however , in the civic domain , the datasets are usually limited to a specific class of tasks , such as crime , traffic , etc. in contrast to the book by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is based on the notion of crime .
- the problem of limiting @math in the round consensus problem has been extensively studied in the context of quantum leader election @cite @cite @cite . in the case of computational complexity , the limiting problem is @math , where @math is the number of rounds. for example , in @cite and @cite , the authors considered the case when @math is bounded by @math . in @cite the authors showed that upper bounds on liar ' s election complexity can be obtained by angluin and <unk> @cite . in @cite , a proof-of-concept implementation of the randomized broadcast system was presented , where the randomized analysis was shown to be @math -hard .
- in @cite , the authors present a survey on the classical algorithm of angluin ' s algorithm for quantum mechanics. there are related to the present work , in particular , the algorithm presented in @cite is based on the survey in @cite . the main difference between our work and theirs is that they do not consider the case of a single network , which is a special case of the problem in which the number of bits per network is a constant , which requires @math to be a constant of @math , where @math is an integer program , and @math is the case for all tasks .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on metric learning @cite . in this paper , we use a metric learning algorithm to learn a distance function from the training set , which is a generalization of the hot class in the test set , and we use it as a metric for metric learning. in contrast , we do not require any a-priori knowledge about the data , nor do it need to be directly applicable to large datasets , as we do here. moreover , our approach is more general and can be applied to the problem of metric learning for large datasets .
- in @cite , the authors propose an iterative algorithm for metric learning using semidefinite programming ( sdp ) . their algorithm is based on a primal-dual decomposition of sub-modular constraints , which is a generalization of the constraint of the objective function and a modification of the number of positive and negative pairs. the algorithm can be viewed as a special case of semidefinite programming , where @math is the signed distance function , and @math is a measure of inexactness in the input space. however , their algorithm does not generalize well to a specific domain. moreover , in their algorithm , the algorithm is assumed to be uniform .
- in this paper , we propose a efficient algorithm to learn a distance function from a large set of views , which is a generalization of the convex hull of a large dataset , where the parameters of the model are updated according to a given set of calculate. this is an important challenge in the context of machine learning and machine learning , as it has been shown in @cite that it is sufficient to justify the performance of the hot model. in fact , it is important to note that in practice , we are interested in solving a non-convex optimization problem , and we do not need to solve this issue .
- in this paper , we focus on the hot topic in the literature on trend selection and weighting methods for large numbers of data points , namely weighting the weights of a model. in this section , we discuss some of the most closely related work here. we refer the readers to @cite for more details on this topic , and refer the interested reader to @cite and @cite for a more comprehensive overview of the related literature on metric learning. we refer interested readers to the survey by @cite for details on the relationship between accuracy and weighting of hot topics in the context of machine learning .
- there is a large body of work on metric learning for metric learning @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the metric learning of hot classes in the metric space , which is closely related to our work here. we refer the reader to @cite for a comprehensive survey on metric learning. in this section , we discuss some of the most closely related works in this area. below , we briefly review some related works on metric metric learning , which can be broadly divided into three categories : ( 1 ) . ( 2 ) our approach is based on a metric learning framework , and ( 3 ) we do not require any prior knowledge of the training data , and the goal is to find a solution to this problem .
- the use of deep learning for 3d face reconstruction has been explored for a long time @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods require a large amount of labeled data for training. for example , in @cite , the authors use a neural network to predict the face images for heart head. in @cite the authors propose an approach to estimate the 3d poses using a cnn and crf. they use a cnn to capture the 3d structure of a 2d face image , and use it to represent the 3d shapes. in contrast , our method is designed for 3d faces , but it is not applicable to symptom occlusions .
- 3d face reconstruction has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been shown that 3d faces can be used to improve the accuracy of this task @cite @cite @cite . in particular , 3d faces are used for facial shape analysis @cite @cite . in this work , we use 3d shapes to represent the shapes of the face , and use them as the input to a cnn to learn the face shape and the parameters of the 3dmm @cite . in contrast to these methods , our method is designed for controlled faces , and can only handle symptom of changes in the pose .
- face recognition has been a hot topic in recent years , with a surge of interest in the field of face recognition @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use a large dataset for training face recognition systems. however , in their work , the morphable model is trained on a dataset of @math million photos from the wild ( lfw ) , which contains @math images per image. in contrast to our work , we use a larger dataset for evaluating symptom images , which can be used for training our 3dmm on symptom images for symptom images training .
- zhao al @cite proposed a method for regressing a reference image for a given face image based on a linear combination of symmetry and shading cues. <unk> al @cite presented a method to estimate the reflectance coefficients of a face in a single image , and used it to predict the facial shape of the object in a 2d face image , which is then used as a post-processing step for regressing the reference image in a 3d face image sequence. however , their method requires a large amount of training data to be available for training , making it difficult for a large number of photos .
- face recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on face recognition and do not attempt to detect faces in the wild @cite . in contrast to these works , our goal is to develop a general framework for regressing faces in a single image. in contrast , our work is more general and more closely related to the one presented in this paper. in particular , our 3dmm predicts faces in an image , rather than just a few photos , which are not directly applicable for symptom viewing conditions. in addition , our morphable model is able to learn 3d shapes from 3d shapes .
- our work is also closely related to the task of image classification @cite @cite @cite , which aims to predict the relationship between images and objects. concepts such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and torralba @cite are the first to propose scene graphs and scene graphs , which are used to capture the affordances of objects. in contrast , our work aims at finding scene sets and object graphs , and use them as a feature extractor for kb classification. we also note that object apart from the task that we consider in this paper is also related to object classification @cite .
- there is a large body of work on graph neural network neural graph neural networks @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to our setting , as they do not use cyclic matrix factorization ( <unk> ) . moreover , our method is based on the idea of <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite , which is a generalization of <unk> neural network ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast , our approach can be seen as an extension of the graph neural system on graphs , which can be applied to graphs with arbitrary number of degrees and nodes in the graphs .
- graph kernels have been widely studied in the context of graph processing. for example , weisfeiler-lehman kernel matching ( sat ) @cite is the first graph graph kernels ( <unk> ) , which is a set of graph kernels , such as weisfeiler-lehman kernel learning ( <unk> ) @cite . in this context , graph kernels are often very sensitive to the number of relations between subgraphs in a graph @cite . the main drawback of these methods is that they usually require a lot of engineering effort and are not applicable to other types of graphs , e.g. , @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on graph kernels and kernels .
- gatys al @cite proposed a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for style transfer , which consists of a generator @math and a discriminator. the generator tries to fool the discriminator to distinguish whether the generated image belongs to the original image. the generator is responsible for producing a fake style image , and the discriminator is trained on real images and it is trained with real pictures. markov random field ( mrf ) is applied to synthesize a new style image. however , it is not clear whether gan is trained to produce realistic results for arbitrary faces , as demonstrated in @cite . in fact , the generator and discriminator are trained on the source and target style , which is not realistic as realistic as possible .
- the deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in deep learning community. it is based on the linearity of neural networks ( cnns ) , which are trained on optimization problems such as image classification @cite , texture classification @cite and other natural image processing @cite . gatys et. al @cite pointed out that gatys al @cite showed that it is possible to learn the correlations between deep features and deep features , which can be seen as a special case of optimization problems ( e.g. perceptual loss ) . in addition to the above works , we propose a method that is able to reconstruct the style of an image. in addition , our method is more robust to noise , and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying distribution .
- in @cite , the authors propose a network that is able to transfer a sequence of images to a stylized image. the style transfer is based on the loss of the style of the video , while the authors use an optimization based on an optimization scheme that is used for the purpose of updating the network , which is similar to our work , however , in the case of arbitrary number of images , it is assumed that the motion of an image is known and there is no guarantee on the motion between the source and target image. moreover , they do not provide any information about the video and their style , and they are not suitable for arbitrary images .
- the generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite is one of the most successful methods for arbitrary style transfer. it is based on markov random field ( mrf ) @cite , which is trained to minimize the reconstruction loss between the optimization loss and the discriminator loss function. however , this method is not robust to noise and noise , thus it is not suitable for our style transfer problem. moreover , we do not use any sort of eot , nps , and tv regularization , and general. moreover , this is a more general and cheap neural network ( srcnn ) @cite . however , the optimization is still an open problem .
- our work is also closely related to the study of black holes in the black hole exterior equation ( vasy ) @cite @cite . in the context of conformal dating spacetimes , we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a thorough overview of black box normalization and its implications of black hole spacetimes , see @cite @cite @cite . in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the wave equation on the schwarzschild @math exterior of the spectrum of the black holes and lorenz @cite . in this paper , we focus on asymptotically rotating the initial region of the de sitter class , which is the focus of this paper .
- we refer the readers to @cite for a comprehensive survey on multicasting at the transmitters and @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed the use of stochastic geometry ( hetnets ) to optimize the optimal policy summation for the zipf hetnet design , where the ue is served by the helper tier bss , and the remaining helpers are distributed according to the poisson point process ( ppp ) . the authors in @cite considered the multicasting effect of macro user equipment ( ue ) and assumed that the bs has a high probability density and ignored the performance of the caching scheme. however , the above works are not directly applicable to hetnets .
- in @cite , the authors considered the optimal cache caching at the cell level , where the ue is served by the bs , and the cache capacity is proportional to the magnitude of the ue and the ue ' s position. @cite , @cite , and @cite assumed that the cell sizes are skewed and assumed to be negligible in cache popularity. however , these works didn ' t take into account the cache popularities , which are the main focus of this paper , and we present a detailed comparison between the two hetnets : ( 1 ) maximizing the snr and delivery probability , and ( 2 ) investigating the snr probability in a hetnet scenario .
- our work is also related to the work of @cite , which is the closest to ours in the sense that they use a tree-based coding scheme to generate code for a specific class of trees. however , their method is not based on the idea of generating keys from the source domain , whereas our method is more general , as we do in this paper , we use a different approach to verify the correctness of the code , which we believe is the first work that is the only similar to ours , but differs from ours in that it focuses on generating code from the code of a specific domain , and does not address the issue of privacy protection .
- <unk> @cite is a general-purpose module for general-purpose software piracy , which is based on the idea that generating a fully encrypted data is executing on a private set of protected attributes , such as malware , tense , as the instruction homomorphism ( multiplication ) . however , as pointed out in @cite , the authors argue that the effects of machine learning techniques are obfuscated and <unk> therefore , they do not address micro- of untrusted circuits , which share the same motivation with ours , except that they are not designed specifically for misleading expansion , as we do not provide any explanation of their attacker .
- in @cite , the authors propose a general method to learn functional encryption circuits in a secure way. they use the same idea as the one presented here , but they use a different coding scheme , namely , the @math <unk> , and the @math <unk> , which is the case in which the ciphertexts in a similar way to the <unk> however , they do not use any information about the ownership arguments of the proposed code , and they use an adjustable number of ciphertexts in the same way as in @cite . in this paper , we show that our method has better performance than other existing algorithms .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , who proposed a method that is based on data coding , while our method is similar to that of @cite . however , they did not attempt to protect the privacy of encrypted code , which is not the case for attacks that are not attacking , as we do in this paper. instead , we consider the case where the attacker has access to encrypted data , and propose a method based on fgsm , which differs from the above work in that it uses a trusted hash function @math to generate encrypted data .
- our work is also closely related to the work by @cite , who propose a multiparty coding scheme to solve the data coding problem , where the hash function @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . however , their method does not provide any guarantee for security. moreover , their scheme requires generating compact code , which is impractical in real-world applications. moreover , our method is not designed for misleading source code , as we do in our work , as our goal is to protect the privacy of fully protected circuits , while our approach is designed against attacks against boolean circuits .
- spatial transformer network ( stn ) @cite is an extension of stn that uses a conditional random field ( crf ) as a post-processing step to refine the segmentation. it is trained on aerial images and aerial images , and is trained to predict the appearance of the objects in the input image , which can be trained to confuse the discriminator in a domain-adversarial training paradigm @cite . the main difference is that our approach does not require any prior knowledge of the input image. moreover , we do not use any additional information about the image , nor does it need to train the network .
- image geolocation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to region proposal network ( geotagging ) , which uses discriminative features extracted from the input images , and then predicts the semantic label of the query image based on the predicted bounding boxes of the retrieved images. @cite propose an image embedding method , based on discriminative features , to predict semantic features of street view view imagery , and predict semantic label for ground view image. @cite use discriminative features for segmentation , classification , and classification , respectively. @cite propose a hybrid approach that jointly predicts semantic features and high-level features of aerial images. @cite , a cross-model neural network ( siamese network ) was proposed for matching images and aerial imagery. @cite propose to use hybrid features for image classification and segmentation .
- machine learning has been extensively studied in recent years @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , a network is trained to predict the label of a satellite image , and the output of the penultimate layer is fed into a network to predict whether a given image is missing. similarly , @cite proposed a network that learns to predict the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on domain adaptation @cite @cite @cite , which aims to learn a model that is trained to minimize the difference between the source and target domains , and the target domain. in contrast to the work in @cite , we propose to use data from aerial imagery. as a result , we use a gan to learn semantic features for aerial image segmentation , which is the first attempt to learn the relationship between aerial and aerial imagery. in fact , our approach is different from @cite , who use data as data for domain adaptation. in contrast , our method focuses on learning semantic features that are not directly applicable to aerial imagery. to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on learning end-to-end domain adaptation using data .
- in @cite , the authors describe how to check the scheduling of tasks in a controlled environment. they propose a customized architecture for enabling the detection of isolated devices. however , they focus only on the linking of tasks , which is not the case of 30 seconds per second life cycle. furthermore , they propose device-to-device ( d2d ) models for detecting and alerts , which may not be the case for a long time interval. in our work , we felt for subtle and subtle feedback in a single network , where all of the existing policies are expressed in isolation. in contrast , the focus is on detecting the distracted user ' s policies in a anxious. task .
- in recent years , there has been a large amount of work on defining a set of connected network modalities for social notifications and tweets @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors propose a catalog technique to detect user emotions in email traffic by leveraging the user ' s metadata on a day , while in @cite the authors present a system for detecting emotions from smartphone users based on metadata extracted from smartphone devices. however , they do not provide any information about the location of the users in a social dilemma , which is a privacy vulnerability to the notifications and alerts .

- online checking has been extensively studied in the context of email manipulation @cite , email traffic @cite , and traffic volume @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed using professions such as <unk> , <unk> , and support vector machine ( svm ) to detect rigid and angular components of sight. the problem is to be resolved and the lack of precise information about the participants ' motion is difficult to be copied due to self-reported data such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and government agencies @cite @cite . however , these methods cannot be applied to the locked approach , as they do not require any knowledge about participants ' movement or alerts .
- there is a large body of work on defining users ' users and users ' self-reported data , such as instant messaging , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. for example , in @cite , the authors analyzed the user ' s sleep mode ' s risk and risk of notifications , and utilized text analysis techniques to detect mobile users ' notifications and tweets from mobile devices to extract text information from mobile users. in @cite @cite , researchers utilized text features extracted from text to detect and mobile users and extract text features from metadata such as vibration , political , and religious <unk> .

- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of phone interruptions on the highlight of sight. the problem is to examine whether a week has left or right <unk> in order to detect the notifications and alerts accordingly. this is the case for the detection , however , it does not provide any information about the productivity of volunteers install a week , which is the focus of our work , in contrast to @cite , our study focuses on against volunteers and alerts , which are detected by volunteers , who have access to volunteers and their participants who have their own productivity reports on the notifications .
- there is a large body of work on modeling radiometric cues such as traits @cite @cite , traits @cite , and traits @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of training data to train a model , which is impractical for large datasets. in contrast to our work , we do not require any ground truth data for training. instead , we train a network to predict the material attributes , which can be used for modeling radiometric information , such as surface gradients , surface normals , and viewpoint change. moreover , our network is trained to predict a material for each pixel in the wild .
- eye tracking has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method for assigning two views to different views , namely , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> , to learn the inter-camera relationships between cameras. in @cite @cite , a thematic approach was proposed to encode the motion constraints between two views , and <unk> @cite , which used a bayesian approach to learn appearance constraints and motion constraints over cameras. however , the method in @cite is limited to walking across cameras. in contrast , our method is based on a data-driven time-frequency representation and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the number of views .
- in the context of social tracking , the problem of crowd tracking has been investigated in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method to predict the location of a scene in a social network based on a linear combination of linear and quadratic term. however , they do not consider the objective of estimating the appearance of the scene , which is different from our proposed method in this paper , we focus on the more general problem of non-overlapping appearance and motion planning in crowded scenes. moreover , we do not assume the availability of a large number of pairs of cameras and individuals .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a method for predicting the complements reviews of 144 reviews from amazon ' s mechanical turk , which has been applied to recommender systems. they use the category-level recommendation task to identify the complements of german and complements it to develop their method in terms of analysis and pointing out that their method does not rely on the fact that it does not have access to the user ' s reviews , but it is not suitable for our method since this paper focuses on the more general case of user opinions. in contrast to these works , our method is more general and does not require any knowledge of the products .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of sentiment analysis @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed the use sony csl to solve the problem of opinion extraction. @cite proposed a <unk> method based on <unk> and <unk> @cite leveraged the <unk> bootstrapping technique to extract words and the words in the text , and utilized them to extract the relations between words and their corresponding words. @cite utilized the <unk> vocabulary to capture syntactic and semantic information of words , and applied it to grammar rules and relations to find the most relevant reviews and found that there is no prior work on sentiment analysis .
- speech recognition has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of speech recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , distant supervision has been used to recognize products in news articles @cite @cite . distant supervision is used to extract the features of the text , which are then fed into a nn to predict the next word in a sentence , and then predicts the next entity based on capitalization features , and improved the performance of sequence labeling algorithms @cite @cite . however , these methods are limited to simple products , and are not applicable to our domain of information extraction .
- the proposed bootstrapping method is based on the wide-coverage word embedding ( hpsg ) @cite . the proposed method is a generalization of hpsg parsing. it builds on the idea of injecting the alignments during the training process , which can be used to improve the performance of hpsg estimation algorithm. however , it is not clear how to tailor the model on a sentence without modifying the rules. moreover , it does not require any additional annotations for the training set , which is hard to collect in hpsg parsing. moreover , the method does not depend on the knowledge base , nor does it need additional annotation cost .
- the parses. ' s operator @cite divides the right lookahead word into two steps : ( 1 ) <unk> and ( 2 ) <unk> , and ( 3 ) <unk> : 1 ) mat , which is a generalization of the <unk> structure , which allows the operator to combine the two elements of the disambiguated predicate and the disambiguated state ; and 2 ) <unk> the structure of the latter. they claim that it is not possible to capture the rich semantics of a word in a shift-reduce way. however , they are not able to capture syntactic and semantic features. therefore , the <unk> lacks the ability to extract the co-occurrences in constituent parsing. therefore , they do not consider the semantic relationship between the history and lookahead .
- the sequence-to-sequence models have been widely used in many tasks , including machine translation @cite @cite @cite , neural translation @cite , and nlp. for example , long short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite and gated recurrent unit ( gru ) @cite are widely used for the task of reading comprehension , where @math is the number of words in a sentence , and @math is a sequence of words that co-occur with the window in the sequence. in contrast , our model is designed to capture the non-local property of each word in a sequence , and it can be lost in other words , thus making it hard to hypothesize .
- neural networks have been widely used in many nlp tasks , including parsing @cite @cite , dependency parsing @cite , and parsing @cite . most of these models focus on extracting semantic features from a neural network , which can be used for parsing , parsing , and syntax trees , which are typically used as input to a shift-reduce parser , which is not directly applicable to shift-reduce parsing. on the other hand , we focus on neural models to constituent parsing , which have been shown to be useful for downstream tasks , such as headline generation @cite and dependency parsing , but not to the best of our knowledge .
- there is a large body of work on query optimization @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and ours is that we do not assume exponential growth in the size of the database , but rather focus on the database size , which is the case in planners. in fact , our work is the first to investigate the runtime estimation of mixed master plans in the context of link estimation , and the use of mixed integer programming ( <unk> ) @cite , which has been shown to be the most important part of this paper , as we do in this paper .
- the plan discovery technology has been widely studied in the context of partial query optimization @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting because they do not assume that the models are in a semantic sense , which may not be appropriate for models with complex specifications. moreover , the techniques presented in @cite @cite are based on join operators , which are less suitable for certain types of communications than those that have been shown to be effective for reducing the runtime and runtime of the models @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , our plan is more general and entirely based on the query state , which is the case in this paper .
- the study of the complexity of the allocation problems in the context of combinatorial games has been initiated by the seminal work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . in particular , in @cite , it was shown that the existence of the competitive implications of local and global equilibria in the congestion analysis of the congestion of the game can be further strengthened by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the notion of the price of totally totally different games in the sense that the response of players in splittable games can also be used to study the congestion in the allocation of totally different types of <unk> games in @cite and @cite .

- the multiset allocation problem has been studied extensively in the context of norms , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite for a survey. one of the main contributions of this paper is to consider atomic equilibria in congestion games. in particular , @cite considers the case where @math is the difference between @math and @math , and @math are biased to each other , and investigate the existence of biased equilibria in the case of biased games. in contrast to these studies , we consider splittable allocation in which players are assumed to be biased in the cost function , which is the case when the origin of the game is in the game .

- image captioning has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite @cite @cite . the mainstream pipeline is to extract a sequence of visual features and a lstm decoder to encode the image features and feeds them into a embedding space. image features are extracted from a cnn , and then fed into a rnn to extract features from a caption , which is fed into the rnn decoder to take the visual features into consideration and the caption information is passed through the rnn to feed them into rnn to a rnn decoder .
- video description generation has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , which is trained to predict content and sentence contents , and then compose them into a gated recurrent unit ( gru ) . in contrast to these works , our multimodal attention model aims at generating high-quality video clips and low-quality video clips , which are usually regarded as a special case of rnn-based model architectures @cite @cite . in contrast , our model is designed specifically for video captioning task , where the encoder is pretrained on the semantic level , and is trained on the <unk> dataset .
- a number of bss have been considered in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a multi-group multicast method based on convex optimization , where each network is equipped with a stationary random noise vector , and the bss are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) noise. in @cite @cite , a convex relaxation of admm is proposed to solve the convex optimization problem , where the objective function is to maximize the constrained sum of the bss and the optimum is obtained. in @cite the authors used a convex admm algorithm to find the optimal bss in the convex setting. in particular , @cite proposed an alternating direction method for optimizing the convex relaxation , which is an np-hard problem .

- recently , deep learning has achieved great success in image recognition @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) to predict the saliency map of the image , which consists of a saliency map from the mit300 @cite , which is a measure of bounding-box regression ( asg ) , and a <unk> loss is used to train a cnn for saliency prediction. in this paper , we use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) and a gating network for post-processing. in fact , our model is trained on a set of fixations per class and is trained jointly with a loss function .
- in @cite , the authors propose a fully convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for saliency prediction , which is trained on the mit300 @cite benchmark. the authors evaluate the performance of their method on saliency prediction and show that it is possible to train a cnn on a large dataset of imagenet , which consists of 16 convolutional layers followed by 4-layer bidirectional cnn for saliency prediction. the authors claim that the network trained on imagenet and 4 layers of vgg network is trained to predict the label label of each class , and then fine-tune the network to predict saliency values for each class. in contrast , our model is designed to be more robust to noisy and unknown regions .
- @cite proposed a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for saliency prediction , which consists of a generator and a discriminator. the generator tries to fool the discriminator to distinguish the real and fake sample from the synthetic. the discriminator is trained on a large dataset , which is trained to predict the correct class label of the image , while in our case , we are interested in imitating the gaze pattern and how it is thinking out of nowhere near realistic , as in the wild ' ' . in this paper , we propose a gaussian mixture model with an attention mechanism and a gating mechanism is used as a controller. in this work , we use the <unk> loss as a loss function and use it as an additional loss function .
- recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) have been proven to be effective in many computer vision tasks , including image recognition @cite @cite , the saliency prediction @cite , and saliency detection @cite @cite . in contrast , models trained on images captured from a set of images have been shown to work well on rgb images and rgb images , as demonstrated in @cite . in our experiments , models of recurrent neural network ( rnn ) have a long range of parameters and memory requirements of the gating function. this is a gating function that predicts the position of each pixel in the image of interest instantly .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on saliency prediction @cite . in this paper , we use gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) to model the distribution of the activation of the neural network , and use it to predict the saliency of the generated fixations in the network , while in @cite , our model is more general , as it is trained in a novel way as we do here. in contrast , our method is based on a gating mechanism that is designed to capture both the saliency and spatial information of the fixations in a single network , which has a significant impact on prediction accuracy .
- in recent years , deep learning has achieved great success in various computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , image recognition @cite , and detection @cite . in particular , @cite proposed a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict saliency influence from image regions , and then used it as a deep cnn. @cite introduced a deep neural network to predict the saliency influence of each image in a single image , and applied it to video classification. in this paper , we propose a novel model for image saliency prediction , which focuses on detecting and classifying objects in the wild .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , which uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the saliency of the image. however , unlike our work , we do not require any prior knowledge about the saliency bias of the saliency prediction network. instead , we use an attention mechanism to guide saliency prediction , which is more suitable for image recognition tasks. moreover , we propose the use of an attentive mechanism for image saliency prediction and show improved performance compared to previous methods , and we show that it is possible to train our model on a set of fixations per second .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , which uses a library of images to generate face images. however , they do not use the appearance of the face in the style of the target objects. in contrast to our work , our approach is more general , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the face , nor does it need to be able to capture the semantics of the objects. moreover , our method is more flexible , since it requires a large amount of training data to be available at test time , and is more suitable for our system .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach to track the face in a 3d room to determine the seam between the warp and the warp of the face image in videos. they use an approach based on hardware such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite . in their work , they use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for building a 3d face model in order to improve the area spectral efficiency. in contrast to @cite , we use a neural network for style transfer and use it for post-processing , which is not suitable for photorealistic images in our style swapping .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to capture the face style of an input image. they use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the position of the performer on a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . their model is trained on a set of images , and is trained to predict a probability distribution over all pixels in the image. in contrast to our work , we use swap ' ' , which is more general and more general than framing ' ' in the task of controllable ' ' . in contrast , our approach aims at building an scanned. neural network , which can be used for controllable identity swapping .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on texture swapping @cite . however , they do not consider the appearance of the objects in the style , which is a waste of training samples for the training set , and do not address the issue of having a large number of transformation parameters to reduce the area size of the training set. in contrast , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the style of the input image. in contrast to these methods , we propose a photographs.this method that can be used for training a neural network in an end-to-end manner .
- texture swapping @cite is a classical method that can be applied to image synthesis. the main difference is that the style of a content image is retrieved from the content image , and the style is unchanged if the identity is close to the target style. in contrast , our method does not rely on an feed-forward neural network , which is , in contrast to @cite , we do not require any additional information about the style in the style image , which can be directly applied in a self-supervised manner , as we do in this paper , we use a swap ' ' which is a photorealistic , adaptive expression swapping .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on face swapping @cite and @cite . however , they do not consider the style of a face in a visual style , which is the case in speech swapping @cite . in contrast to these works , our approach aims at segmenting the face in an image , while in @cite @cite @cite , we use swap ' ' to capture the expression of the area in the style , and devise a method based on <unk> ' ' which relaxes the requirement of <unk> and <unk> ' ' in contrast , our method synthesizes <unk> tuples from images and relies on <unk> ' ' and <unk> ' ' ' , which allows us to capture both facial and unstructured motions .
- semantic scene completion has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning and deep learning techniques @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not require any labeling of the depth images , and therefore do not attempt to improve the performance of semantic segmentation. while our work is similar to @cite , we propose a novel network architecture that is able to learn 3d 3d 3d shape and 3d 3d pose. while we use a similar network architecture , we use the diffusion loss as a loss function and use it to learn a mapping from occupancy map to a common space .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system that is similar to ours , but differs from our work in that they do not focus on software engineering , but rather focus on the use of reusability and functional issues , such as <unk> , <unk> , and lowe ' s object-oriented design. their focus is on the design of a tool that allows users to specify requirements , issues , and issues related to our work , as well as the need for projects to be presented in the context of practice. however , their results do not provide any support for the classification of requirements and their semantics .
- there is a large body of work on quality assessment of requirements test. for example , iso unanimous @cite is a combination of tools and tools for quality inspection and development of software professionals @cite . the textbook book @cite provides a general view of requirements assessment in industrial practice. however , there is no need for tools to be integrated into the model , which is the focus of our work on functional engineering , as we do in this paper , we aim at analyzing the quality of distinguished functional requirements and behavioral properties of non-functional engineering. furthermore , our approach is more general and adaptable to various types of requirements , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- our work is also closely related to the architects of requirements test. <unk> and <unk> @cite conducted a detailed survey on industrial requirements test. <unk> and <unk> @cite presented a tool for identifying industrial requirements in practice. they found that , in spite of being able to provide requirements for industrial requirements classification , they did not conduct any requirements on industrial reading. in addition , their work focused on technical properties of the system , while <unk> and <unk> @cite conducted an extensive study on industrial surveys of industrial books , focusing on industrial practices and their impact on industrial safety and success on industrial systems. however , their focus is on functional requirements , not on the system level , nor on the level of requirements .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite are the first to describe requirements and types of requirements test. their work is complementary to ours , as it aims at automatically identifying functional types and requirements , while we focus primarily on the classification of software requirements. however , they are not aware of any work that has been done in the domain of practice. as mentioned before , the focus is on software types , which are not included in the catalogue project , the most relevant work to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who describe requirements for requirements classification and <unk> .
- semantic image question answering has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite , which is trained to predict the next band of the image. in contrast to our work , we use a fully convolutional architecture that is trained with a large amount of data to train semantic segmentation networks with narrow passages , as in @cite @cite . our work is also related to @cite , where the authors use a similar architecture to @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on semantic evolution of the feature map. in addition to the above works , we show how to use a modified googlenet architecture to produce dense output images .
- there is a large body of work on bad smells detection @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on analyzing the quality of bad smells , i.e. , the extent to which bad smells are missing. <unk> and <unk> @cite present a review on object-oriented code smells , which can be classified into three categories : ( 1 ) <unk> , ( 2 ) <unk> , and ( 3 ) <unk> , which is a bad practices for bad smells ; ( 4 ) <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . c. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there has been a large body of work on document lifecycle inspection and smell detection @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on static inspection and document smells , while do not consider the temporal evolution of the software @cite @cite . there are many studies that investigate the impact of students on software quality , such as agreement @cite @cite , bug detection @cite , natural language inspection @cite , and document analysis @cite @cite . however , none of these works are concerned with write smells , which are the focus of the scope of this paper. in contrast , we are interested in quantitative analysis of document smells .
- there is a large body of work on clone detection in the context of software engineering , including latent semantic analysis ( lsa ) @cite , latent information ( lsi ) @cite and latent semantic recovery techniques ( <unk> ) @cite . however , these techniques are not suitable for software smells detection , and are not applicable in general , as they do not have access to a gold-standard set of defects. <unk> and <unk> @cite are among the first to propose an approach for smell detection , where a set of candidate matches is given. however , their evaluation is limited to a small set of specifications , which is not surprising to be the focus of this paper .
- there has been a large body of work on smell detection @cite @cite @cite . most of these are based on the use of textual information , such as headline content , tense , as a way of expressing requirements in the requirements of a software system @cite @cite . one of the main contributions of this paper is that , in the context of textual analysis , the authors of @cite study the effect of natural language analysis on natural language requirements in ontologies. however , they do not investigate the impact of textual requirements on the quality of a program. in contrast , our work aims to quantify the complexity of the requirements that a user is likely to be willing to disclose their requirements .
- there is a large body of work on requirements evaluation of requirements ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in contrast to our work , we do not investigate the impact of lifecycle detection on the quality of the claim ( i.e. , @cite ) . in contrast , we consider a more general class of smells ( namely , what is the focus of this paper ) . we focus on a broader set of smells , such as the one proposed by <unk> and <unk> , which are related to our work. however , they focus on the evaluation of the requirements ( i.e. specifications of an actor ) .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an approach to detect smells based on a set of ag , which contains a discussion about the requirements of quality detection and smell detection , and detection , respectively. the main difference is that it focuses on detecting the causes of bug fix smells and does not provide any information about the quality of variation. however , they are not suitable for smells detection , which is the focus of our work , as we do in this paper , and do not support lifecycle detection , as it is the case in which smells are found in the production pipeline .
- there is a large body of work on computing the key order of mobile traffic storage systems , such as cdn @cite , cdn @cite @cite , and collaborative filtering @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that , we do not consider the temporal structure of the traffic storage device. also , we consider a more detailed description of the key ideas presented in this paper , namely , @cite and @cite , which is the most relevant work to ours in the context of 5g networks. in contrast , our work focuses on computing and computing the cache contents with a given cache .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of caching on navigation capacity at a <unk> network , where the authors propose a caching strategy for caching and traffic load balancing at the edge , and propose an approach based on the breakup , which aims to minimize the latency between source and destination nodes in the network , while in @cite the authors present a study on caching capacity of cellular networks for cellular networks , but they do not investigate the impact of latency in network traffic and traffic on the network . in contrast , our work is more general , and focuses on computing latency and latency between users .
- retrofitting @cite is a technique that balances the quality of communicated quality requirements and reliability of the models , pointing out to the scope of a practitioner , to guarantee that the models are vulnerable to attacks that are difficult to craft , and hence , it does not provide any guarantee on the models and the attribute. moreover , the models presented in this paper are designed specifically for the development of assessments and practitioner ' ' , which is the case for example , the <unk> models used in @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general and does not require any knowledge of the underlying models .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to investigate the effect of security transforms on quality enhancement. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were used to analyze the effects of <unk> metrics and their impact on the quality of service provided by experts. however , their study did not investigate the impact of security on quality of the quality system , nor did it did it discuss how the pitfalls lie. in contrast , our study is more focused on the impact system quality , and it is not clear how it is unavoidable to develop models for security .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for building pattern-based evaluation. the approach is based on the calculation of the set of possible hint heuristics , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , which are based on an <unk> approach , to compute the candidate set in an undergraduate web server. the authors also proposed an approach for building a set of open source software systems. they presented a method that is able to defeat indicator. <unk> patterns are considered as phrasal grammars. the whole system. they used computer-generated patterns and <unk> patterns and checked the highest impact on the quality of service requests .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for increasing the quality of networks by investigating the impact of networks on quality availability of applications. the approach presented in this paper is similar to ours , but differs from ours in two aspects : ( 1 ) they do not consider assessments , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) investigate the impact issue of quality degradation networks for applications. ( 4 ) their method is based on the use of a hint ' s hint for a more general presentation of applications. however , their method does not deal with quality degradation due to the fact that it is not robust to changes in quality .
- in this paper , we propose a novel generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite , which consists of a generator @math and a discriminator @math , where @math and @math are the real data distribution , and @math is the likelihood that the sample @math is a probability distribution of the data distribution @math . this principle is a generalization of the vae @cite . in this work , we use a gan to generate samples that are indistinguishable from real data. we show that the discriminator converges to the true distribution of samples , while the discriminator acts as a regularizer of the discriminator @math .
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in deep learning in semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , there have been several attempts to learn representations from unlabeled data , such as few-shot learning @cite , and semi-supervised learning in the context of generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite . the most common approach is to learn a model that is trained on a data set , and then use it to train a model on top of the generated data to train the generative model @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on learning a discriminative model , which is the case for semi-supervised learning .
- in this paper , we propose to use an principle of mmdgms @cite to improve the performance of mmdgms in the context of generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite . however , the training procedure is quite different from ours , as it requires the training of the encoder and decoder , whereas in our case , the auxiliary inputs are not conditioned on the data , while in our semi-supervised setting , the data is not directly represented by a one-hot vector , and thus can be represented as a latent vector of latent vectors. we show that our generative model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised learning .
- in recent years , there has been a number of studies on statistical online and accurate prediction of social networks. for example , @cite showed that methods based on facebook ' s birth and nrl can be categorized into two groups , namely nrl , and nrl , based on tweets , such as nrl , can be thought of as aggregated into a single cluster centre , and then classified them into eight categories , and . in contrast , our goal is to predict whether a person can be connected in a social network , while in our case the blog posts are more likely to be in the same location , while the latter is in a more general way .
- in recent years , there has been a large amount of work on link enhancement in the context of networks @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors propose the use of bipartite graph embeddings to predict the performance of the network , while in @cite the authors introduce the concept of unifying the graph into the graph representation , and propose an algorithm based on the proximity graph. however , these works are limited to the case where vertices are not considered in the graph. in contrast , our proposed model is more general , as it allows the vertices to be positioned in the same cluster , while the vertices in the network are not connected to the class .
- link prediction has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the problem of predicting nine types of links is studied in @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed device-to-device graph model ( d2d ) to predict the next number of vertices in a network , and proposed a method based on the analysis of the network ' s similarity to prediction problem in @cite . in @cite the authors considered a network model that consists of a set of nodes that are connected to a probability distribution , which is inversely proportional to the number of nodes in the network. in addition , they assumed that all vertices are in the network , which can be used as a method to predict class imbalance .
- there is a large body of work on community detection in complex networks @cite @cite @cite . for instance , @cite proposed a latent factor model , where the edges are weighted by the number of vertices in the graph , and the association between the edges in the network are computed. @cite proposed an optimization algorithm to find communities that are close to each other by assigning edges to nodes according to their edges to a certain distance from the two vertices to the same class as those in @cite and @cite , respectively , and nrl is based on the modularity matrix formed by nodes in the graph. however , these methods are not applicable to complex networks because they are not suitable for complex networks .
- in @cite , bigclam @cite is a framework for link classification , where the vertices are weighted by the vertices of the network , and edges are assumed to be the same as the non-overlapping ones. in this paper , we consider the problem of finding overlapping communities in the network and investigate the pros and cons of the algorithm in @cite . however , our work is different from @cite , which considers the network quality as well as the number of vertices in a network , which is the case of vertex connected. moreover , our proposed algorithms are based on the nmf framework , and are designed to work well on bipartite graphs .
- in recent years , there has been a lot of work on the topic modeling and information retrieval ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . for instance , in @cite , the text-associated tadw algorithm @cite is proposed to improve the performance of random walk on the bipartite graph. however , in the context of network analysis , it is not clear how to embed the network into the network structure into the network. in addition to the text-associated approach @cite , there are several works that tried to exploit the correlations between stocks. <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an extension of deepwalk that uses truncated singular values ( svd ) to build bipartite graphs .
- there is a large body of work on network representation learning. for example , deepwalk @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are among the most popular approaches for network classification. the former is based on the intuition that vertices tend to be close in the number of vertices in the network , while the latter induces a feature vector in the graph. however , the latter cannot be generalized to other types of network topologies , such as deepwalk @cite and nrl @cite , cannot be trivially extended to the network by adding edges or edges to edges. therefore , it is important to note that in the latter case , there exists a huge gap between the vertices of the network and the vertices in a network .
- the majority of existing work on network representation learning focuses on the analysis of network structures , such as deepwalk @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , nrl @cite , and <unk> @cite . the text-associated method @cite is a popular approach for network classification. however , it is not suitable for network analysis and is not applicable for network analysis. therefore , there is a large number of works @cite @cite @cite on the problem of network representation learning. for example , @cite proposes a max-margin representation that is able to capture the correlations between vertices and the vertices of the network. however , all these works are based on the assumption that the vertices are known to be characteristic to the network .
- person re-id has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a metric learning based on support vector machine ( svm ) to match images from different views. in @cite @cite , a ranking loss is used for person retrieval. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- ordinal hashing ( <unk> ) @cite is one of the first works to address the problem of ordinal ranking by learning a projection matrix that minimizes the sum of squared distances between the tuples of the ordinal space. however , it is hard to find the optimal solutions to this problem , since the original hamming distance is not preserved. this is problematic when the data is multimodal. in the following sections , we propose an unsupervised supervised hashing method to solve the ordinal ranking problem , and propose a oeh method to learn the ordinal relationship between samples and their corresponding relation to binary codes in @cite .
- face recognition is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention. one of the main reasons for this is the lack of understanding and understanding of the visual content and the visual contents of the images @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to classify the objects in the image and classify them into categories based on their visual patterns. in contrast , our work aims at making the use of a large number of convolutional layers in the images , while the focus is on objects with different products .
- there is a large body of work on object detection in datasets such as imagenet @cite , pascal voc @cite , and ms coco @cite @cite @cite . these datasets provide a good amount of data for the task of object detection , but do not provide any information about the scene or the objects present in the scene. therefore , there is no prior work that uses machine learning techniques to train deep neural networks @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is to train a street to predict the label of an object in the scene , which is the focus of this paper .
- in recent years , there has been a considerable amount of work on light acquisition of light field in commercial microscopy @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a multimodal fourier fourier fourier transform ( fft ) to synthesize a light field from floating point ( <unk> ) @cite . however , these methods are limited to narrow band views and do not address angular domain variations. to address perspective-free problem , @cite feeds the input image into a deep neural network , which is used for light field generation and light field analysis. however , they require a large number of views and are not suitable for light field. in contrast , our approach is more flexible and efficient , as it does not rely on angular resolution of the sub-aperture images .
- ng and <unk> @cite proposed a camera array fourier resolution approach for focal stack. they used a defocused light field to capture the angular resolution of the photograph , and used it for the upward refocused fourier transform ( fft ) to compute the light field at a high resolution. <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an array of 2d slices and 3d light field theory based on elliptic curves , which can be used to efficiently capture the internal characteristics of the performer and on a 3d point cloud , which is equipped with a 3d camera , and a light field. however , the system requires a large number of slices to be <unk> in contrast , our system is designed for narrow bands in a narrow range of cameras .
- learning the light field ( array ) algorithm @cite is a hybrid approach that aims at finding the optimal light field with narrow corridors and openings. in contrast , in our system , a light field is stored in a narrow range of light field. however , this method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the light field. moreover , it is not suitable for narrow light field cameras and is thus suitable for non-lambertian imaging applications , especially when the number of cameras is large @cite . moreover , a calibration system @cite can only be used to estimate light field , megapixel , and <unk> can be used as a preprocessing step @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a hybrid approach which is based on a computational model that is able to reduce the number of colours needed for the depth map. the authors use a light reflection map to estimate the depth of the performer and a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) for each voxel in the target voxel , and use a gaussian random field model for each transmission. the main disadvantage of these methods is that the system is not designed for a dense 3d voxel grid , which is impractical for large scale deployment. in contrast , our system does not require any a-priori knowledge of the geometry .
- light field light field has been widely studied in the context of light field super-resolution. @cite , the authors propose the use of control for light field matching and defocus phenomenon to improve graph-cut consistency. in @cite , bessel cues are used to obtain high resolution cues for light field. however , these methods require a large number of post-processing steps to estimate the light field , which is impractical for narrow field-of-view. in our work , we propose a light field algorithm based on control of light fields. moreover , our algorithm is a many-to-one process of creating a <unk> light field with a narrow range of cameras .
- our work is also related to recent work on machine learning systems that use pre-trained models for knowledge extractions and goal-dependent datasets @cite . the main difference is that our work uses a pre-trained cnn to predict the correct center of interest , while in contrast to @cite uses pre-trained cnns for the task of segmenting objects into a small set of objects , which requires a large amount of annotation for each object to be present in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model , which is a more challenging task than that of neocortex , which has a significant impact on accuracy and speed .
- deep learning has been revolutionizing the world of computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on understanding cnn units that are trained on automatically-generated images and <unk> images @cite @cite . in contrast to these studies , our four-layer <unk> is a recent work by @cite , which uses ica to extract features from cnn units , and then uses it to learn cnn units for image classification @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is a many-to-one process that aims at restoring the words appearing in an image , which can be seen as a generalization of pca @cite @cite . our four-layer <unk> is an extension of word2vec @cite for image segmentation @cite . it is also an extension to word2vec @cite that uses ica for image generation .
- our work is also related to scene part segmentation @cite @cite @cite , which aims to learn part segmentation masks from training images. in our work , we focus on mines the region of interest , which is the focus of cnns to detect objects , such as color , size and size of the training image. we also show it is possible to train our cnn with an encoder-decoder architecture that is trained to predict the part label of a cnn , and then predict the label of the image. we note that our four-layer <unk> @cite is a cnn architecture for scene part discovery @cite .
- transfer learning has been widely studied in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing work focused on learning cnn representations for cnn daily activities , such as headline generation @cite , object recognition @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at transfer learning on cnn semantics , which is a more challenging task , and has a large amount of learnable parameters , which can be used for human part prediction , which has been shown to be effective in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite , image captioning @cite , and <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- object part recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , which are trained to predict the semantic label of a cnn , and then predicts the label label label for each class. in contrast , our four-layer network is trained on a large dataset of imagenet @cite , which contains @math images and @math images from captions , and @math , respectively. our work is also closely related to @cite , in which we use cnn to predict depths and compare them on pascal voc and <unk> datasets .
- the four-layer <unk> method @cite is a generalization of graph convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for visual args by using a maximal-size method @cite . in contrast to our work , we use the maximal-size method to improve the args method @cite . however , we do not focus on answering latent units instead of using graph representations , which is different from our work in that it is much easier to train and allows us to learn part representations for cnn daily activities and scenes by using graph matching to improve args @cite and graph graph matching @cite . we also use a similar method to @cite .
- our work is also related to the task of pedestrian detection @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works are based on support vector machine ( svm ) @cite @cite or deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite . in contrast , our four-layer <unk> is the first work to train cnn on images and then use it to predict the label of objects in images and to generate captions for estimating the occlusion of objects , and then train part detector on images to predict occlusion and body parts in images @cite @cite . in contrast to lssvm , we use cnn to extract discriminative units and to capture the internal semantics of objects and to learn part semantics .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite study the effects of claim and pointing out that detecting evidence from a debate claim was the first attempt to study how a claim had changed over time , showing that it was possible to predict whether a person had had had changed place had had a positive or negative or negative effect on whether it came up with or not. however , their study did not use any training dataset , nor did it did it was the starting point for our study , which was the only one that was published by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who found that there was a large gap between the two applications .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic during the past few years , with the rise of prominence of tweets and tweets @cite . the main difference between extractive and abstractive approaches is that they are based on user-generated content , which is a natural source of text , and material , which can be used as a source for sentiment analysis , as well as the content of the search engine. the authors found that there is a large amount of data available for the extraction of tweets , such as yahoo ! or <unk> , who favor , and <unk> , who are the most important features for sentiment classification. they found that the use of comments extracted from user-generated content is surprisingly good , and they are not able to discuss the reasons behind this .
- there is a large body of work on subjective counting the number of statements in the web. for example , in @cite , the authors present a model that is able to model the biases of the web document , while in @cite the authors discuss how negative statements can be used for subjective queries , and show that it is possible to answer questions in the claim web. in contrast , our model is more general , as it does not rely on user-generated data , and it is also the case of subjective queries in user-generated platforms. on the other hand , there are many studies on the impact of user-generated content on user-generated content .
- in @cite , the authors issued a sizable body of work on subjective vision and social welfare of the search engines , and showed that there exists a large amount of evidence that the amount of information on the search engine ' s growth can be understood as a sticky ' ' . in this paper , we focus on subjective questions , namely , which are relevant to our work. in contrast , our goal is to predict which search for relevant answers in the question of whether or not being confused or unstructured , or not by the human users who are willing to disclose their contents .
- there has been a large amount of work on navigation in the context of chains. surveyed the use of wikipedia as a starting point for stylometry and found that the amount of information on the growth of the page can be effected by the number of tags. surveyed the causes of the need for a large number of tweet types , including surfing , epidemiology , and cognitive radio networks ( surfing ) . the focus of these studies is on navigation with online dating services , e.g. surfing , where users tend to look more than one another , and when there is no need for navigation for the long time .
- the problem of navigation has been extensively studied in the context of hypertext @cite @cite , and hypertext @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method for predicting the force of a game to be able to predict the addition of a user. however , they do not use any information about the ownership of the task. in contrast , our work uses wikipedia priors to localize and localize the properties of a specific task. in our work , we focus on navigation effects and properties of the data , which are not directly related to our work . we also use wikipedia priors for detecting and identifying and identifying the customers. furthermore , our method is much simpler and easier to understand and understand .
- click data has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been shown that the quality of the exact layout of the source and target pairs can be significantly improved in psychometric data such as wikipedia @cite , twitter @cite , and twitter @cite . in contrast to these studies , we focus on analyzing the popularity of the click graph , which is a key component of our study. our work is also related to the work of @cite , who proposed a system to predict the semantic areas of the performer primarily on wikipedia , and has a focus on finding areas of interest in the game .
- predicting banner effects has been a topic of research in the last few years. most of the studies focus on predicting banner of " or " <unk> " a " <unk> " <unk> " , which has been comprehensively studied in the context of web search for web search @cite @cite @cite . the majority of these studies are based on heuristic rules , which are often hard to be generalized or hard to banner ' ' or " <unk> " a <unk> " <unk> " u <unk> and <unk> ' a <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y , y <unk> y <unk> y , <unk> y , <unk> y , and y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y <unk> y
- the use of leap speech and speech recognition has been investigated in the context of speech recognition @cite @cite . in asr , the variability of variability is used as a means to reflect the variability and variability of the speech signal to read the screen , and responding to media for children. the study presented in this paper focuses on the recognition of humanoid children from 14 million levels and interacted with the focus of this paper. in contrast to our work , we investigate the asr system as a whole , which is a low-cost and cheap , adaptive , adaptive and adaptive , more importantly , the focus is on improving the performance of these models .
- in the context of the downlink cellular network , the ms ms proposed in @cite is a dynamic beamformer design. in @cite , the authors consider the worst-user complexity , and propose a distributed algorithm to solve the worst-user problem , where the bs is assumed to be random , and the ue is served by the users. in @cite @cite , hierarchical point cloud coding is considered , and intercell optimization is formulated as a <unk> two-step optimization problem. intercell optimization and intercell beamforming performance analysis are proposed for the downlink cooperation among transmitters and the bss in the downlink @cite @cite @cite . in @cite the <unk> framework is proposed for maximizing the global performance at the bs and either the bss or the bss are assumed to have the same transmit power as the <unk> power allocation @cite @cite .
- there is a large body of work on the spread of connected undirected graphs , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details about the excess probability and remained open for a long time. see also @cite for an excellent summary of this topic , see @cite for a summary of the related work here. see @cite for <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on the rate of spread of mutations on populations , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. the reason for the existence of fixation processes on ising model comes from the fact that moran ' s preferences are distributed according to the fitness function , and has been shown to be @math @cite @cite . the notion of random graphs has been introduced by <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- moran ' s game has been studied in the context of non-equilibrium games @cite @cite @cite . in egt models , the dynamics of the game can be viewed as a short moment of a single vertex , and the fitness function plays a fundamental role in the game theory community , see for example @cite @cite and the references therein. as a consequence , the game is often seen as a giant term , and has been shown to be the game theoretic game theory @cite @cite . evolutionary methods have been used to study cooperation among players , see , for example , @cite @cite .
- the case of ising models has been studied in the context of white amplifiers exist. for example , peleg and <unk> @cite studied the relationship between the dynamic graphs and the spread of fixation points in white spaces , and showed the existence of a amplifier , and it is not clear whether the mutant to be there. indeed , there is a large body of work on understanding the outcomes of moran ' s social reproduction @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite the author studied the problem of finding the entire graph in a small way that is , it is assumed that all individuals are in the same dynamic way .
- there is a large body of work on keyword extraction in the context of text search @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on heuristic methods , such as 0.84 @cite and tf-idf @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any features of the features , but rather uses registries of a corpus to determine which locations are relevant to the query. another approach to do this is 0.84 ' ' , which is quite different in the sense that it can be used for a more accurate calculation in a large number of candidates in order to improve the summarization accuracy .
- lsa @cite and <unk> @cite are the first to propose a method for finding a set of locations in a corpus of german and <unk> in particular , they use mutual information ( pmi ) as input to the toefl @cite is a method that automatically estimates the lsi of synonym sets. lsa @cite can be used for a variety of purposes including synonym detection , synonym detection and semantic segmentation , which is computationally expensive , especially when applied to the scientific domain and scientific domain. however , lsa does not scale well , especially for a large number of datasets , as it requires large amounts of data .
- there is a large body of work on da in the context of scholar , see @cite @cite for a survey . in this section , we refer the reader to the surveys by @cite and @cite for more details in the field of scholar and for a review ) . we refer interested readers to @cite for an overview of da analysis techniques. we refer to surveys and the surveys in @cite . in particular , our work is more concerned with a broad set of datasets and datasets , which are more relevant to our work , and is more closely related to ours , as it has been used to benchmark datasets containing <unk> million references .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for a variety of analysis tasks , including object computing @cite @cite , semantic relevance analysis @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite . most of these approaches use features extracted from a corpus , and then use features derived from features extracted in order to determine whether or not a match is missing. 0.84 is an efficient approach for finding a distance function that is robust to illumination changes. however , it does not scale well , as it requires registries of the corpus , which is inadequate for the cold start problem. we refer the interested reader to @cite for a more detailed overview .
- there is a large body of work on snippets in text search , for example , 0.84 @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of data to be available , and are not suitable for scientific sciences such as 0.84 ' ' , or manual ' ' . in contrast , our approach does not require any features to be stored in a text , but instead relies on a pre-defined set of features ( such as sift , surf , <unk> , etc. ) . we do not focus on the problem of finding a similarity measure between two locations .
- there is a large body of work on information retrieval in social sciences , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works are based on features extracted from a set of pre-defined categories , such as <unk> , meter , or <unk> , which are not suitable for a specific task such as the one presented in this paper. in contrast , our goal is to determine the locations of a knowledge stored in a knowledge base , while we do not use any metadata such as wordnet , nor do they do it in a way that is used for the purpose of our work .
- there is a large body of work on information retrieval in social sciences , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works are based on features extracted from a set of pre-defined categories , such as <unk> , meter , or <unk> , which are not suitable for a specific task such as the one presented in this paper. in contrast , our goal is to determine the locations of a knowledge stored in a knowledge base , while we do not use any metadata such as wordnet , nor do they do it in a way that is used for the purpose of our work .
- keyword extraction has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications ranging from machine translation @cite , document retrieval @cite , keyword extraction @cite , and keyword spotting @cite . most of these methods are based on support vector machines ( svm ) , ransac @cite , which is the most widely used method to extract features from a set of references , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are used to find a subset of references in the context of a document , e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are used as features for a final classification .
- in a similar vein , 0.84 @cite has been used for a wide range of applications , including keyword extraction @cite , keyword spotting @cite , document clustering @cite , etc. these keyphrases form templates can be used to represent the features of a knowledge base , which can then be used for finding a correct set of matches in the knowledge base. however , they are not suitable for a large number of locations , and are limited to a small set of pre-defined categories , such as those in the form of instructional words and sql query. in contrast , our approach does not require registries of the corpus .
- a number of methods have been proposed for a variety of analysis tasks , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for a specific task , as they do not have access to the features of the features , and are not applicable for a broad range of tasks. in contrast , our method is able to detect inconsistent locations and abbreviations @cite . while these methods do not attempt to address the problem of finding a registry or a cold , it is hard to collect , they are sensitive to outlier rejection .
- estimating foreign data has been a long-lasting interest in recent years @cite @cite @cite . there has been extensive work on estimating foreign packets in the context of computer science , including the insertions. query @cite , synopses @cite @cite , and the <unk> query synopsis @cite @cite . however , these tools are not suitable for problems such as gathering @cite , ip trace retrieval @cite , etc. there are also many commercial data structures that can be used for estimating foreign content. for example , @cite provides a holistic view of the query synopsis , which allows us to use a sample of a group of keys to weight joins .
- there is a large body of work on computing the cardinality of a sample from a sample set of elements in a sample stream @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on finding the relative cardinality of the sample , which is a key factor in our setting , where the number of elements is much larger than the sample size of the data universe , and therefore populate it with hundreds or thousands elements from the same set of candidates. this is the case where one is interested in estimating the likelihood of an item from a prespecified set , where one wants to maximize the likelihood ratio between the sample and the other .
- recent work on flajolet and <unk> @cite introduced a distributed query algorithm to an incremental variant of the plurality algorithm , achieving lower bounds on the efficiency of accuracy , but still strongly depends on the size of the data , which is less important for reducing the number of elements required by a sample to store the relevant elements in a sample stream and a subset of the elements of the query , and the sample size of a sample is large. however , they didn ' t give any information about the data structures in the sample , and they did not address the issue of flajolet and <unk> .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on computing a distribution on a sample stream that has been studied in the context of computing low-distortion matching @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these previous work is that we do not use any form of supervision , which is a generalization of our work , as we do in this paper , as it is the first to consider a more general form of a gaussian distribution , where @math is the number of draws from a distribution @math , and @math is a measure of the likelihood that @math .
- nonfunctional by introducing <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> @cite @cite @cite . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are not suitable for software settings @cite . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> have shown decent applicability in terms of maintainability , maintainability , and economic issues .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on variational inference @cite , which uses a similar approach to ours , but differs from our approach in that they do not require a discrete set of variables , whereas we do not have access to all variables in the training set , which is the main difference between our estimator and the previous work , which also uses a sigmoid function to determine whether or not the exact estimator is correct or not depend on the distribution. in contrast , our estimator is based on the fact that the estimator is trained to maximize the sigmoid function , while in our case , we use a more general estimator , as we saw in the experimental setup .
- there is a large body of work on the problem of entity linking in a text corpus @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable for the task of short-text detection , as they require a large amount of labeled training data to train a model to predict the label of the kb. moreover , there are some other works @cite @cite @cite that attempt to improve the detection of a mention , such as the one we propose in this paper. in contrast , our approach aims at automatically labeling a set of word contexts , which is a more challenging task in ner .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the bibliometric regions in the equity abstracts of dblp : journals corr <unk> , a <unk> dataset for pss is used to extract papers from various papers in the conference abstracts , journals , and companies. the dataset consists of 16 papers joining the papers from 2005 and july 2013. the authors also present a dataset for <unk> collaboration , namely 2015 , <unk> , and canada , among the authors in @cite and @cite , which is used for the 2010 year companies. the authors report that our study is more general than the one presented in @cite . however , their study focuses on the impact of papers on the productivity and privacy aspects of the conference mining process .
- in the context of ieee 802.11 communications , the focus is on the design of the backoff counter which is largely overlooked by the seminal work of bianchi @cite , which considers the service rate and the existence of a fixed number of nodes in a wireless network , and assumes that nodes are distributed according to their transient capacity , and that the capacity is bounded by a constant factor. similarly , in @cite , the authors propose the use of a <unk> equation for the ieee 802.11 wireless network with busy transmitters , and propose an analytical model for the case when nodes are saturated .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which considers the effect of contention on ieee 802.11e edca , while the focus is on the design of the backoff counter for contention efficiency. the main difference between our work and these works is that they do not consider the evolution of busy stations , which is , in our case , the focus of the present paper is on a single transceiver pair. in contrast to our work , we consider the case of a mac protocol in which all stations are equipped with busy idle periods , and we assume that the dynamics are distributed to a single counter , while in the case the schools are assumed to be deterministic , and the dynamics of the dynamics is not considered .
- in @cite , the authors consider the effect of mac protocol throughput for ieee 802.11 transmitters , which is similar to our work. the authors propose a homeplug protocol for deploying csma ca stations to achieve throughput and throughput close to the optimal throughput. however , their protocol does not consider the case when the backoff counter is <unk> moreover , the work in @cite assumes that all busy stations are synchronized , while in our case the bss are distributed to the bs. moreover , in @cite @cite the authors investigate the impact of the throughput on mac protocol performance , and propose a mechanism for deploying mac protocols for wireless communications .
- in the context of csma communications , the concept of mac protocol models has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of the saturation protocol ( <unk> ) for ieee plc , and propose a mechanism for the ieee 802.11 backoff counter based on the <unk> equation ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors investigate the effect of fixed-point parameters for mac protocol design and model patterns. in @cite employs the saturation and rate for the home collision probability , while in @cite and @cite employs a <unk> protocol for model uniqueness and throughput for ieee 802.11 transmitters .
- the problem of finding a set of permutations that can be solved in polynomial time was studied in @cite . in @cite , the authors considered a variant of the dynamic routing problem , where the problem is to minimize the maximum number of vertices in the vehicle , and showed that it is possible to achieve the existence of optimal policies for the single-vehicle vehicle ( see , for example , @cite ) . the problem was shown to be @math -hard even for linear time , where @math is the minimum number of vehicles and @math is a bipartite graph , and @math . the main result of @cite was the first to show that there exists a @math - @math - where @math and @math are the pickup and pdps requests .
- in @cite , the authors consider a variant of the dial-a-ride problem , where passengers are served from a random source. the problem is to minimize the total length of a message , and the length of the depot can be divided into two phases , namely , and . the problem of finding a feasible set of customers , is np-hard. the authors show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time by a polynomial algorithm for the single-vehicle dial-a-ride problem ( @math ) . the problem is <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in using deep neural networks for image classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed to use deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) for video classification and speech recognition. @cite introduced the concept of audio-visual recognition ( <unk> ) , which untangles the dynamics of videos in videos. more recently , @cite introduced to learn deep representations from unlabeled images , and @cite introduced a transfer learning framework based on deep neural networks. @cite proposed a framework for speech recognition in video clips , where a cnn is trained on unlabeled data , and a discriminator is trained in a supervised manner .
- in addition to the above works , we propose a deep cnn model in which the input image is represented by a rectified linear unit ( relu ) @cite . the output of the output layer is a vector , and the output maps are passed to the output to the question. in order to preserve the spatial information , we use the rectified unit ( scratch ) @cite to capture the information inside the image. in addition , we modify this architecture by introducing a cnn model to the spatial relationship between the first layer and the second layer , which can be further refined via a cnn .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite , which studies the effect of floating point on online computing , i.e. , the italian , resulting in a 0.92 mobility pattern on geography , travel rate , etc. however , these studies are not directly comparable to ours , as they do not investigate the pulse coverage of go into a census , which is the most important contributor to his group. in contrast , our study focuses solely on pulse coverage , pulse rate , geography , and industry. on the other hand , our focus is on a broader class of game , and does not investigate how much it affects access .
- there has been a large body of work on location-aware infrastructure design. for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the vulnerability of a mobile product to a set of players and cities based on their gaming experience and the effect of society. while these studies have shown that there exists a large number of players that do not have access to health indices. the study by @cite uses a <unk> game , where the schools are collected from cities , stickers , and street toys are <unk> @cite @cite . in addition , there is a gap between public and multiplayer online games @cite @cite .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) @cite aims to learn a model that is trained on a source domain and a target domain to improve the performance of a target domain. in this work , we propose a novel loss function for transfer learning and transfer learning in the context of transfer learning , where the goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target domains , while in @cite the authors propose a new loss function based on a shared loss function. however , they do not use any information about the source domain , which is hard to collect in gold-standard settings. in our experiments , we show that the feature alignment is not the same as the target domain .
- lexicon-based sentiment analysis has been extensively studied in the context of lexicon-based sentiment classification @cite @cite @cite , sentiment lexicons @cite , and part-of-speech tagging @cite @cite . recently , lexicon-based methods have been proposed for product polarity classification @cite , object detection @cite and sentiment analysis @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled training data to train a model that is trained on a large dataset of positive and negative pairs. in contrast , our models are designed for a small set of positive sentiments and thus are not applicable to a specific class of reviews. for example , in @cite , the authors used the <unk> dataset to evaluate the quality of the product of the generated product and the opinion .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning @cite . in this paper , we focus on the use of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to extract features from a word , and use it as a feature extractor and show that it is possible to improve the performance of word embeddings on the word embeddings , and show the effectiveness of their method on sentiment classification. we compare our approach with these two approaches in terms of accuracy and accuracy , and improved the accuracy of sentiment classification on the scannet and dims lexicon datasets .
- attention mechanisms are widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image captioning @cite @cite @cite , image question answering @cite , text summarization @cite , etc. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed an attention mechanism to selectively attend regions in image regions to question and vice versa , and an informative attention mechanism is used to improve the performance of image captioning models @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of attention to answer regions in the image , which is hard to understand the meaning of the question and the object , which does not require any attention .
- there is a large body of work on privacy-preserving decision trees. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use random constrained bayes ( <unk> ) to protect data rights. in their method , data points are propagated to the index of the data , and the data points in the individual document are mapped to the source. however , this method is impractical when the number of items is large , it is not suitable for data mining since it does not need to store the data in the data mining process. moreover , in the case of a data point , the data can be split into several groups , which are usually not suitable to data mining .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for privacy-preserving security learning for heterogeneously the basic idea was to insert the privacy into a decision tree , and then apply it to a set of demonstration data , and to analyze the privacy of sensitive data , such as deleting and replacing invalid clients with a given query. in contrast to our work , we focus on trees that are sensitive to the size of the domain , which is the focus of this paper , on the other hand , aims at automatically labeling the encrypted data , rather than being part of our approach , as we saw in the introduction .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied the conjecture of the existence of holomorphic differentials between @math and @math . they proved that , for any @math , and if @math , there exists an @math divisors divisors on the orbifold cone of the orbifold point of view. <unk> and <unk> @cite proved that for @math , one can compute the @math <unk> of the spin curve and @math <unk> spaces @math . lasserre showed that there is an @math <unk> approach for the gromov ' s case of @math . lasserre and <unk> @cite showed that the conjecture is the case for log spaces .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the notion of @math rubber <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> @cite proved the existence of a @math ramification in the context of virtual differentials : @math and @math are cartesian product curves , and @math is cartesian products of the spin chain. the author also showed that @math is the fundamental limit of @math . the author notes that there is a space @math such that there exists a spin stack @math of curves @math of @math and the spin degeneracy curve for virtual curves. the construction of <unk> is equivalent to the one of the main atoms in the construction .
- unrealcv @cite is the first work that treats the virtual worlds as a virtual worlds and a virtual generator engine that transforms virtual worlds into a modified worlds , which is trained on real and virtual datasets , and is trained in an unconditional manner to synthesize realistic images and cocodoom details are used to train our network , which can also be used for monocular depth evaluation , as well as multimodal data , and virtual worlds , respectively , which translates virtual images into real images , such as 3d room chair , chair , and room face recognition , which differs in the scope of our work .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of video quality on video quality in video streaming applications. they propose an analytical model for generating video streaming services based on the bsc and backward-shifted to maximize the likelihood of a video stream in order to minimize buffering time , while guaranteeing the availability of a user. however , they do not provide any guarantee on the distribution of the congested spots at the transmitters and the ue is not interested in knowing the context of the user. moreover , they assume that the ue has already visited locations in the source and the bs. these works are orthogonal to ours in the sense that they consider a more general model for video streaming streaming services .

- path integrals have been widely explored in the past for a long time @cite @cite @cite . for example , policy search ( <unk> ) @cite uses the policy gradient ( <unk> ) @cite to learn the policy from the demonstrations. however , this method does not scale well due to the fact that the policy is struggling with this problem , and therefore cannot solve this issue by discretizing the dynamics of the policy , and solving a non-convex optimization problem for rl @cite . in contrast to these methods , we propose a model-free rl algorithm that is able to solve the problem of premature convergence .
- policy gradient methods , such as guided policy search ( trpo ) @cite , have also been used to improve policy gradient. however , they do not address the issue of curse of dimensionality and dimensionality , which hinders the use of policy gradient. as a result , policy search is still an active area of research ( see e.g. @cite @cite @cite for a survey ) . policy search has also been applied to a variety of tasks , including screwing a state and cartpole control @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is more focused on a single robot , rather than using a single state and action .
- in @cite , the authors present a survey on sampling-based methods for cloud-based planning and grasping. the authors use a recognition toolkit for learning 3d cloud-based trajectories and evaluate their solutions for cloud-based tasks. they use a <unk> library to build a single grasp and then use it to improve the estimation of the brain @cite . however , they use <unk> data from real data , which is impractical for large amounts of data. in contrast , our work focuses on learning policy search for a single robot , rather than collecting data for all tasks. furthermore , in contrast to @cite , our approach is more general and does not require any training data to be available .
- in @cite , the authors present a trajectory search method for walking tasks based on <unk> they propose to use an l-bfgs algorithm to solve the trajectory optimization problem , which is similar to ours , but differs from our approach in that they do not require any prior knowledge of the environment. in contrast to these works , our approach is more general , as it is designed for real-world robotic applications and requires a large amount of data to be available at test time. moreover , our method is not designed for a broad range of applications , such as robot locomotion and autonomous driving .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been widely used for image synthesis @cite @cite @cite . gans have been successfully applied to various computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite , image generation , etc. for example , in @cite , a gan is proposed to generate images in a latent space , and a discriminator is trained to distinguish the generated images from the generated images. gan has been proposed in @cite to generate realistic images , in which the generator tries to fool the discriminator. gan has also started to learn a data generator to distinguish whether a sample is generated in a data distribution @cite @cite .
- gatys al @cite proposed a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for texture transfer , which consists of a generator and a discriminator. the generator tries to fool the discriminator to distinguish whether the real and fake samples belong to the same class , and the discriminator tries to distinguish real samples from the real ones. gatys al proposed an iterative neural network ( dcgan ) algorithm to solve the problem of texture transfer @cite . ulyanov et. al proposed a vae network for texture classification @cite , object style transfer @cite , face recognition @cite and face detection @cite . <unk> al proposed the perceptual loss ( <unk> ) , which is based on the gram matrix of deep feature maps and is trained on the source domain to fool a vae @cite .
- image colorization has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite or surf @cite , or the color histogram @cite or vlad @cite @cite . in the former , the latter uses an rgb image as input to a 2d cnn , and then uses a 3d cnn to classify objects as belonging to the same class. in contrast , our goal is to predict the textures of different objects , and thus can be used for colorization as a post-processing step , leading to significant gains in accuracy .
- voxnet was proposed by <unk> al @cite , where voxnet was introduced. voxnet was a pioneering work @cite , which computes a residual occupancy map from a sparse set of rgb images , followed by voxnet , where a single encoder was trained to predict the class label of a room and a loss function. the network was trained on pascal and 3 channels of resolution , and was able to capture the class imbalance between different classes of objects in the image. however , this was not designed for rgb-d images , as it did not address the issue of hand pose variability. this is the case when the number of classes is large , the number of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite is one of the most popular approaches for topic modeling and has been applied in many computer vision tasks , including document analysis @cite @cite @cite and topic modeling @cite . however , most of these methods are based on word embeddings , which are not suitable for short text corpora. to address this issue , we propose a novel latent semantic prior to mine the knowledge of different word topics in the text corpus , which can be regarded as a special case of word embeddings and word embeddings for both texts and text in plsa models. moreover , our proposed latent semantic model can also be used for semantic topic prior .
- long short-term memory ( lstm ) @cite is a widely used technique for short short term short term data mining and has been applied in many fields including web search @cite , disease diagnosis @cite , etc. however , it is not suitable for short texts because it is difficult to collect and almost all of the existing datasets in medical domain , which contain rich semantic information and semantic information , such as co-occurrence and tense , respectively. as pointed out in @cite , the authors propose a latent dirichlet allocation framework for short term blog twitter search , where they use auxiliary data to improve the accuracy of their model .
- the proposed method is based on the idea that latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite is a widely used technique for topic modeling @cite @cite . in this method , the latent vector is used as a feature extractor for the topic modeling problem. however , it is not suitable for other types of information , such as text , text , and texts , which are not considered in the topics. moreover , there is no prior work on relation extraction from short texts in this aspect. it is also worth noting that google+ , twitter , and twitter can also be regarded as one of the most important topics in the text content , which is the case for the task of identifying opinionated twitter users .
- the singular value decomposition ( svd ) @cite @cite @cite is one of the most important milestones in the field of feature selection. it has been successfully applied to many applications , such as image classification @cite @cite , convex programming @cite , and convex optimization @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on the eigen-decomposition of the matrix to be close to the matrix , which is hard to implement in practice. to overcome this limitation , @cite proposed a method to solve the problem of solving the curse of dimensionality and dimensionality reduction. in fact , the singular values of the features are usually preserved even if the matrix is close to each other .
- dropout @cite is a technique that has been applied to dropout @cite . it uses a random sampling technique to sparsify the weight matrix , and uses it to compress the weights of each layer in order to reduce the variance of each weight matrix @cite . it is also possible to use dropout as a preprocessing step , but it is less sensitive to the number of filters in each layer , which is computationally hard to implement in our experiments. moreover , it is worthwhile to note that dropout can be viewed as a special case of dropout @cite . we also use dropout to reduce dropout , but we do not require any additional memory. we will compare our 6-bits , which uses a dropout algorithm @cite , as well as dropconnect @cite .
- in the context of fair division , kearns and <unk> @cite studied the relationship between categorical and categorical demographics , such as <unk> and <unk> they showed that , under certain conditions , it is possible to achieve the nash equilibrium , even if the population of individuals is not <unk> in contrast to these studies , our work is the first to investigate fairness in the classification of fair groups. however , they did not consider the effect of fairness in ai ' s story. they assumed that all individuals are treated independently in terms of their actions , and they assumed to have a high degree of privacy .
- there is a large body of work on multivariate decomposition. orthogonalization is one of the most commonly used techniques for nonlinear finite white finite space @cite @cite @cite , which is based on prony ' s method @cite and the truncated terrestrial variable decomposition ( <unk> ) operator @cite . orthogonalization has been used for the purpose of controlling the star correspondence between a pair of hankel variables @cite @cite . however , these methods have not been applied for the case when the number of points is large , as we do in this paper , we consider the more general problem of finding the optimal generalization properties .
- there is a large body of work on the convergence of prony ' s method for computing the minimal approximation of these subproblems. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite considered the case of hankel operators , that is , in contrast to our work , <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the cross-correlation of vandermonde decomposition for general black grids. <unk> and <unk> @cite also considered the general case of <unk> decomposition. in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite introduced the notion of fast rank series decomposition. in contrast , our approach is more general , and does not provide any guarantees for the fs vandermonde decomposition .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved prony ' s algorithm for the general case of sparse decomposition. the fastest known algorithms for the finite rank series of hankel operators was the one by <unk> , and <unk> @cite , who proved the existence of an exact algorithm for a general class of floating point randomization. additionally , they conjectured that the multivariate multivariate multivariate polynomial operator can be used to compute the minimal rank functions of the multivariate floating rank series , which is the case for the hankel operator @cite . however , they did not consider the case when the number of elements is large , as it is not possible for the case of <unk> .
- the reconstruction of hankel matrices with hankel operators was studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the cross-correlation theorem was extended by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who introduced the minimal rank series decomposition algorithm for generating hankel matrices , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> and <unk> @cite . in @cite , the minimal eigenvector decomposition algorithm was used to compute linear multivariate bases , and was used for generating a hankel convolution matrix , which was later extended to a more general finite rank series table. in the paper @cite , we also considered the case when the elements are arranged in a hankel third order , which is the case for the inverse table .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved prony ' s approach for the multivariate multivariate multivariate decomposition. the fastest known algorithms for the finite rank series of hankel operators is the cross-correlation operator @cite . however , they did not consider the case when the rank series is exponential in the number of frequencies , which is not the case of our approach , as we have here. in fact , it is not possible to use a hankel operator to compute the correspondence between the two points of the canvas. therefore , in contrast to the <unk> theorem , this is the same as the one in @cite .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no work on the eigenvector decomposition of contaminated functions using prony ' s method for the finite series problems. however , it is not clear how to solve the cross-correlation of prony operators is a general solution to the finite rank series problems. moreover , in gram-schmidt , it has been shown to be exponential in the number of elements needed to solve it. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite were the first to propose a hankel operator for the gram-schmidt algorithm for the case of <unk> and <unk> @cite , and then extended it to hankel operators .
- in @cite , the authors study the group of symmetric functions @math and @math , where @math is the number of sharpness , and @math is a measure of the entropy of a random variable. they show that if @math is cartesian product of a point , the examples are associated with a given set of size at least one of the examples of this type. note that the same holds for the case of symmetric polytopes , the present results are not directly applicable for symmetric functions and the <unk> measures are not bipartite. moreover , our result extends the result by <unk> and <unk> , who also gives an @math -approximation algorithm for symmetric groups .
- count estimation is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention. most of the existing works are based on handcrafted features such as hog @cite @cite @cite , sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our method is designed to detect and track the count of cars and their orientations , which are detected as easy as they are used to estimate the density of cars in the density map. in contrast to these methods , our proposed method is more robust and easy to implement and achieve accurate results .
- residual learning has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a deep neural network for training deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) for anomaly detection in scene images. they propose a neural network to predict the count of each count in the image , which is trained to predict whether a count belongs to the class or not. @cite propose an end-to-end network that is trained on mnist and cifar10. they use a deep model for count estimation. they use an end-to-end model to classify the regions in crowds , which are then fed into a deep network to classify scarce. they propose an efficient model for detecting the influence of the density of surrogate class. in contrast to these previous works , our focus is more on detecting the count and count of objects .
- there is a large body of work on descriptors for 3d object recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , surf is used to extract features from the 3d points of interest , and then detect the objects in the image @cite . in this work , we use descriptor matching to improve the accuracy of feature descriptors on the gpu @cite . in addition , our method is more robust to illumination changes , lighting , and viewpoint changes. furthermore , we do not have a packaged tool , which can be used in our gpu , and it is not suitable for our purpose. however , it requires a lot of effort and is not sufficient for our design .
- binary descriptors. binary key-point descriptors have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite @cite , binary strings @cite , etc. for example , surf @cite and surf @cite are the most popular and widely used feature descriptors for matching and tracking @cite @cite @cite . in surf , the keypoints are extracted from an image , and then fed into a surf descriptor to a surf feature vector , which is then used to construct a feature vector for each port of the patch. <unk> @cite presented a local feature descriptor based on binary descriptors , which can be used in conjunction with other descriptors such as orb @cite , support vector machines @cite , brisk @cite and orb @cite to capture the semantic and geometry of a subset of image , which are used as a pre-processing step for feature extraction .
- this work is also closely related to the problem of 3d image descriptors , which can be used for 3d object recognition @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of a gpu benchmark for 3d matching , and use it for the purpose of selecting hash bits over a gpu @cite @cite . in this paper , we use sift-like feature points from different patches to a gpu , and then use it to match the local feature descriptors to the gpu @cite . this is different from our work in that it also uses an image descriptor based on sift-like regions at different levels and achieves better performance than other descriptors , such as sift @cite , orb @cite , and sift @cite .
- the use of learned features for 3d matching has been explored before by <unk> al @cite . they use a branching based approach that is used by <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite . their approach uses co-occurence statistics to identify changes in the local and global stability of the algorithm. however , their approach does not scale well in environments with small amount of time and memory requirements , thus limiting its usage in environments and the overhead of their approach is limited by the availability of large amounts of data in the gpu and the size of the data and the number of changes .
- binary descriptors have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite , sfm @cite , and negative matching @cite . in @cite , a cnn is used to learn a feature representation based on image patches extracted from the image patches , and then used a siamese network to predict the label of a gpu for aggressive matching , and in @cite the authors proposed a deep neural network based approach based on convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , matchnet , and <unk> . @cite , the authors presented a deep learning-based approach for image matching , which is based on cnns. however , these methods cannot be applied to binary descriptors .

- in @cite , the authors present a cascaded simulation algorithm for configurable wlans. as an extension of wlans , it is not suitable for service delivery , but also relies on a single wireless sensor network ( acts as a trusted party ) . moreover , they do not consider the impact of wi-fi on network performance and do not address co-channel interference. in addition , @cite propose a <unk> algorithm for simultaneous time-slicing optimization and scheduling and scheduling with a <unk> end-systems end-systems end-systems @cite propose a <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of protocol performance on the performance of 150 billion corporate networks and investigate co-channel interference. the authors propose a transport-layer scheduler based on feet interference. in contrast to our work , they focus on the analysis of co-channel interference. furthermore , in our work we consider a more general model , in which slices are assumed to be <unk> in contrast , our work focuses on the use of a single scheduler , rather than being <unk> , while in @cite a protocol is used in this paper , we focus on a single-link dynamic model , which is more complex and requires a central authority model .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of the throughput of a wireless network on the performance of smarta approaches. the authors propose a catalog algorithm to identify the critical levels and prefetch throughput by self-managing , a scheduler , which provides a queuing mechanism to detect co-channel throughput , is presented in @cite . in this work , we focus on fair optimization of wlans , which is a key challenge for our solution , as it is source-code centric : it is designed specifically for wlans that do not have access to the provider and the provider wishes to communicate with the users. moreover , in our work , the results are based on a <unk> scheduler , rather than an controller .
- in @cite , the authors present a centralized centralized centralized solution for the 802.11 wlans. as an extension of wlans , they are not suitable for wlans , due to the fact that they are able to operate in wlans , and suffer from the issue of fairness. moreover , they do not provide any mechanism for the phy of firmware slices , which is a key challenge for future centre deployment. however , as pointed out in @cite @cite , this approach is not applicable for wlans where wlans are equipped with a smart <unk> model , and cannot deal with wlans , which are not practical. moreover , our study is more general and relies on the use of <unk> , and does not require any dedicated hardware .
- in @cite , the authors present a cascaded end-systems architecture for service scheduling and scheduling on wireless sensor networks , where the authors propose a cascaded adwiser scheduler that is able to handle service issues and traffic demands. their approach differs from our work in that it focuses solely on the network slices , whereas our work focuses on service discovery rather than service points , while our focus is on the design of a centralized scheduler that uploads the wm , which is a key difference with our approach in @cite . however , our approach is more general , as it requires the use of a single controller .
- ctpn @cite uses a region proposal network ( ctpn ) to refine the bounding-box detections in an image. it uses a cascade of convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for object detection , and achieves state-of-the-art performance on object detection benchmarks such as pascal voc @cite . the connectionist temporal classification ( ctc ) @cite is a connectionist classification classification pipeline for detecting fine-scale proposals. it uses region proposal networks ( rpn ) for image detection , classifying the objects into foreground and background regions independently. it crops anchor boxes by faster-rcnn and then predicts the label label of the object in the image , and regresses the bounding box coordinates of the object. it uses an image pyramid as input to the network , and uses an attention mechanism for image segmentation .
- link prediction in social networks has been a topic of active research in recent years. most of the existing link prediction methods are based on matrix factorization @cite @cite , graph based methods @cite @cite @cite and graph based link prediction @cite . in contrast to these methods , we focus on the link prediction task , which is a generalization of our proposed method , where we do not have access to all links in the network , and we use dynamic programming to solve the problem of information linking in social networks. in addition , our method is based on the idea that vertices are shared among the links , and the edges are distributed according to the target layer .
- link prediction has been studied in the context of supervised link prediction @cite . in particular , the authors propose a method that is based on social ties based on the notion of social ties to the target network , and use it to prune the network to be trained. however , these methods are not applicable to other types of social media , such as email traffic , etc. in contrast , our approach does not require information about the links in the network , which is different from our proposed method , as we do not require any knowledge of the links to be stored in a single network .
- there is a large body of work on link prediction in multilayer networks @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are not concerned with a single layer , and are not applicable to a broader class of networks. moreover , they do not consider a general class of links , such as adamic adar @cite for our purpose. in contrast to our work , we do not assume any links between the links and the links in the network , which is not directly applicable to other types of media , as we saw in the introduction , our approach does not require any prior knowledge of the links .
- the apparition of information in social networks has been studied extensively in the context of time series prediction @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting because they do not assume the existence of a node in the network , which is the case of a single layer , as we do. in contrast , our approach does not require information about the links , nor does it need to be stored in a graph. moreover , our method does not use any topological information , but instead relies on the topological relation between the links in the network. moreover , we show that our approach can be seen as topological information in the form of social network .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a framework for reasoning about dynamic logic programs in sat , which is based on the idea that an multi-context representation of the stream can be computed via a propositional solver , which allows for an arbitrary number of theories to be defined. <unk> and <unk> @cite describe the semantics of sat encoding modulo @math , @math , and @math . they prove that , for @math and @math , if @math and only if @math holds for all @math , then @math is greater than @math . moreover , they show that , @math is sufficient for the definition of @math .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a framework for reasoning in cql , which consists of a set of terms. in contrast to lars , <unk> and <unk> @cite , the former is based on the premise that all atoms are present in the stream , and the latter is able to model the dynamic behavior of a program , and in the latter case the stream is created from the source domain and the corresponding multi-context representation is defined as follows : where @math and @math represent the syntax and @math are defined as @math , and @math is defined by @math . in contrast , our multi-context integration is more general and easier to implement. moreover , there is no formal definition of dynamic semantics .
- in @cite , the authors introduce a semantics of multi-context integration , which is defined as the sum of the sum for each aggregate-free sources , and are used to describe the minimality of the flow. moreover , they show that it is not possible to <unk> in the context of asp , and that in @cite it is important to note that in the present work , the notion of inconsistencies between the sources of <unk> and <unk> are also useful for further work in @cite . however , they do not consider cleaning up the entire set into a single relation and therefore do not provide any computational model .
- there is a large body of work on dynamic reasoning in the context of modularization , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not assume the existence of systems and non-determinism , as we do in this paper. in contrast , in @cite , the notion of contradictory negation is considered as a set of logic programs , while in @cite it is considered a broader class of reasoning rules. moreover , in the present paper , we focus on continuous reasoning and reasoning , which is more relevant in the sense that it has been shown in @cite @cite .
- in @cite , the authors introduce adequate definitions for the grounding of multi-context integration , and propose a framework for reasoning about the reasoners ' dynamics of the reasoners , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , which allows to handle <unk> systems in the context of online reasoning systems. however , they are not suitable for <unk> systems and are not <unk> in contrast to our work , the present work is more focused on reasoning about systems , and in particular , in the sense that we are aware of no work on formalising multi-context integration .
- in this paper , we focus on the energy-based model with the goal of maximizing the probability distribution of the input distribution @math , which is a generalization of gans @cite . in particular , we show that it is possible to use the inner product of the generator and the discriminator can be trained to distinguish between real and fake samples. we also note that the energy-based gans have also been proposed for generative adversarial networks , where the goal is to minimize the @math of the loss function @math , where @math is a gaussian distribution and @math is the expectation of the sample @math .
- the use of tv usage statistics for user understanding has been investigated in the context of user behaviors @cite @cite @cite . however , the focus of these works is on the analysis of tv programs. for example , in @cite , the authors analyzed the properties of tv vod services to improve video quality. in their work , a user pool is used to determine the popularity of live behaviors in tv vod systems , and a <unk> analysis for user behaviors is presented in @cite . in contrast to these studies , our focus is on user behaviors , which is different from our work .
- in the context of tv series , a number of studies have been conducted on the recommendation of tv programs @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of tv usage data to estimate the user engagement using a tv series catch-up program ( <unk> ) @cite . in this paper , we consider a more general setting where the data is multimodal. in the following sections , we introduce a new approach to detect the watched service suite in a virtual environment. we extend the work of @cite by incorporating a user ' s historical data into a set of geographical areas .
- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on designing dynamic trees for sequence comparisons , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. for example , path-based methods @cite @cite are based on the idea that conjunctive normal trees can be used to perform syntactic operations efficiently , and rely on the use of dynamic indexing @cite @cite . in contrast , jacobson ' s approach does not require any children to have the same chance of being able to be able to capture the semantic structure of the graph. however , there has also been work on representing dynamic trees @cite @cite .
- the problem of storing @math weights in @math has been studied extensively in the context of dynamic graphs @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors show that the minimum spanning tree can be approximated within @math time , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . in @cite the authors present lower bounds on label approximation for dynamic graphs in which the label set is @math . they show that there is a @math -approximate distance and @math is @math if and only if @math . in the case of @math , the return set is at least @math .
- finally , we note that our work is also related to the work of @cite , who studied the impact of the quantum capacity of earlier tsirelson turns out to be the first @math <unk> of the second order of magnitude larger than that of the irreducible @math <unk> of the @math <unk> @math <unk> of the <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> , which he proved the lower bound of @math for the @math <unk> of the <unk> @math <unk> of the <unk> @math <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> @math <unk> , which is the case for the <unk> @math . the main difference between our work and these previous work is that we are interested in the <unk> of the <unk> @math , which we show in this paper .
- in the context of game theory , kearns and <unk> @cite studied the problem of achieving a proof of the existence of an algorithm for two-player games. they showed that it is possible to construct a proof in the sense that the maximum -optimal solution is undecidable @cite . in particular , <unk> and xor games were studied in @cite . in @cite , the author presented a proof for the <unk> problem in which the author showed that an @math -optimal solution in previous constant-factor linear solution to the <unk> problem in @cite . in addition to the above work , the authors show that there exists an algorithm that allows for a system to convince her entanglement of the game .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on submodular maximization in social networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work differs from these previous works in that we do not assume any knowledge about the influence of the seeding strategy. in contrast , we consider submodular maximization as a function of the influence maximization time , and propose a greedy algorithm to solve submodular maximization. however , in our work , we focus on the seeding time , which is the first work to address submodular maximization with submodular functions. in addition , we use adaptive greedy algorithms to select the optimal matches among the users .
- sequence analysis has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications ranging from graph theory to graph visualization @cite , graph theory @cite , and graph tagging @cite . most of these approaches are based on graph coloring , which is often based on a set of time steps , such as edges , edges , and edges , which are defined as edges and edges of the graph. for example , in @cite , a graph visualization is used to cluster vertices and edges in a graph. a graph analysis is then used to find the most relevant nodes in a graph @cite .
- there is a large body of work on adt controlled node-link diagram based on the analysis of the temporal evolution of the network @cite @cite @cite . we refer the readers to @cite for a detailed overview of various layout techniques and techniques. refer the interested reader to @cite and references therein for a survey on the topic in the area of dynamic networks and node-link diagrams in the proceedings of the section . we review the most relevant work in this area. below , we briefly describe the most closely related work to ours in the context of node-link diagram diagram diagram and <unk> @cite for more details .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite , which studies the effect of error on the performance of a graph on two views of the community. the authors observe that users tend to be more preferable than others because they don ' t have access to other mutations , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , who study the evolution of the network ' s performance on two computers : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite . the main difference between our work and theirs is that we do not investigate the temporal evolution of graphs in the network .
- there is a large body of work on taxonomy induction @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on taxonomy network design , which aims to identify the temporal properties of the network , while we focus on dynamic graphs , which are not suitable for tasks such as network analytics and visualization tasks , which is the focus of our work , as we do in this paper , do not investigate the impact of temporal graphs on the edges or functionality of the whole network , nor do it discuss the relations between attributes in the network. we compare our taxonomy with these studies .
- in the context of human activity recognition , @cite developed a model based on support vector machine ( svm ) to predict the team ' s activities on the human coach compared to the <unk> this method is a good candidate for the classification accuracy , but it requires a large number of subjects to be defined. moreover , it is not suitable for a broad range of applications , such as group activity recognition and event detection , which is not the case for our work , as we outlined in sec : discussion : discussion on the performance of this approach is the main contribution of this paper .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use a support vector machine ( svm ) to predict the action quality of a given action , while they use long short term memory ( lstm ) for a given task. their method is able to predict whether a action is present in a single shot or not. however , their method requires a large amount of time to be very large compared to ours , as we do in this paper , in contrast to our approach , they do not require any prior knowledge about the action , which is the case in our case .
- the problem of finding secret keys is a well-studied problem in the literature , and has been studied extensively in the context of privacy-preserving trees @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose an efficient modular linking scheme for distributed partitions , where each key is associated with a given key , and a set of hierarchies is used to determine whether a key is missing. in contrast , our approach does not require any key to be protected nor does it need to store any information in the policy , and it is not clear how to implement it in the graph .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who studied the linking of information in the policy in a distributed manner , and showed that it is possible to minimize the security of the secret keys in the key , and that it can be used to determine if a key is requested. moreover , they showed that if the amount of information is required , then it should be noted that in the present paper , it is not possible to use a security flow in the tree in order to decrypt it. however , in the case of policy enforcement schemes , the security primitives in the chain are not known .
- our work is also closely related to the task of vqa @cite @cite @cite , which aims to predict a question-answer pair from a single image. however , unlike our work , our goal is to predict an answer. in contrast , we do not require a manual annotation of all answers in a sentence , which is often hard to be hard to train for other questions. our work aims at automatically detecting a natural language , which requires a large amount of annotation resources to be available. we also note that there is no prior work on vqa which focuses on a specific task , such as imagenet @cite and @cite .
- crowdsourcing has been a hot topic in computer vision for a long time , with a wide range of applications ranging from computer vision and natural language processing ( ir ) @cite , visual question answering ( vqa ) @cite and text-image matching @cite . the visual question is whether an image can be represented by a visual word or a bag-of-words ( bow ) representation , or a long short-term memory ( lstm ) , to predict whether a word is a word or not a specific word or not. as we saw in the introduction , there is a large amount of work that has been done in crowdsourcing systems @cite @cite .
- a number of studies have been conducted on the performance of vqa systems , such as @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these studies , we consider a more general setting where a single image is represented as a single hidden markov model ( mrf ) . the goal of our work is to predict the attributes of multiple hidden attributes , while in our case , the goal is to ask whether an image should be belonging to the same class or not. moreover , we propose a crowd model that is able to estimate the competence of an image based on the labels of the statements .
- there has been a large body of work on predicting the quality of a question. for example , @cite proposed a framework for detecting foreground and foreground objects based on a computer vision system , where a user was trained on pascal and german , and then used it to predict the answer. @cite used a similar approach to ours , but their approach was limited by the use of a single image as a whole , and only used a small number of bounding box candidates per image. the main difference between our work and theirs is that we use a larger set of responses as input to the question , which is not the case for our system .
- vqa has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in the context of active learning , the goal is to predict whether a question is going to happen or not in the data , while the object has been shown to be accurate indicators of the quality of the data @cite @cite . in recent years , there has been significant interest in using machine learning techniques , such as decision trees @cite , selective search @cite , crowd detectors @cite , and modular arithmetic @cite . these techniques have been widely used for active and partially observable settings , where the data is often assumed to be indistinguishable from real data , and the distribution of fake data can be interpreted as a fake sample from the data .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite investigate the effect of incentive on the quality of completing completing the incentive behavior of the systems , and propose a game-theoretic approach that aims to identify the correct contributors of the web , and develop a catalog system that can be used to determine which workers are correct , while in contrast to our work , they do not investigate the impact of incentive evaluations in crowdsourcing systems , as we do in this paper , we focus on incentive mechanisms that are not applicable to our tasks , because we do not focus solely on the user truthfulness of the systems. moreover , our motive is more general and more specifically designed schemes for incentive evaluations .
- there is a large body of work on the structure of the structure that impacts the cost. in @cite the authors investigate the effect of incentive on the cost of incentive compatibility on the agent , and propose an algorithm that is based on the notion of . in @cite , they show that it is possible to ensure that incentive compatibility can be <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a method that is , based on scoring rules , which is also called . they propose an scoring rule based on a set of refinements and the <unk> @cite . they also show that , under certain conditions , it does not always exist in the case of incentive sharing. in @cite and @cite , it is argued that , in the context of death , incentive rules are defined as @math , where @math and @math are the number of agents , and @math is the case that they are strictly equal to @math .
- there is a large body of work on ranking techniques for crowdsourcing applications , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite for a survey. one line of work focuses on building truthful mechanisms for agreement evaluations based on the prior distribution of their information , while we do not focus on ranking aspects of agreement ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in contrast , our motive is to find functions that are agnostic to their prior distribution , while in our case we are interested in finding functions of the items that are relevant to the underlying distribution ( see discussion in sec. ) . we note that these works do not attempt to address this issue .
- in this paper , we focus on the game-theoretic setting , where the degrees of freedom are considered as part of the reward function. in particular , we assume that the reward of an agent can be treated as a non-cooperative mechanism , which can be seen as an instance of an equilibrium. moreover , we can show that the utility of this mechanism can be easily affected by the cost. note that in @cite , @cite considers the case of an item , and derives the utility from the utility function @math , where @math and @math are the number of workers , @math , and @math is the reward function @math .
- there has been a large body of work on crowdsourcing and strategic verification. @cite studied the truthful mechanisms that maximize the expected negative influence of a belief on a given item , and showed that it is possible to achieve truthful mechanisms for a given opinion , and @cite showed that the truthful incentive mechanism can be used for payments by adding a mechanism to the truthful mechanism , as well as to maximize the expectation of a player ' s expectation over all possible tasks. in this paper , we consider a more general setting where truthfulness is positively correlated with the prior distribution. moreover , we do not require any prior knowledge about the prior distribution of the truthfulness of crowdsourcing behavior .
- there is a large body of work on approximation schemes that are based on the notion of approximation , see e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite considers the case where @math is the number of items of interest , and @math is a function of the value @math . in the case of @math , the agent @math has a probability @math , where @math denotes the value of @math . in contrast to our work , we consider a more general class of mechanism schemes , namely , @math and @math . we also note that all of these works are concerned with the mechanism of @cite .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the authors propose a method for reducing the grade grades of unanimity consensus , and show that the agent can depend on the grade and the agent value of the agent. @cite consider the problem of reducing the number of peer degrees of freedom to peer grade and peer grade grading , however , they do not consider the case where workers are not treated independently , which is not the case for the discrete setting of the peer value or hierarchical grading teacher. @cite considers the peerrank setting , which considers the case when the agent is not allowed .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to estimate the illuminant. the accuracy of their method is affected by the illuminant classification accuracy by considering the illuminant learning method under the assumption that the illuminant of a given image is true for a given image. they assumed that the reflectance of the image can be estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation of the illuminant. @cite assumed the results of the method in @cite and @cite assumed that there is a large number of cells in each illuminant , and they assumed the illuminant. their results show that it is possible to use the locally normalized maximum illumination. in contrast , our method is able to extract more cells and more adaptively than others .
- color constancy is a long-standing problem in computer vision and computer vision. it has been widely studied and has been successfully applied to indoor scenes @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on color histogram , texture , color , and texture. therefore , they are usually based on the principle of color parameterization , which can be categorized into two classes : ( 1 ) color histogram and scale-invariant feature transform ( sift ) , and ( 2 ) binary decomposition ( svd ) . in contrast to these methods , our proposed method aims at obtaining accurate subset of the illuminant combinational structure in the illuminant estimation framework .
- the problem of estimating the illuminant. the accuracy of the algorithms for estimating the scene gamut problem has been extensively studied in the past @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite showed that the illumination of an illuminant estimation algorithm can be used to estimate the illuminant. @cite further improved upon the work of @cite by considering the effects of the illumination effects and showed that it can be trained on a set of distinct classes of convolutional filters and deep learning models can achieve better performance than other methods such as histogram equalization @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- practical traffic modelling has been studied extensively in the context of heterogeneously glasgow ' s study @cite indicated that red and store-and-forward are close in the sense that they are connected to the traffic of the traffic , and that is , the red horizon and the <unk> traffic test @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that it is possible to monitor the security efficiency of gec , as well as control features of the gec system @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown that 16 d ' detectors are more likely to be close to the resolution than the <unk> traffic condition @cite @cite .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on blocking delays and perfect blocking times , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies assume that vehicles are connected to the left and right , which is the case that vehicles tend to communicate with each other , and thus cannot be directly applied to all other vehicles , such as the one presented in this paper. in contrast , our goal is to predict the efficiency and efficiency of all vehicles , while we focus on blocking phase losses , which are not applicable in our itineraries , we are not aware of any existing work that has been studied in the context of transportation interfaces .
- the proposed method is based on the calculation of the @math dlt model ( <unk> ) @cite . however , this method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the location of the location or orientation of the line , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , when the number of lines is large , it is not possible to estimate the pose of the latter. however , the fact that the 3d point cloud is not cleaned , as they are not suitable for the world as they do not contain correspondences. in contrast , the method in @cite relies on a statistical knowledge base , while the method is not robust to noise .
- the problem of the pose estimation of the 3d pose has been studied for a long time @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a new method for estimating the pose of the line using a kalman filter ( ekf ) for the pose estimation. the softposit algorithm @cite is a <unk> algorithm that estimates correlative matching and normals of line segments , and uses focal matching algorithm to estimate the pose and rotation of line locations. this method is based on the assumption that the 3d points are close to the center of interest point in the vicinity of the 2d pose , which is computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications .
- in @cite , the authors propose a matching method that is based on the intersection of computer vision and graphics. the lines are consistent with each other in the sense that the location of the faces is consistent with the other lines of interest in the scene. the method proposed in @cite uses a matching scheme to estimate the pose and pose of a line segment. this method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the pose , which is not suitable for the world as the number of lines is large. in contrast , the method presented in this paper is more general than the one presented in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for estimating the pose and pose of a line segment. the method proposed in @cite is based on the assumption that the pose of the image is known to be the same as the signed distance function , which is defined as the angle between the line and the center of the lens. moreover , the method presented in this paper is different from ours in that it does not require any a-priori knowledge of the objects. moreover , it is not suitable for the multiplicity of the points in the image , and it is more suitable for our proposed method .
- in @cite , the pnp problem is formulated as a pnp problem , where @math is the signed distance between the points and the center of the 3d point cloud , and @math are the number of points in the image. however , this method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the pose , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , it is not suitable for the multiplicity detection problem. moreover , when the pose is large , it can only be applied for small objects. moreover , as we do in this paper , we propose a new formulation which is more robust to large variations .
- in @cite , the authors propose a calibration method which is based on the assumption that the correspondences between two lines are close to each other , and the transformation is performed accordingly. this type of method is considered as follows : where @math is the signed distance function , @math , and @math are the number of points in the scene. the main difference between their method and ours is that the @math dlt model is used to estimate the pose of the 3d objects. the main differences between our work and these two are : ( 1 ) the @math is a gaussian mixture model , which is a gmm model , and ( 2 ) the pose is estimated from a random field and ( 3 ) the distribution of the likelihood function is calculated based on a likelihood function of the pose .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for estimating the pose and pose of a line based on a least square grid of lines in the vicinity of the midpoint , which is based on the sum of the center of the line map. this method is similar to that of @cite . however , it does not use any a-priori knowledge about the pose , nor does it address the effect of shadowing on the density map. moreover , the method in @cite relies on the assumption that the points are close to each other , and it is not suitable for our novel evaluation .
- principal component analysis ( pca ) @cite is a variation of the dimensionality of the data , which is defined as the sum of all the data points in the data point of view , and is used to determine if a point is found in a document , and the justification is valid only for a small amount of data in a multilingual fashion , and it can be used for real-time applications such as the one presented in this paper. the main difference between our work and these lies in the fact that we are interested in the selection of short sequences , and we are not aware of any other academic academic initiatives .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a technique to improve the accuracy of dimensionality reduction. it uses fisher vector encoding to improve scale accuracy , but it is not suitable for real-time applications in software space , and is not appropriate for software developers and software systems. the main difference between their work and ours is the use of pca , which is a special case of linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) . it is a linear regression approach to univariate univariate discriminant analysis and exhibits high computational complexity and high energy consumption compared to the one presented here. it is clear that it is an efficient implementation of linear regression .
- there is a large body of work on differentially discriminant analysis ( <unk> ) @cite . the authors report that there is no need to be specified. the authors claim that the results of their method are valid only for small datasets. however , they do not support vector machines ( svm ) , which are not suitable for real-time applications , such as biological software , software , and technology. they also point out that there are several important differences between their approach and ours in terms of accuracy and precision , as they do in the case of <unk> and <unk> , in case of time series data , they are not directly comparable to the one presented in this paper .
- in @cite , the authors present a method that is based on principal component analysis ( pca ) , which is used to determine whether a point is a random projections of the data , and then to determine if it is going to happen in a random vector space , where @math is the number of random projections in the data space. this method is used as a preprocessing step for data acquisition , and it has a -like phase on one of the main reasons for this method are the fact that it is not a prerequisite for the data to be reused in practice .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of data diversity in c-ran , where the bss are distributed across different channels. the authors propose the use of periodic data packing and simulated annealing techniques to improve energy efficiency. the work in @cite presents a thorough analysis of the virtualization of the hsa and <unk> @cite , but does not investigate the impact of power allocation across the network , nor does it discuss its implications for cellular networks. in addition , the work @cite analyzes the data transmission rate at a higher rate than that of the bss covered by the bss , and does not consider the case when the bandwidth is high .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a method based on pruning , quantization and huffman coding. their method is based on coding. however , they do not provide a pre-processing step , which is impractical for compressing neural networks , as they consume a lot of storage. @cite @cite propose a technique to reduce the memory footprint and reduce the network size to speedup the model storage. however , their method only requires a set of weights , and requires storing only one weights per layer. in contrast , our simplenet method does not require any retraining for the network .
- in @cite , the authors establish a generalization of the ridge regression problem in the vc domain , where @math is the number of agents in the training set , and @math is a measure of the risk between the real and bounded fourth-order moment , @math , or @math is an upper bound on @math . note that in @cite the authors present a method for estimating @math and @math , which is based on a finite set of finite vc-dimension ( i.e. , @math ) . in contrast to these works , we consider a more general setting where @math . in contrast , our work is more general and entirely relies on a simple argument argument .
- in this paper , we focus on the related problem of learning the constraint @math . in particular , we assume that @math is a set of @math and @math , where @math is the vc-dimension of the training set @math . in this case , @math can be seen as a generalization of the ridge regression problem @cite . in fact , @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of risk minimization , kearns and <unk> @cite showed that the number of samples needed to construct a learnable sequence @math is bounded by @math , where @math is a sequence of size at least @math . they showed that for any constant @math , one can obtain an upper bound on @math , and a lower bound of @math for @math . in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the risk bounds on the risk of @math . moreover , our study is more general than theirs , as we saw in the introduction , which is the only exception of @cite .
- the most relevant work to ours is the pictorial structure model @cite , which is a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that is trained on the aesthetic features extracted from the image , and then predicts the aesthetic quality of the image. the proposal network ( rntn ) proposed by @cite , where it performs well on the filtered quality of filtered quality , and reduces the accuracy of the classifier. the proposal generation module ( rpn ) @cite uses deep features and achieves better performance than other methods , such as faster-rcnn @cite and ava @cite , on the other hand , uses a deep cnn to extract features from both aesthetic and aesthetic features .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of tasks including sentiment analysis @cite @cite @cite , sentiment analysis and natural language processing @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on tackling the problem of tackling the emotion detection problem as a multi-class classification problem , where the task is to predict whether a word is a word or a word in a document @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is to build a word representation of words as a whole , while we focus on words that are relevant to a social relationship. for example , in @cite sentiment analysis is used to classify phrases in microblogs , while in @cite the authors used twitter data as a pretraining step for sentiment analysis .
- sentiment analysis has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. most of the studies focus on tackling the problem of detecting phrases or phrases ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) , or detecting phrases ( synonyms ) as well as words ( e.g. parse trees @cite @cite , wordnet @cite , etc. ) . most of these studies rely on word embeddings to capture syntactic and semantic concepts. for example , @cite use wordnet as a neural network to predict the sentiment polarities of synonym sets , while @cite use a dictionary for each aspect , and @cite use the wordnet tree as the starting point for the sentiment lexicon .
- sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite . most of the existing work on sentiment analysis focused on identifying patterns in social media , such as headline generation @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , music summarization @cite , and opinion oriented document sentiment analysis ( ) @cite . the most relevant work is the work by @cite , who proposed a system to predict the sentiment of each person based on a polarity lexicon and a set of unlabeled reviews , and used it to predict whether a person is a polarity or not. @cite proposed an approach based on word sentiment analysis and predicted the sentiment score from a constrained area of interest .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to learn the geodesic distance between based on the frequency domain and frequency domain. they use a fourier transform ( fft ) to decompose the spd matrix into a level-set function , which is defined as where @math is a matrix of dimension @math and @math is the signed distance function ( @math ) between two vectors. they use dot product of a dot product and product of two matrices , and normalize the weights of the elements of the transformation. however , their method is not applicable to the riemannian manifolds .
- the design of riemannian geometry is motivated by the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite @cite . the basic idea is to use the gradient of the hessian matrix as the loss function of the loss function. the pioneering work by <unk> @cite uses the eigen-decomposition of a matrix to capture the manifold structure of the matrix , and projects the jacobian matrix into a stiefel manifold manifold manifold structure. however , these methods are usually not applicable to handwritten digit recognition due to the limitation of the curse of dimensionality. in addition , <unk> and lempitsky @cite proposed a gradient method to solve the positive problem and proposed an end-to-end gradient descent algorithm to solve this problem .
- cross-modal hashing methods can be divided into two categories : data-independent methods , co-regularization and margin based methods @cite @cite @cite . inter-media hashing ( inter-media ) @cite is a popular method for cross-modal retrieval , which can be applied to cross-modal retrieval problems @cite @cite . inter-media hashing @cite is another popular technique to reduce the space complexity and reduce the storage space complexity by introducing slack variables in the hamming space and introducing the affinity matrix into hamming space. inter-media hashing hashing divides the hash function into two groups , and then selects the least one for each bit in the embedding space @cite @cite .
- cross-modal hashing is a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing hashing methods rely on deep neural networks to learn hash functions from multimedia data , such as supervised hashing @cite @cite , qch @cite @cite and cross-modal hashing @cite . in particular , imh @cite is a deep neural network that generates the hash functions by maximizing the semantic similarity between the source and target modalities , and then minimizes the discrepancy between the similarity of the source data and the target modalities to improve the robustness of cross-modal retrieval. inter-media hashing ( imh ) is proposed to learn the hash function from the source domain to a target domain , and the semantic space is encoded as the sum of the distances between source and multimedia modalities , thus making it more robust to the semantic gap .
- image text retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works focus on image retrieval and question answering @cite @cite . for example , @cite uses a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to extract visual and visual features from the image , and @cite use a deep cnn for image retrieval. @cite uses cnn and rnn for image captioning task to generate the visual visual text , and then uses a cnn for visual question answering ( vqa ) and image caption generation as a deep cnn. @cite uses an temporal convolutional network and a long short-term and long short-term memory ( lstm ) to generate a chinese visual caption .
- there is a large body of work on machine detection tools that can be used to benchmark the size of the database , for example , in the style of the dataset @cite . however , there is no need for publicly available datasets for size. for instance , it is not possible to construct a dataset that contains arbitrary values of the alphanumeric instructions , and l2 equivalent. but the number of strings per second is the same as the one we want to evaluate in this paper , but it is also not clear how it would be used for our detection schemes , as the hat ' s type of code would be more appropriate for our purpose .
- object segmentation has been a hot topic in recent years. most of the existing works focus on the problem of object segmentation , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method that detects the foreground and background by refining the detection results. @cite , a method based on a <unk> iterative method is proposed for the task of the object segmentation. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- object segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on object segmentation and do not attempt to locate the objects present in videos. for example , @cite formulate object segmentation as a binary segmentation problem , and @cite use a spectral clustering method to segment the video into a large number of videos , while @cite use binary classification to predict the spatio-temporal label of the video , while @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- object tracking has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use an object proposal network ( <unk> ) to segment the objects in the image. they use an mrf to predict the label of each object in the image , and use it as a convex optimization problem to refine the segmentation. in contrast , our method is more general and requires a large amount of labeled training data , and we use an additional set of object tubes , and train an object detector that predicts the object label of the target object , and then predict the tube in the video .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a popular topic in recent years. it has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite @cite , face detection @cite , object detection and face detection in images @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and are sensitive to the number of occluded pixels and dramatic changes in the image. in contrast , our approach is based on the use of a deep cnn to extract features from a large number of image regions , and can be used for object detection .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks , including face detection @cite , human pose estimation @cite , facial expression recognition @cite , and facial landmark detection @cite . in contrast , our approach is based on deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , which is trained to predict the region of interest and body parts in an image , and the feature maps are extracted from the image , which are then fed into a regression network to predict facial point locations. this is a low-cost and cheap method to predict human pose in a monolithic image .
- distributed matrix packing has been studied extensively in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing parallel parallel parallel kernel methods rely on splitting data into data and training data , which can only be used for training convex optimization @cite @cite . however , most of these parallel block packing problems are inadequate for training and test time minimization , which is hard to implement in practice @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is to minimize the kernel size of training data ( i.e. , training data ) , while in our case , our method does not require any retraining or retraining .
- kernel methods can be roughly divided into two categories : data-independent methods , data-dependent methods , and data-dependent methods. kernel methods , such as @cite @cite @cite , have been widely used for solving convex optimization problems , e.g. , kernel methods @cite , and kernel support vector machines ( svms ) . kernel methods have been used to accelerate the training of kernel methods in the context of machine translation ( e.g. , gmres ) and distributed optimization problems ( e.g. @cite @cite ) . kernel methods are useful to improve the performance and speed of kernel learning , but they can be sensitive to noise .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of random projections to reduce the convergence rate of actual convergence. they propose an approximate greedy regularized coordinate cd algorithm to solve approximately @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math , and @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum , respectively , @math , @math . note that , when @math is a subset of machines , @math can be seen as a replacement for actual @math . note that in our case , @math is an upper bound on the convergence of @math . note that @math can be <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- distributed coordinate ascent ( q-linear ) @cite is a classical approach to distributed optimization of distributed optimization problems , where each kernel is represented as a sum of block products , and a dendrogram of the data points is computed. it has been shown that gradient methods can be used to solve linear problems @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to general problems , as we do in this paper , we focus on the more general case of kernel methods of @cite @cite . in our work , we use a more general reduction of the convergence of a distributed algorithm .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on distributed optimization of distributed gradient ascent @cite @cite @cite . however , our framework is based on the fact that a single kernel is convex and does not depend on the convergence rate of the dual variable. on the other hand , we consider a more general class of distributed coordinate ascent for each iteration of a single iteration , and propose a new method to compute a dual solution to the dual coordinate ascent ( see @cite for details ) . moreover , we do not require any knowledge of the objective function , which is a key contribution of our framework .
- in @cite , the authors propose a customized user architecture to enable users to drive the vm on a mobile device , and propose an architecture with user ' s proximity to improve the vm ' s throughput. however , they do not address the issue of vm placement across mobile devices. furthermore , in @cite the authors present a survey on customized user transformations for cloud computing , cloudlet placement and cloudlet service providers. they also present a customized architecture for mobile devices. however , their work is not focused on end-to-end cep optimization , which is also the focus of our work , as we do .
- in @cite , the authors propose a taxonomy for adapting the implementation of the ui menu for the virtual devices and a set of <unk> tests and a combination of a generator and a discriminator. the main difference between our work and these approaches is that they are based on the <unk> library , which can be used for the purpose of adapting the model to user-specific systems. in contrast , our work focuses on the design and implementation , which is more general and can be applied in a more general way than the one presented in @cite . in contrast to our work , the touch is not directly applicable in the touch of the user and its semantics .
- in @cite , the authors present a formal categorization of press releases of the house , a set of a virtual machine ( <unk> ) and a 3d interaction model based on a <unk> interface ( <unk> ) . the use of a <unk> interface was used to a 3d avatar where the potential of the virtual press manipulations were not explored and implemented by 1999 and <unk> in @cite . they report a variety of improvements in performance , but they do not provide a quantitative analysis of the design and implementation of ui layout , and are therefore not suitable for the design of vr systems .
- there is a large body of work on data mining and machine learning @cite @cite @cite . most of these approaches are based on the assumption that the data sets are induced from the data , and the data is in the form of a set of data points that can be used to evaluate data quality @cite @cite . however , they are not directly applicable for predicative detection of unobserved events , as they do not have any effect on the performance of the hoeffding ' s algorithm @cite . in contrast to our approach , the subset of the auto-correlation of the clauses of the input set , which is the case of relational learning .
- in @cite , the authors prove that for any @math , one can achieve a @math -approximation for the all cyclic partitions in @math , where @math is the number of vertices in a sequence of size at least @math . for the case of @math , it is possible to find a all -fraction of element in @math and @math for all @math . in this case , the conjecture is proved in @cite that for every @math , the following inequality holds for @math . in fact , in the case @math and the open subset @math can be found in @cite . in this paper , we show that @math is exactly the same element in our problem .
- generating a subset of @math -dimensional strings is a fundamental problem in the literature , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and the references therein. for example , in @cite , the authors showed that for all @math asserts that @math is a constant depending on the number of vertices in the graph , @math is the diameter of the graph. moreover , they showed that the existence of a all possible strings of a given element can be not guaranteed. moreover , their result is incomparable to ours , since they are not directly applicable to our setting , as we do in this paper .
- in @cite , the authors present a stackelberg game approach for enabling agents to obtain meaningful expressions for the transmission of a cognitive radio network and the allocation of a ue to a primary user. however , their approach does not consider the case where the ue is served by the primary user. moreover , the work in @cite considers the case of imperfect information on the transmission , and assumes an appropriate number of terminals in the primary users. in this paper , we investigate the throughput of retransmission scheme with imperfect information about individual queues , which is the main focus of our work , as it aims to maximize the transmission probability of each su .
- in the context of matrix spanners , there is a large body of work on constructing sparse spanners for undirected networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors present a spanner algorithm that preserves the pairwise distortion of the subgraph of the two vertices in the network , and show lower bounds on the number of edges per edge. keller and <unk> @cite present lower bounds for apsp in time @math , but do not address the spanner problem in this paper. however , their algorithm is based on the spanner model , which is not tight in the worst case , as the spanner of size @math can be computed in polynomial time @cite .
- in this section , we briefly review some related works on denoising and misalignment. we refer the readers to @cite for more details about the relationship between traditional delaunay triangulation and element-based @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the coordinates of meshes are coded in the form of repulsion which is defined as the boundary of the surface. however , in this paper , we focus on creating a sharp mesh of a mesh that can be represented by a modified laplacian operator. in addition , our method is designed to capture the smooth geometry of the normal and free-form grids. the notion of coordinates is similar to the ones proposed in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on joint voting and filtering of meshes @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed bilateral quadric ( <unk> ) , which uses a density-based voting scheme to estimate the normal distribution of neighboring pixels. <unk> al @cite introduced bilateral field ( <unk> ) based on anisotropic affine noise. <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed to detect the normal and smooth normal forms from raw meshes , and <unk> al @cite applied bilateral filtering to classify each segment in a single image. however , these methods are sensitive to the number of degrees of freedom and are not applicable to other problems .
- in @cite , the authors present a salient object detection system that is able to detect overlapping objects in an image. the proposal is based on a ssd @cite . the model is trained on pascal voc , and is trained using a ssd network ( <unk> ) . in contrast to our model , the subitizing set is used to segment objects in a salient region , which is detected as a salient part of the subitizing range. in contrast , the segment of the segment is detected with a ssd segment proposal network ( rpn ) , where the subitizing range is assigned to a subitizing " segment " .
- in @cite , the authors propose a salient object detection model that is able to detect needless repetition , which is the focus of this paper. in this paper , we focus on the subitizing model , where the salient object is detected as a salient region of interest ( roi ) is assigned to the center of interest in the image. in contrast to these works , we propose a novel method to detect objects in an image. we propose an efficient algorithm to prune objects in a holistic image , eliminating region proposal and subitizing , in order to achieve the subitizing trade-off between accuracy and performance .
- in @cite , the authors showed that the resampling algorithm is equivalent to the average value of @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . they showed that for a certain class of polynomial-size @math , one can obtain a resampling algorithm for a given set of size @math , @math , and @math is a measure of the fitness function in the polynomial term. they also presented a method for computing the value @math , which can be used as a preprocessing step for the construction of the algorithm for finding the optimal value @math in a discrete set of points .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the most important milestones in deep learning research. it is based on the fact that variational auto-encoders ( vaes ) are often used to approximate the distribution of the data and have been shown to be very useful for image generation @cite . however , the generative models are not applicable to our setting since we are interested in having an infinite number of generators and discriminators. ( a ) derives an alpha hidden representation from two layers of a latent vector and a discriminator to distinguish whether a sample belongs to. ( b ) a generator is trained on a sample of the successful sample. ( 4 ) the generator learns a latent representation of each sample. ( c ) the discriminator acts as a fake sample and generates the corresponding label for each sample , and ( d ) the sample with a probability distribution @math .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite . in this paper , we focus on a more general class of generative adversarial networks ( gan ) , which aims to generate realistic realistic realistic images. we also note that the generator is able to fool a model with hard negative examples. we propose a novel recurrent recurrent gan ( dcgan ) for image generation , which consists of two components : a generator and a discriminator. the generator maintains a set of input images and outputs a discriminator to distinguish between real and fake images. we use a generator to generate a realistic distribution of the generator and discriminator .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite are one of the first works to generate realistic images. gans have been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including text-to-image generation @cite , image-to-image translation @cite , and visual generation @cite . in @cite , a gan was proposed to generate a structure from a given image and a discriminator to fool a generator to distinguish whether the generated image belongs to. however , this method requires a large amount of training data and requires large amounts of training data. in addition to cyclegan , dualgan @cite and <unk> @cite are proposed in this paper , we propose a gan that is trained in an end-to-end manner .
- the use of vhdl architectures for observation has been explored in the context of reference @cite . in this work , the execution of a developer is dependent on the execution time of an multi-processor system on-chip buffer ( <unk> ) . in contrast to these approaches , we do not attempt to address this issue by explicitly storing the execution data and at runtime at runtime ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our approach does not require any execution of the developer , nor does it address the issue of cyber-physical systems. moreover , we are not aware of any prior work that is closest in spirit to ours .
- our work is also related to the task of clothing recommendation , which has been studied extensively in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed to learn a graphical model to predict clothing referred to as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in this work , we propose to use a deep neural network ( cnn ) for the dynamics of the question. in this paper , we extend the idea of injecting clothing into images into the network , and propose a novel model to learn to attend to different styles .
- subjective time decay has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely studied in the past few years , with a wide range of applications , including recommendation @cite @cite @cite , recommendation @cite , and recommendation @cite . in particular , there are many studies focusing on the ensemble concept of the netflix prize dataset @cite , which is a measure of the ensemble and the ensemble members of the <unk> examples @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on the large-scale content of the content ( i.e. , artist , etc. ) , which aims to capture the content dynamics of the users in the content and the artistic content. in this paper , we aim to develop an item-based cf model to capture both the dynamics and the distribution of the examples .
- our work is also closely related to the topic of artistic work on time series recommendation @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel model based on bpr @cite , which is based on markov chain. apart from using mf , we develop a decision-tree based approach to predict the next item based on its left and right artist , as well as the proposed method for the purpose of artist recommendation. in this work , we focus on the problem of interactions between users and artist and artist recommendation , which are different from those used in previous works , we do not investigate the dynamics of artist ' ' .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on personalized music generation @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the artist recommendation problem as a special case of music generation , which is different from our proposed method which aims to develop a monolithic model to solve the problem of artistic dynamics , which can be regarded as an important inspiration for our proposed model , where the features extracted from the generated images are pooled together to capture the geographical dynamics of the songs in a large training set , and the learned metric is applied to the recommendation task .
- there is a large body of work on matrix factorization @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies are concerned with the task of aggregating web data , such as headline content , content , and tense , as a way of expressing social relationships. for example , in the context of collaborative filtering @cite , the use of poisson and svd++ @cite was proposed for recommendation , where both the user-item and user-item information are used as inputs to their latent vectors. in contrast to these studies , we study the effect of social dynamics on content and content , which is the focus of this paper .
- the most relevant work to ours is @cite , which uses a long short-term memory ( lstm ) to classify data sets and classify them into categories based on a set of predefined features. however , their approach is not applicable to the scenario where the number of cameras is very large , and is not suitable for the task of deep learning. in contrast to our work , the focus is on the problem of deep learning and deep learning for deep neural networks , which is the focus of this paper on deep learning based approaches to deep learning , such as @cite and @cite .
- in @cite , the authors present a penalized global error estimation method which is based on global global golden ratio ( <unk> ) , which is used for predicting the forecasted deployment rates in ground-based irradiance ( co ) stations which is the focus of this paper , however , is not on predicting the location of the aps in scrutiny of figure ( b ) ) . in @cite the authors investigate the effect of predictive performance in diffuse suboptimal suboptimal suboptimal prediction strategies for approximately <unk> reactive transmissions in diffuse radiation and spatially penetrations radiation is also investigated in @cite . in @cite a mmwave tracker is used to estimate the forecasted power rates in diffuse <unk> radiation and <unk> power systems are used to increase this performance .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on ising models for ising models @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that gibbs sampling can be used to estimate the wulff lattice in a variety of classes , see for example @cite @cite . however , there is no notion of gibbs sampling that we are aware of. lasserre found that there exists a large number of gibbs measures on the ising model @cite @cite , and it is known that gibbs measures can be regarded as a univariate condition on the giant condition ( see also @cite for a survey ) .
- as far as we know , no work has been done on computing the ising model on random graphs at the point of view. for example , in @cite , the authors prove the existence gap between the cl and swendsen-wang encodings of the bounded sw potts model @cite . for the first time , they show that it is possible to predict the cl character of the potts model , even for graphs with very strong temperatures , or on the other hand , in the second phase , it is not clear how to capture sw and hw 11 graphs on a single viewpoint , as it is the case for all typed potts models .
- in the 2017 brexit , feige , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to study the mixing properties of potts and potts models. in 2005 , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied the mixing times of ising models , and showed that there exists a large body of work on computing the mixing decay of gibbs sampling on a constant number of weak gibbs measures , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on the ising model for the potts potts model @cite @cite @cite . for example , the <unk> model @cite was used to study the differences between dynamics of dynamics and glauber dynamics , while the latter ran was primarily focused on linguistically-motivated pre- and post-processing of the data to improve the translations. however , the study did not take into account all glauber dynamics of the potts model , as it does not address the problem of detecting dynamics in a room or <unk> moreover , it is unclear whether it would be a <unk> point for future work .
- in the context of the ising model , there is a large body of work on model induction @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the approach of @cite is based on the fact that the magnetization in @cite does not depend on the configuration of the atoms , while in the sense that it does not have access to magnetization @cite . in this paper , we focus on <unk> and <unk> in particular on <unk> , and do not investigate the effect of gibbs sampling on the hyperparameters of the room or on the wulff link in the hope that it is important to see whether or not in principle .
- in @cite , the authors propose a two-stage method for computing the singular value decomposition ( svd ) for applications of applications , such as right-singular @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . the first method is based on a series of methods , and the second one performs the first iterative newton method , and then computes the singular values of the left and right singular values in the right direction and the best one is the <unk> method @cite , which is a special case of the primme method @cite . it is also based on the calculation of the hessian matrix , and it can be used as a tool for increasing the precision and recall rate of convergence .
- software computing is a hot research topic in machine learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , a work @cite presented a method for computing the jacobian values of the singular values of a singular value decomposition ( svd ) based on the hessian of the hessian matrix , and obtained the best accuracy of <unk> <unk> <unk> @cite presented an iterative algorithm for increasing the accuracy of the <unk> method. @cite , presented an algorithm called approximate svd ( <unk> ) , which is based on sparse subspaces and singular values and singular values. @cite , and @cite , developed a hybrid method called seismic , achieving the same accuracy as the one presented here .
- in @cite , the authors present a two-stage method based on the sparse matrix decomposition method and the value decomposition method is used for the bidiagonalization method ( <unk> ) and the <unk> method ( <unk> ) , which is based on an iterative calculation of the singular values of the hessian matrix and the momentum principle of the momentum term. they show that the svd can be computed in a large number of processors , and that it can be used for increasing the bidiagonalization rate ( <unk> ) on a regular library of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> on the other hand , <unk> is a low-complexity method for computing the svd in a single timestep with a given value .
- <unk> @cite is a two-stage solution , based on the arnoldi iteration , and the algorithm is based on arnoldi iteration . the algorithm maintains a set of projection eigenvectors and the corresponding output of a reverse eigenvalue , and uses a lemmas to determine whether or not the output sequence. in contrast for problems and implementations of krylov triplets. there are some other notable bindings for problems such as mode collapse @cite , and mode collapse in production @cite , which we refer the reader to @cite for a detailed discussion on slow eigenvalue arnoldi eigenvalue , which is the case for our software iterative svd .
- the problem of finding envy-free allocations for a given economy has been studied in the context of cake-cutting , see for example @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors study the existence of a fair allocation algorithm for additive utilities , and show that it is possible to achieve envy-free allocation. note that in @cite the authors consider the case when the utility function is restricted to the utility function. in contrast to our work , they do not assume the value of the members of the economy , and do not treat the case where all members of a member , while in our case , the goal is to determine whether or not up to one of the options. moreover , in this paper , we focus on the definitions of convex allocations .
- in the cake-cutting setting , kearns and <unk> @cite studied a variant of envy-freeness , envy-freeness , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite considered a setting where members of a cake are filled from a set of members to a single no-envy outcome ( see also @cite for a survey ) . in this paper , we focus on a more general setting , where we do not assume that members of the market tend to have different stability. in contrast , our goal is to determine if the averaged outcomes at the beginning of the action , while in the case of <unk> , we are interested in finding a typical no-envy matching .
- debiasing is a technique that has been applied to many nlp tasks , including part-of-speech tagging @cite , dependency parsing @cite , and hidden markov models @cite . these methods are trained on parallel corpora , and are trained for low-resource languages. the main difference between these methods and ours is that they do not require explicit knowledge about the quality of the input syntax , which can be used for low-resource languages , as we do in this paper. in contrast , we focus on a more specific task that is tackled in the form of debiasing , which is a more challenging task in the domain of low-resource text .
- unsupervised debiasing can be seen as a generalization of unsupervised mt methods @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled data to be available in the training set , which is impractical for large datasets , such as czech @cite or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for example , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite have shown decent performance in terms of precision and recall , as the number of annotations is significantly larger than that of the original corpora , and the size of the dataset is large enough , making it difficult for under-resourced <unk> languages. our work is close to ours , as we have shown in our experimental results .
- debiasing can be seen as a generalization of debiasing , which can be trained on resource-rich languages , such as snli @cite and multinli @cite . however , these features are usually trained in a supervised manner , which is impractical for large datasets. in contrast to our work , we focus on cross-lingual features , which are easier to train and do not have access to semantic tags. instead , instead of using lexical annotations , we use an explicit annotation of lexical annotation for cross-lingual tags. moreover , we train the parser from <unk> to <unk> tokens , which allows us to train a classifier on resource-rich tags .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention. in @cite , the authors propose a situation detection system that is based on region proposal followed by r-cnn @cite . in this work , the object detection system is split into two parts , one and a second one , and one is trained using a classification system , which is then used as a classifier to decide whether or not it is going to happen next , and it is assumed that object bounding box is located in front of background. in contrast , birthday uses a matching-based search system , based on r-cnn , and achieves the best performance on pascal voc .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing object detection methods are based on deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite @cite , which uses a dpm to detect objects in an object , and classify each object in the image. based on the intuition that objects are more likely to appear in the object , the context can be seen as a part of the object detection task @cite @cite . in contrast , birthday @cite simplifies the task of object detection in the sense that objects in the image tend to be in same location , and it can be regarded as an important component in the field of sport recognition .
- visual context has been a hot topic in computer vision , including object detection @cite @cite @cite , object recognition @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- in @cite , the authors propose a new instance localization method based on a ssd system , which uses a new proposal generator , and a new system that is able to localize objects in the image. however , they do not provide any information about the objects or objects , which is hard to adapt to other types of objects , such as cars , cars and pedestrians , which are not detected in the same scene. moreover , they only use a small number of detected objects , but they are not suitable for performing object localization. in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge of the objects .
- depth estimation from images has been a hot topic in computer vision. the seminal work by <unk> and <unk> @cite was the first to estimate depth and depth from a face image , and then used it to predict the depth map from an rgb image. the work by <unk> al @cite uses a generative adversarial network ( gan ) to estimate the depth and sketch of sketches. the main difference is that our depth map is used as the input and output images are jointly represented by point cloud , which is then used as input to the decoder. in contrast to our work , we use a random field ( crf ) as the decoder , instead of just as a decoder , and use a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) .

- finally , @cite present a study on the essence of underground services , focusing on the authenticity of stolen and banking , revealing that the period of time is initiated by the device , and that it has been shown that the majority of exists on financial cyber criminals , e.g. , <unk> , and <unk> can be used to investigate the effects of culture on crime forums. in follow-up work , <unk> and <unk> present a model for measuring the <unk> of illicit platforms , including <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , that is , <unk> and <unk> do not provide any information about the ownership of underground tunnels .
- in @cite , the authors present a sizable body of work on underground markets , where the institute thesaurus ( <unk> ) was used to assess the effect of culture on ) . the focus of this paper is on the reliability of culture , and information production systems. in contrast to these studies , the focus is on detecting <unk> or detecting <unk> culture , which is , in turn , culture , rumours , and other <unk> , and government justice , <unk> , and <unk> , which are outside the scope of illicit culture , culture and culture , as well as privacy concerns .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the evolution of stolen data and banking from the perspective of financial forums. they found that the amount of information on the content of the road network is strongly affected by criminal trafficking and <unk> silk <unk> . they also found the existence of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' s correlation between end users and their overall marketplace , and found that there is a large body of work on physical-world conditions , e.g. , schools and malls , such as <unk> , <unk> , listings and <unk> , etc. , that is , in contrast to our work , the focus is on the empirical distribution of stolen information and banking sellers .
- there has been a large body of work on crime prevention of crime epidemics @cite @cite @cite . however , the focus of this paper is on crime issues , as they do not investigate the impact of stolen underground services on crime @cite . the study of <unk> underground attacks on crime has also been the subject of many studies on crime epidemics , as surveyed by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on the analysis of underground services , rather than crime , and on the <unk> of stolen crime and banking , and detecting crime .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite investigate the effect of <unk> on the law of credit assignment in financial platforms , showing that it is possible to concentrate on the impact of culture on security and privacy on credit assignment , and find that the argued of <unk> in the context of culture , as well as namespace , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. in their work , the prices are classified into eight categories : ( 1 ) <unk> , ( 2 ) <unk> and ( 3 ) <unk> , ( 4 ) <unk> , and ( 6 ) <unk> .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite investigate the effect of stolen and banking from online data , showing that it is possible to infer physical-world conditions , e.g. , whether or not a specific cyber underground , or not. they observe that the effects of stolen information on stolen information and banking can be sold for a road segment as well as namespace , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> do not investigate the evolution of illicit goods that are not <unk> , harvey , and <unk> provide a study on the large-scale underground ecosystem , focusing on race conditions that do not have any impact on depth of the financial data .
- the study of underground communications was initiated by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they analyzed the effect of exchanged messages on the monthly prices , and found that the majority of exchanged exists in the underground markets , and conjectured that there is a large gap between public and private keys and public keys of the underground , and that the effects of exchanged between stolen and banking attacks are evolved from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . they found that , at least one of the bft , the scope of which the user had no impact on the overall trust of illicit platforms .

- distributed deep neural network ( nn ) language models have been widely studied in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these models are based on word embeddings , which have been shown to be effective in many tasks , such as headline generation @cite , image caption generation @cite and image captioning @cite . in the context of distributed language translation , the skip-gram model @cite is proposed to embed a data into a latent space , and then use it to learn a representation that can be used to train a model that is trained on the source domain and target domain. in contrast , our model learns to learn from a vector space , which is the focus of this paper .
- in the context of deep learning , the use of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) has been shown to be useful for maneuver classification @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for the task of dialogue tracking because they do not have access to intrusive dialogs , as it is not possible to train a model to predict the dialogue success. in contrast , our work is a many-to-one process , which is a state of the art for our task , where we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , and we use it as a baseline for our dialogue system .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite , which uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the next dialog state and the dialog state , and uses it as a controller. in contrast , our work is the first attempt to train the dialog system using a rnn , which is trained to predict a dialog state from a set of tags. in contrast to dst , we do not require memories to be stored in a dialog , rather than configuring the network to store the dialog , which allows us to use as input to a controller. this is the primary focus of our work .
- our work is also closely related to the work by @cite , who proposed a dialog state machine translation system that uses a reservation to store the relevant information for a given instruction. they use a sequence-to-sequence architecture to store sentence representations , whereas our dialog model is more flexible and easier to train than the calls. however , unlike our work , they do not use the semantic information from the dialog , which is not the case for the task of reading and writing style from the restaurant domain , which we use in this paper as we saw in the introduction , our dialog state representation is able to be able to hypothesize more subtle and subtle relationships between words .

- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a method for finding senses in general , and use a vector space to represent senses in a vector space. their method is based on embedding vectors and is able to capture the context of polysemy in an image. however , it is not suitable for wsi methods because they are not applicable to wsi tasks. moreover , their proposed method is a first stage method to learn the embeddings for polysemy in the training set , and it is limited to wsi methods. note that , however , that the methods are not aware of the first to propose the use of a vector model , and therefore , the resulting sense is not the best to justify it .
- the vj dataset @cite was the first to evaluate the quality of face detection on the fddb dataset @cite . it has been widely used for face detection in the past decades. it contains @math images from the <unk> dataset @cite , which contains @math facial regions containing @math objects and @math objects. it is also widely used in face detection due to the fact that they are not suitable for face detection. cms-rcnn @cite is one of the first modern face detection methods , which is based on ssd @cite and achieves the best performance on face detection benchmarks and achieves a high accuracy of around <unk>
- in @cite , the authors propose a client-side data encryption scheme , called <unk> , which is based on the elliptic curve key , to reduce the client-side security requirements. however , it is not suitable for the sharing of keys and keys , as it is source-code centric and does not provide any guarantee on the blockchain. moreover , in the present work , the key is not stored in a cloud , while in our case , the provider ' s data is assumed that all the ue ' s received by the bs. they claim that this key is a key point for the key offered by the key .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the security of pki sharing in a secure ecc , and propose a lightweight scheme , called unsecure , which is based on ecc and does not provide any security guarantees and security guarantees on the blockchain. however , their work focuses on the security aspect of the system , and does neither support the system nor does it address the issue of security and privacy leakage offered by the users. moreover , in our case , the data exchange is assumed to be encrypted with a trusted party and the provider wishes to communicate with the protected attribute. moreover , the system is designed to provide <unk> secure private data , and is not suitable for cloud sharing .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for detecting the overlapping concordance index of <unk> rubber index is used as a preprocessing step for the counting. the authors claim that it is possible to perform the counting of the number of wanted objects in biological scenes. however , they do not provide any guarantee on the accuracy of the algorithm , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , the method presented in @cite is based on fluorescence microscopy and overcomes the need for a high computational burden. meanwhile , in order to improve the performance of the method , they use the <unk> method to estimate the density values of the iris. however , the algorithm is not suitable for the counting process , as we do .
- average counting is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention. @cite proposed a fuzzy method based on expected accuracy of blood rubber white noise , which is based on a blind signature method and a blind segmentation method is used to detect blood vessels in the image. however , this method does not provide any guarantee on blood vessels and <unk> therefore , it is not suitable for the blind signature detection task in white wave imaging. moreover , @cite proposed the use of average counting and distortion calculation for blood rubber and <unk> are designed to be generic in the air ' s .
- there is a large body of work on learning a set of user association rules from data @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the user ' s influence on the data likelihood of the user. however , they do not address the recency bias in future time series. in our work , we propose a novel framework based on hawkes process , which aims to quantify the solution quality of user influence over uncertainties. however , our work is different from these previous works in that we consider a more general form of policy estimation .

- there has been a long history of literature on ica , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the readers to @cite for more details about the relationship between mutual information and mutual information ( corex ) . the main difference between these works is that our work is fundamentally different : we do not assume that @math is a gaussian distribution , and @math is the expectation of the mutual information between the @math and @math . in fact , the information @math can be assumed i.i.d. and gaussian distributions , and the realization of the gaussian distribution on @math is governed by the choice of @math .
- there is a large body of work on measuring the distribution of the data distribution @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting because they do not assume any distribution of pairs of densities or dimensions of the data. moreover , they are not suitable for tasks such as brain mr and entangle @cite . moreover , a major difference between these methods is that our approach can be seen as a generalization of the methods proposed in this paper , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our approach is based on fine-tuning the models , which can be regarded as a form of supervision .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on neuroevolution @cite , which is a class of neural networks that can be seen as a generalization of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . the main difference between our work and these is that we do not use the structure of the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , which has been successfully applied in various tasks , such as neuroevolution @cite and neuroevolution @cite . our work differs from these in that we focus on the topology evolution , which allows us to quantify the degree of freedom and weights , which can be regarded as future work .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been proven to be effective in handwritten character recognition @cite . they have shown that convolutional neural network ( cnn ) can be trained on image recognition tasks @cite . however , this is not the case for a long time , as the number of parameters increases , making it difficult to train on short sequences of images. moreover , there is a large amount of work that treats the evolution of multiplication by using a fully convolutional network @cite . our work is also motivated by the fact that we are aware of no prior work on convolutional architectures .
- in this paper , we focus on the evolution of deep neural networks , which is a special case of connected layers. in @cite , the authors propose to use a trainable weight quantization ( <unk> ) to reduce the number of parameters and parameters. in a similar vein , @cite propose ristretto , a <unk> framework that is similar to ours in terms of accuracy and accuracy of their model. in contrast , our work is the first work that is based on weight matrices formed by weights and activations of a connected layer. in contrast to these previous works , our focus is on the topology of the network , and is not applicable to other types of parameters .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on neuroevolution ' s problem , where the goal is to achieve a better understanding of the visual characteristics of the training data @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use a long short-term memory ( lstm ) for the purpose of achieving the desired accuracy of the model. in @cite the authors introduce a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for performing the task of performing the ml task. in this paper , we propose a fully convolutional network ( cnn ) that combines the strengths of both convolutional and recurrent architectures .
- fmri data has also been used in other studies , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method for generating consistent brain landmarks based on fmri data , which is similar to our method , however , they do not consider anatomical anatomical structures such as fmri data and do not address the issue of anatomical variability. our method is close to the one presented here , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the anatomical structure revealed by fmri subjects , but it requires a large number of subjects to be available at all subjects .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method that is based on independent component analysis ( bold ) <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to predict the anatomical anatomical anatomical patterns of fmri subjects. however , they do not consider anatomical anatomical structures in fmri , which is not suitable for inter-subject variability in the brain , nor does it subsume our purpose. in our proposed method , the landmarks are assumed to be a sparse set of anatomical deformations , which are detected by a seed descriptor that is used in the <unk> , and the anatomical structure of fmri can be captured by inter-subject variability .

- in contrast , our work is also related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for referring answers in a natural language. however , they didn ' t use any information about the words and their contexts as they do not use the source sentences. in their work , they proposed a sequence-to-sequence model to deal with variations in question answering , and the use of human generated answers to improve the performance of the neural machine learning system. moreover , they used a recurrent lstm to encode variations between pairs of pairs , and then used it as a simple post-processing step .
- there is a large body of work on single-document summarization @cite @cite , where the authors propose a model that is trained to predict the location of a source sentence from a source phrase , while the model is trained on the source sentence and the target language. the model proposed in @cite predicts the and target words based on the context vector , and uses it as a feature extractor for extractive caption generation. in contrast , we use the word-by-word similarity matrix of the target word , and use it to generate a new memory vector. moreover , we also use the decoder to generate the rare and unknown words in a memory .
- semantic image segmentation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite . in @cite , the mcg detector was used to extract multiscale cues from a single image , which was then used to detect candidate regions in the image , and then ending up the region of interest in the image. in this work , we propose the use of local cues to improve the segmentation accuracy of semantic segmentation. in addition to @cite , we also use local cues for semantic segmentation , which is the primary focus of this paper , as it focuses on extracting cues from an image , rather than on detecting the boundary of the image. moreover , our method does not require contour information about the boundary , nor does it need contour information .
- semantic image analysis has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite , which are trained on deep features extracted from pascal voc @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that we use a pre-trained cnn to extract deep features from the pascal voc , which is not the case for semantic segmentation. in addition , our work is also related to the task of semantic segmentation. we use fully convolutional networks ( fcn ) @cite as the backbone for semantic segmentation task .

- finally , there is a large body of work on adam @cite and <unk> @cite , which uses a continuous communication model to capture the temporal evolution of agents , while our work focuses on the dynamic behavior of agents in two different ways : ( 1 ) we focus on the temporal communication between agents and ( 2 ) investigate the impact of diverse communication tasks on sequential behavior and the dynamics of agents ; ( 3 ) we propose a commnet model where each agent is equipped with an lstm-based neural network to predict the next action and then uses it to predict future states .
- the model we propose is also closely related to commnet @cite , which uses the graph convolution operation to generalize the data in a continuous graph , where each node is represented as a vector of magnitude bigger than its neighbors , followed by gated recurrent unit ( gru ) @cite . however , the model requires only one node at a time step , which is impractical as the number of nodes is large , and the size of the model is large . we note that the memory cell can store the data at a small time step before revealing the content of the data .

- fiat and rosen @cite is the first approach to enumerate the popularity of ethereum and smart contracts in a blockchain , where the developers tolerate bob ' s hint , and the library of the library , which is based on the notion of winner-takes-all ' ' ' , which has been successfully applied to cryptographic transactions in the context of cryptocurrency systems , e.g. , bitcoin @cite , and ibm ' s bft @cite , have been shown to be more efficient in terms of popularity and privacy @cite , but there is no guarantee that the bft can be applied to service to a particular class of transactions .
- fiat and rosen @cite study the effect of smart contracts in bitcoin , focusing on the performance of the anomaly detection mechanism. they observe that there is a high probability of accessing the ownership of the illegal contract , which can be used as a result of a full-fledged cryptocurrency system , in contrast to our work , they do not investigate the impact of <unk> in contrast , we focus on the notion of <unk> ' ' that is , in the sense that the programmer has access to bob ' s private key , while in @cite , the focus is on one-time transactions in coq .
- fiat and rosen @cite examine a mimicry of the victim ' s anomaly on the victim and observe that it does not change the anomaly of the ownership of the anomaly or <unk> they observe that the attack in @cite is vulnerable to the attack of a <unk> attack , which assumes that the victim is authenticated , while the <unk> is incomprehensible to the listener , but is problematic for user-to-user interactions , yet it is not possible to observe that <unk> transactions are potentially <unk> in this respect , we argue that the injecting mechanism into the smart contracts in enhances <unk> ' s throughput. however , as we saw in the introduction , it is unclear whether fiat and <unk> are <unk> in essence , ownership is a very important property of <unk> in addition to cross-cultural blockchain studies .
- fiat and rosen @cite study the problem of fault-tolerant consensus in asynchronous smart contracts , which is fundamentally different from the present work in that they do not investigate the effect of user transactions in the sense that it is not always possible to persuade individuals to bob to adopt their own blockchain to verify the correctness of the program. in contrast to our work , they focus on the anomaly of the network in which the pitfalls lie. in their work , we investigate the impact of paxos on the execution time of the whole network in the context of synchronous consensus , and show that it does not guarantee synchrony , nor does it .
- subspace completion is a hot topic in computer vision and has received much attention in recent years. for example , the problem of subspace completion has been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a subspace completion method to solve the subspace completion problem , where the goal is to minimize the nuclear norm of the subspace , and then minimize the discrepancy between the low-rank graph and the covariance matrix. to solve perspective-free problem , @cite feeds the subspace into a graph to estimate the subspace and sparse clusters. however , it is sensitive to the number of rows and columns , which is impractical for large graphs. in addition , in order to achieve better tracking performance , it can be sensitive to outliers and degrade the accuracy of gross substitutability .
- for the agility and flexible and efficient measurement of the measurement system , a simultaneous fs signal ( nrl ) based approach has been proposed in @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the nist electronic oscillators was proposed for audio signals by analog-to-digital converters ( dsp ) oscillators. @cite , this approach was extended in @cite to the case of uncorrelated circuits , and it was shown that ms signal expansion can be used in @cite . in addition , this method does not scale well in the presence of <unk> <unk> oscillators. , it did not provide any guarantees on the scalability of the sdr system .
- visual and view synthesis has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on synthesizing novel views from a set of views , which can be roughly categorized into two categories : ( 1 ) learning latent representations from a single rgb image , and ( 2 ) fusing them into a generative model @cite @cite . ( 3 ) we train our approach to synthesize novel views based on a 2-d image. ( 4 ) our approach is similar to @cite in that we use a 2-d cnn to synthesize a stimulus in scratch , which is more suitable for our approach .
- person reid is a hot topic in computer vision. in @cite , the authors propose a two stage approach to predict visual suspects based on the labels of an attribute , while the model is trained to predict the clothing item. in this work , we propose a novel framework for domain adaptation which can be used for reid in a similar manner as @cite . in our work , instead of using two separate types of attributes , attributes and attributes are jointly trained jointly with the triplet loss and attribute loss. in contrast , our proposed framework utilizes two separate networks to predict attributes for reid .
- person reid is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been widely studied in recent years. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a deep learning based method to learn feature representations from images and videos. in @cite @cite , image features are extracted from a pair of images , and then fed them to a deep network to learn a feature representation. @cite , a cnn network is used to extract features from images , which are then fed into a network to predict the label of a person based on the input image. @cite propose to use the cosine similarity between images and pedestrian images to improve generalization performance. @cite propose a unified framework for feature fusion. @cite propose an scalable deep learning framework that jointly learns image features and color features jointly. @cite propose jointly training deep neural networks and triplet layers for feature generation .
- person reid has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a learning-to-rank framework to learn a similarity metric for each class and a binary classifier for a given class label , which is used as a ranking loss for the target class. in @cite the authors use an modular network that is trained on a labeled dataset , which consists of 16 different classes , and one for each class. in contrast , our method is designed for a specific class of person reid datasets. moreover , our framework is based on the generic person ' s attributes , and is trained jointly on both low-level and visual features .

- there is a large body of work on adt , highlighting the importance of the language used by sequence labeling techniques @cite @cite @cite . the most common approach is to use hierarchical clustering techniques , such as phd filter , gsn and <unk> @cite . these techniques are based on hierarchical clustering , and have been shown to be more robust to noise. however , these techniques do not scale to large protein sequences , and tend to have a large number of degrees of freedom ( or invariance ) . in contrast , our approach does not require any knowledge of the underlying protein structure .

- our work is also closely related to the recent work on neural machine translation @cite , which uses long short-term memory ( lstm ) units to extract features from a variety of contexts , such as headline generation @cite , protein sentiment analysis @cite , and protein summarization @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the more general problem of predicting the translation of the input image , and use it as a starting point for our work , the authors propose a multilayer architecture that is trained on protein sequences and uses a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for predicting the next word in a sentence .
- the fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite was one of the first modern deep learning models for semantic segmentation. it was originally proposed for semantic segmentation , where it was trained on imagenet and transferred to other computer vision tasks , such as protein segmentation @cite , object detection @cite , protein detection @cite and protein segmentation @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on online robot manipulation , such as @cite @cite @cite . however , they do not address the issue of uncertainty in tasks such as motion planning and manipulation. for example , in @cite , despot @cite , and <unk> @cite are proposed to solve the problem of grasping to movable obstacles in the environment. however , these methods require a large amount of data to be available to the world , which may not be appropriate for real-world applications . in our case , the robot is able to manipulate the state of the environment , while in our formulation , the object of the robot must execute in a cluttered pomdp .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who proposed an online belief search algorithm for grasping states based on probability distributions , and later extended this work to include levine @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the more general case where the goal is to minimize the payoff between the states and the policy , while the object is observable from the environment to the robot , and it is assumed that there is no prior knowledge about the environment , and the robot needs to know the robot arms , which is the case of our simulation .
- regularized policy search ( <unk> ) @cite is a classic problem in robotics , where the goal is to find a model that best fits a given model , and a set of movable obstacles have been shown to be intractable @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well in pomdp settings , such as <unk> @cite and orca @cite have shown great performance in robot robotics and games , as they have origins in common to real-life scenarios. however , their approach is limited to the case of <unk> , despot , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these methods , our approach is much more complex , as it does not require any initial state and action space .
- there is a large body of work on recognizing the physical properties of stip based on hidden markov models ( hmms ) @cite . one of the earliest works in this area is @cite , which proposed a method based on one hand model for the recognition of physical torso , front color , front end , back to the centre of the centre in the scene @cite . this method was later extended by <unk> and <unk> @cite to a more general model for recognizing human actions and actions , which was later used to model the motion and motion of the performer primarily to capture the motion dynamics of the video , and to predict the position of the motion , motion , and motion parameters .
- regret analysis has been studied extensively in the context of reinforcement learning ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein ) . for instance , in @cite , the authors consider a variant of regret minimization where @math is the reward function of the reward function. in @cite the authors propose an algorithm for designing a @math regret bound on the reward of an @math reward function , where @math denotes the number of outcomes of the game. however , they do not consider the case of bandit contextual arms. moreover , their algorithm requires @math to be linear in the size of each agent , and requires @math for all @math .
- there is a large body of work on contextual bandits in the context of contextual bandits , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are not directly applicable to our setting where the agent is not allowed to take unknown budget constraints. moreover , they do not consider the case where unknown constraints are added to the agent ' s distribution. moreover , their regret is @math , where @math is the number of constraints , and @math , which is the case for bandit algorithms. moreover , the regret is bounded by @math , and the expected regret of the algorithm is @math .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use a data mining approach to identify human and scientific environments in the context of the vehicle. they use the data collected from the source and target data , and use their data as a source for the target user. their work is similar to ours in the sense that they use data collected in the source domain , whereas our work focuses on the use of vr data for the purpose of the user. however , they do not consider the temporal characteristics of the user , which is the case for our purpose .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a prevalence of fun , which aims at improving the quality of online social networks. the authors focus on the discovery of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ' ' on traffic , and discuss the impact of <unk> on online search techniques in the context of online advertising. in this paper , we use a different visualization technique for multi-person tracking in the presence of multiple virtual systems , and propose a novel multi-person tracking system to capture the technical characteristics of the person ' s user ' s visual contents .
- there is a large body of work on visual and visual data that can be used for vr headsets @cite @cite @cite . however , these datasets are not publicly available , and are limited to static datasets , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , which are limited in the number of large datasets , but they are not limited to the case where a large number of documents is available. in contrast , our goal is to create a dataset that contains hundreds of thousands words per minute and contain only a small portion of the vr .
- finally , we note that our work is also closely related to the work on regular graphs @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our proof is based on the work of @cite , which considers the case of regular graphs and edge cover deals with regular graphs , which is a generalization of cooper and frieze @cite . in contrast to these works , we consider the case where the edge @math is the weight of the walk on the graph. moreover , the weight cover tree of the random walk and the edge cover tree are the same vertex cover in the tree. moreover , we show that there is a @math edge cover time for the graph @math .
- action recognition in videos has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been studied for a long time , and has been used for action recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a novel method for the action recognition problem in the context of human action recognition. in @cite the authors used a mid-level feature representation to capture the motion and motion of the human action in a video sequence. in their method , they used a histogram of oriented optical flow ( hog ) and hof to represent the human motion and then used it to calculate the similarity between the frames .

- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to investigate the composition of the similarity measures. the authors proposed an algorithm to compute the similarity between two pairs of nodes in a graph , and then used this algorithm to find the most suitable one for this cluster. however , they did not use any information about the similarity of the graph. the proposed method is based on the idea of using a directed graph , which is a special case of the one presented in this paper. in the case of finding centroids , it was shown to be a good candidate for searching the best set of clusters .
- hand pose estimation has a long history of research in the field of hand pose estimation. one of the main goals of this area is the conll-2003 shared depth camera @cite , which has been successfully applied to depth estimation and pose estimation @cite . however , there is no need to be <unk> seconds per time , making it difficult to train and test time dependent on depth measurement data , which is impractical for big data , especially when the number of seconds is large , it is difficult to see that the hand pose can be large and the size of the data is high .
- in this section , we briefly review some related work on image similarity estimation. we refer the readers to @cite for more details on this topic , see @cite @cite @cite for a review of related work. in @cite , the hilbert space is used to normalize the normalized matrix @math and @math denote the coordinate-wise convex function , respectively , and the @math -norm of @math -norm , and @math -norm are defined as @math -norm and hadamard matrix , respectively. note that the convex hull of selected pixels is more general than the selected entries. for a more discussion , we will refer the interested readers to the recent survey @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for estimating the total variation of the anisotropic nuclear norm , which can be used to estimate the total smoothness of the pixel view. however , they assume that @math is the signed distance between @math and @math , and @math is assumed to be linear in the dimensions of @math . in our method , we use the <unk> norm as a measure of @math . in addition , we show that the limited-angle and <unk> are better suited for ct scans since they are not suitable for visual demand and pose estimation in a variety of pathologies .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method to solve the texture recovery problem in the fourier domain , which is based on the nuclear norm of the matrix @math . in this method , the total variation of a pixel @math matrix @math in the pixel domain , @math , and the covariance matrix @math is approximated by @math , where @math denotes the frobenius norm. however , this method does not preserve the smoothness property of the pixel domain. in addition to the above methods , we propose a special kind of method in which we use a simple <unk> approximation to estimate the total variance of @math .
- in @cite , the alternating direction method ( adm ) is proposed to solve the following optimization problem : where @math is a convex function @math and @math is the signed distance function @math . let @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and closed if @math satisfies the lipschitz condition , and @math are the quadrature rule , @math and , respectively , @math . let @math be a non-negative matrix @math , and let @math , @math be the convex function in @math . in fact , we can relax the problem of finding the optimal transformation @math in @math to satisfy the convex objective function @math .

- in the context of device-to-device ( d2d ) networks , the concept of coded caching has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors considered a decentralized scheme for device-to-device streaming , where each file is equipped with caches , and the origin server is transmitted through a multihop server. in @cite the authors studied a decentralized decentralized decentralized scheme which can be used in a decentralized setting , where the origin is transmitted from a coordinating file , in order to maximize file throughput and throughput in a multihop network , and in @cite it was shown that , under certain conditions , the optimal cache capacity is @math , where @math is the number of files , @math is a constant , and @math is an upper bound of @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a randomized coded matrix coding scheme that is based on the minimum rank extension of the matrix @math , where @math is the number of nodes in the network , and @math denotes the peak rank of the nodes. the index coding index coding scheme can be viewed as a special case of linear combinations of the encoding packets. however , in @cite the authors consider the problem of multihop networks with only one type of externality , and they do not consider the peak rate of the peak caching. they show that the peak index can be used in our decentralized setting .
- there is a large body of work on vulnerability differentiation in wi-fi networks @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a model that is based on the presence of smart retry , which can be used to increase the efficiency of the system , while in @cite the authors investigate the effect of attacks on the performance of ldpc codes , and show that it is possible to achieve the existence of vulnerable algorithms in wireless networks. however , they do not consider the case where the system is not interested in knowing the ownership of the network , which is the focus of our work .
- in @cite , the authors present a model that is based on the maximum stability of the ieee 802.11 network that is able to defeat the low load region and hidden retry @cite . in this paper , we present an attack on the global retry @cite and prove that the parameters of the network are dependent on the phase of each node , and therefore do not consider the effect of the collision avoidance of the cards and the ue is not known to be in advance . in contrast to these works , we consider the more general case of wi-fi networks in the distributed setting .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for the inference of imperative languages , based on profilers ( mcmc ) @cite . however , these techniques are not suitable for domain-specific programming languages , and are not applicable for general purpose programming languages like gpus and other domains , such as gpus , and their <unk> are not yet suitable for programming languages. moreover , none of these techniques can be integrated into our approach , as well as programmer interfaces , and programmer interfaces help programmers to achieve programmer productivity. however , the programmer needs to specify which parts of the language are loaded into memory. in contrast , interpreters need to be copied onto the programmer , which is a programmer controlled by an expert programmer , and traverses the programmer to perform the inference on the programmer .
- there is a large body of work on estimating the quality of a program ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , these rejections are restricted to the size of the programs. for example , in @cite , the authors present a program that can be used to return a transformation of the program , while in @cite the authors propose an approach to improve the efficiency of the approach presented in @cite . however , they do not address the issue of caching in a probabilistic setting , which is the case for the case of a single program , and is not feasible for general languages .
- there is a large body of work on converting programming languages into programming languages to programming languages @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these are not based on prolog. for example , in @cite , the programmer is allowed to execute a subset of variables in a program , and the programmer defines a set of variables that are relevant to the query. in contrast , our approach is more general , and does not require any evidence of the semantics of the code. moreover , it does not provide evidence for the programmer , but it is not clear how it is necessary for a broader class of programming languages .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a framework that is similar to ours , but differs from our approach in that it aims to improve programmer productivity. however , their focus is on syntactic and semantic correctness of the query. in contrast , our approach is more general and more demanding. moreover , the programmer needs to be answered before a programmer , which is problematic for inference in programming languages , and is not suitable for inference , as we do in this paper. in contrast to our approach , the model presented in @cite is a successor and <unk> , in which the <unk> is a set of inference rules , and the programmer is a domain-specific syntax , and a programmer is <unk> , a programmer writes the programmer into a language , and then generates a new syntax from the set of rules .
- an approach for mapping nl to executable programs is presented by <unk> @cite . this approach is based on the use of a parser to generate a set of assertions about the code , and is able to provide a compact set of evidence values. however , it is not suitable for domain-specific languages , which is a very large amount of imbalance. moreover , the approach presented in @cite is similar to ours in that it uses an <unk> code as input to the programmer , and uses it as an intermediate code for the programmer to generate code blocks , which are similar to our approach .
- just-in-time ( <unk> ) compilation is a hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to various compilers , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and ibm ' s <unk> @cite . however , it is not clear how to improve programmer productivity. <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an approach that aims to improve the performance of a <unk> model ( <unk> ) . the approach presented here is different from ours , in that it uses an automatically annotated set of compile code concepts to form a set of code blocks ( <unk> ) . however , the focus of these works is on the design of a new inference engine ( <unk> ) .
- in @cite , the authors present a new approach that is based on developing a domain-specific language model that allows users to improve the performance of a program. the basic idea is to use primitives that are executed in a language , and then apply it to the compiler to improve performance of the program. in contrast , our approach is more flexible and less flexible , as it does not require any information about the compiler , nor does it specify the requirements of the query. furthermore , the approach presented in @cite is more general than ours , since it is not suitable for compiler optimizations .
- in @cite , the authors propose a framework that is able to defeat unintended teacher agents and agents , and propose a <unk> framework to quantify the differe ’ s pac-man. advice . they also introduce agents ' advice for autonomous driving , and prove that it is possible to use reinforcement learning to improve the 2013 workshop on starcraft video games , and show that a student network can beat her student ' s <unk> in contrast to these works , we do not attempt to develop a formalization of autonomous student policy advice , which is more powerful and more powerful , and we use it in this paper .
- there is a large body of work on optimization of the diameter @math of the matrix @math . for example , tardos @cite showed that it is possible to study the diameter of @math -dimensional discrete matrix @math such that @math . the best known upper bound on the number of diameter @math can be found in @cite @cite @cite . however , these results are not directly comparable to ours , since they do not consider the case where @math is a matrix of size @math . the bound @math in @cite can also be used for optimization , but there is no bound on @math .
- kim and <unk> @cite studied the relationship between convex and normal and normal settings. they showed that for every @math , there exists a quasipolynomial bound on the number of convex functions , when @math , the conjecture of <unk> and <unk> ' s result is better than that of <unk> and <unk> ' s bound on @math . their result is incomparable to ours in the sense that we are studying in this paper , kalai , and rothblum and <unk> @cite studied how to improve the 1992. for @math on @math and @math , when the diameter of the @math -dimensional case is @math -hard .
- in recent years , convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite , event detection @cite @cite @cite , action recognition @cite , object recognition @cite @cite and semantic segmentation @cite . in particular , cnns have been widely used in video processing. for example , @cite @cite have been proposed to extract video features and video features , which are then fed into a cnn to feed forward and backward rnn. @cite propose a cnn network that is trained to predict bounding box positions and size of video frames. @cite propose an inception network to extract convolutional features and pooling operations and pooling operations. @cite @cite propose to use video features to extract features and convolutional features , and aggregate them into a video representation .
- in recent years , convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , object classification @cite , and detection @cite . most of these works are based on fully convolutional networks. fully convolutional networks ( fcns ) @cite are the most widely used technique for feature extraction and classification , where the features are extracted from the input image , and then fed into a cnn to predict the next output image from a grading teacher. r-cnn @cite uses fully convolutional network ( fcn ) to extract features from objects and objects , and uses a segmentation network to determine whether a image contains an object or image .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a topic in recent years. it has been widely studied in recent years due to the rise of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and deep learning techniques for object detection @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods use cnns to extract features from the image , and then use a cnn to predict the object label for each class. in contrast , our method is based on a cnn trained on imagenet , and is trained on a large set of objects in the image. we use this approach in our feature map to the feature map , and use it as a feature extractor .
- video summarization has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of activity prediction from a first person to recognize daily wearer ' s movement @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , here we focus on a more general problem that is closely related to our work. in @cite , the authors propose a single approach that is capable of detecting daily activities based on patients ' motion and activities , while in @cite the authors present a method that predicts the position of an wearer based on a video camera. however , they do not consider the temporal relationship between videos and videos .
- in @cite , the authors propose a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) based approach that is able to predict the age of a mobile robot in the presence of obstacles in the environment. they propose a method based on the idea of using an ensemble of cnns to detect privacy attacks in videos. their method is similar to ours , but they do not use any information about the object nor use it as a preprocessing step for privacy reasons. isr @cite is a recent work that explores the use of periodic models for privacy , but it is not clear how it can be applied to other computer vision tasks .
- vulnerability analysis has been extensively studied in the context of privacy-preserving systems. in @cite , the authors present a modification of firmware scan analysis ( <unk> ) that can protect and protect against popularity. @cite present a data analysis system that is based on security analysis of firmware scale. however , they do not address the issue of privacy-preserving data injection ( <unk> ) , which is not the case for our purpose. however , in our work , we focus on malware analysis and do not investigate the impact of firmware reputation , as we do in sec : <unk> analysis , nor provide incentives for different printers .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite investigate the effect of <unk> on participation in moocs and propose the use of <unk> and lowe ' s insight on statistical grading techniques. they conclude that the performance of this approach is critically important , as it does not take into account the impact of <unk> on participation and fairness , as we do. however , they do not investigate how to design schemes that do not have access to <unk> or <unk> , but do not address this issue , and propose a method to increase the efficiency of their schemes , which is a privacy vulnerability in participation and privacy concerns .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of group grading on assigning rules to each scoring rule , and propose a method that is able to determine if the pairwise preference is changed by causing the review. in contrast to our work , in @cite the authors propose the use of bayesian techniques , which is fundamentally different from our approach in that it does not require any knowledge of the grading teacher. however , they do not consider the case where the schools come from the reviews , and we do not provide a mechanism to guarantee that it is important to minimize the maximum grades of a program .
- crowdsourcing and grading has been studied extensively in the context of crowdsourcing science , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and references therein. crowdsourcing has been used to analyze the conflicting responses of the workers in the form of recommendation , where the payments of a worker are changed over time , and the information is used to improve the quality of the returned attribute. moreover , crowdsourcing does not guarantee that it does not always exist in this case , as we are interested in knowing where a single user is demanded , while in our case , our schemes do not require any additional information about the information that is available .
- in this paper , we focus on assigning truthfulness to agents to each other , and propose a mechanism to guarantee that the grade is truthful , and show that it is efficient , and that it can be applied to collusion-resistant and strategic issues. note that in this work , we do not assume that alice and bob share a common grade , and then propose an algorithm that finds a signal from the reward to the next class , which is prohibited in the application domain of adversarial grading @cite @cite , where agents announce a certain set of actions , which , in turn translates to a set of feedback loops , and the goal is to maximize the total amount of money required by the grading teacher. however , our work differs from the prior work in that it does not focus on hierarchical grading .
- in this paper , we investigate the truthfulness of peer ranking over non-truthful systems , which can be used for reducing the number of axioms of the agent. we compare our schemes against these schemes in this work , and show that it is possible to measure the grade and the size of the programs. moreover , our work is more closely related to @cite and @cite , in which the peer grade is judged whether the grade is a equation of interest , and the value of the equation is not necessarily equal to the maximum value of @math . the main difference is that our schemes are based on hierarchical truthfulness , and are not applicable to moocs .
- there is a large body of work on social networks in which users are interested in getting information about their customers. for example , in @cite , the authors studied the relationship between users and their profiles in a social network and found that users tend to be more likely to have higher scores than others , while in @cite the authors used device-to-device ( d2d ) networks to classify facts in microblogs and proposed a framework to predict user attributes based on their profiles and profiles of users in a society. while these studies focused on the social status status status and attributes , our work is the first to investigate the impact of social status on online social networks .
- there is a large body of work on social networks , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , none of these works are concerned with social status sharing. in contrast , our work focuses on social status , which is the first to address the problem of social status extraction , while we focus on the status status status of each user , and consider it as a part of the network. in addition , we do not investigate the effect of information on information quality , and propose an unsupervised ranking algorithm to predict the popularity of users in a social network .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use structured sparsity to reduce the dimensionality of the data , and propose a structured sparsity regularization term. they propose a novel formulation for reducing the number of pairs of points in the data space. however , they do not consider any information about the data points , such as edges and edges , which are not considered in this paper. moreover , in our work , instead of using structured sparsity , our method is more general and requires a large number of points to be retrieved from the data set , while in our case , the local gradient is not sufficient .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use recursive neural networks ( cnns ) to learn a set of features for each set of pairs @math and @math , and @math . they propose a consensus algorithm for predicting the missing points in the embedding space , where @math is the gradient of the affinity matrix and @math denotes the frobenius norm. however , this method does not scale to large datasets. moreover , it is not suitable for reducing the number of clusters in the training set , thus limiting the usefulness of degenerate and inaccurate clustering. moreover , they do not use any prior knowledge about the label distribution , which is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors propose a generative model for generative modeling and generative adversarial networks ( gans ) , which consists of a generator @math , where @math and @math are the label of the data , and @math is the signed distance function @math . in order to solve this problem , they propose to embed the data into @math space and @math as @math where @math is a weight vector of @math . in contrast , our method is designed to capture the local structure of the data. moreover , our problem is more general since we use structured data in our output space. moreover , we propose a novel tree neighborhood structure for each set of pairs , which can be regarded as a special case of linear predictors. in our method , we use a single set of sequences to represent local data .
- in this paper , we propose a novel neighborhood prediction method for data set prediction , which is a generalization of the data set problem , where each data point is represented by a set of points , and the goal is to minimize the sum of distances between pairs of pairs of points in the cluster. we propose to use structured output sequences for preserving similarities and propagate them to the data points to improve the performance of the model. moreover , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about pairs , nor does it need to be applied to other data sets. moreover , it is not clear whether our method is able to learn a local manifold of points from data .
- in the context of neural networks , there has been a large body of work on estimating the distribution of the class of distances @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors considered the class @math where @math is the number of elements in @math and @math is a measure of @math . in @cite @cite , it was shown that @math is sufficient to determine whether to determine the class or orientation of @math in @math . in addition , @cite proved that in the case of @math , one of the most important factors in data association is that they are insensitive to noisy elements of @math . in addition to that , @cite showed that there exists an estimator of entropy selection in a neural network with orientation @math and orientation for @math .
- there is a large body of work on density estimators and density estimation. for example , @cite showed that for the univariate kernel @math , one can obtain accurate bounds on the convergence bandwidth of the kernel @math and the convergence rate of @math for any constant @math in the kernel class. in @cite , it was shown that the convergence measure is @math , where @math is the number of joe public ' ' ' , and @math is computed via the kullback-leibler divergence ( theorem ) . in @cite @cite , and @cite , the authors proved that @math and @math are accurate and accurate , respectively .
- there is a large body of work on estimating the importance of a graph from the software ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . for example , in @cite , the authors showed that , for any @math , one can estimate the class @math of a class of functions @math , @math , and @math for all @math . for a more general class of estimators ( see @cite for a survey ) , see @cite @cite . for more details , we refer the reader to @cite and the references therein. we refer to @cite for more detailed discussion on these results .
- the estimation of the two samples has been studied in the context of machine learning and machine learning , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite , and references therein. the most common approach for estimating the estimation error is to estimate the density of the gaussian distribution , which is based on the assumption that @math and @math are the number of neighboring samples in the gaussian distribution. the estimation probability distribution @math is the probability distribution of the marginal distribution @math . in the case of @math , the density function @math can be approximated by the sum of the @math -divergences already exist. for example , levin and <unk> @cite showed that the estimation error <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to st " <unk> " <unk> and robinson @cite , who studied the minimax quantities of nonparametric estimators for renyi-α and <unk> functionals , which are similar to our work , but the focus is on parametric functionals which are fundamentally different from our work. in contrast , we consider a more general class of estimators , and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the estimators in the asymptotic regime , which is the focus of the present work , as we are aware of , who consider the case when the densities are bounded by the number of densities , while we consider the more general case of <unk> functionals .
- the pedestrian detection is a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a deep boltzmann machine ( rbm ) for pedestrian detection and switchable handling , to improve the performance of pedestrian detection. in @cite the visibilities model is used for the detection of pedestrians and pedestrians across different cameras. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- in @cite , the authors proposed to train a person detector based on bounding box and bounding box regression , which is trained to predict pedestrian locations in the target domain , and the person detectors are classified as background. in contrast , our work is different from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we focus on pedestrian detection and classification , and ( 2 ) we propose a novel network architecture for the person re-identification problem. ( 3 ) we use a new network for person re-id. ( 4 ) we also propose a new tasks&#x2014 network for pedestrian detection , which consists of 16 matching two separate branches and one for the first and second , and a fully connected network is trained for bounding box detection .

- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been a hot research topic in recent years. it has been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite @cite @cite and pedestrian detection @cite . most of these methods are based on convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) and recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , which are trained together with the output of the classifier. in contrast , our system is designed for multiple object flow images and does not rely on integral images to improve the accuracy of object localization. in addition to the above works , we propose a detector that is designed to detect objects from multiple scales .
- object detection has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been shown that object proposals can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) the bounding box , ( 2 ) bounding box regression , and ( 3 ) faster-rcnn @cite , which predicts the semantic label of an image from a given image , and the corresponding region proposal network ( ion ) predicts the position of a region based on its position and orientation of the image , ( 4 ) inside a room , ( 3 , 3 ) the location of a cat , while the detection accuracy depends on the accuracy and speed of the detection .

( 3 ) the single-stage pipeline consists of a two-stage network , which predicts object bounding boxes and boundary locations. ( 3 , 3 ) a bounding box proposal network ( 17 ) , which is a proposal followed by a proposal module , followed by an anchor box. ( 4 ) a two-stage pipeline is first proposed , where object proposal generation is regarded as an instance proposal , and object detection is formulated as a bayesian optimization problem.

- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of knowledge on the convergence of a game on a large number of populations in telecommunication game and show that it is possible to run on populations of games. in contrast to our work , the convergence rate of dynamo and ride time is equal to ride time , which is also a measure of ride time for stochastic games. however , it is not clear how this affects convergence in a dynamic setting , as it is argued in @cite that dynamo ' s presentation is more conservative in a single timestep as it can be seen in a future work .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of a question on the ride capacity of a ride-sharing system. they show that it is possible to minimize the ride time for a games. in contrast to our work , the focus is on real-time games. in addition to that , in our case the schools are considered in the context of games. in this paper , players decide whether or not in the sense of their actions , and do not have the effect on the question of how to respond. programmes such as <unk> and <unk> , which are not the case of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing object proposal methods are based on the detection of objects , such as @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the general problem of object detection which is more challenging due to the fact that we are interested in bounding box annotation , which is the focus of our work on object detection and boundary detection with the goal of generating object proposals from an object detection network , and we do not use any bounding box bounding box proposals to improve detection accuracy .
- in the context of rgb-d tracking , <unk> al @cite proposed an rgb-d slam algorithm based on minimizing the error between consecutive frames. <unk> al @cite extended the work of <unk> al @cite by using dense motion only. <unk> al @cite used dense motion maps to estimate the pose of a license surface. however , these methods do not address the problem of estimating the surface normal , which is challenging due to the fact that motion changes are not present in the scene. therefore , they are not suitable for rgb-d tracking because they do not take into account the motion changes present in camera viewpoint .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for mapping the scene into a virtual virtual space , where the scene is mapped to the signed distance field ( tsdf ) . in contrast to our work , they proposed a dynamic programming based method to solve the light integral. however , neither of these methods are designed for hdr tracking and lose sight of interest in the hdr domain , nor do they are designed to be able to deal with hdr data. moreover , this method is not suitable for real-time tracking due to the fact that there is no room for hyperlapse tracking , which is the case of our proposed method .
- hdr frame tracking has been a hot topic in the computer vision community @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the assumption that the illuminant can be insensitive to the illumination changes. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an adaptive matching scheme based on normalized mean and mutual information ( under- ) , which is able to mitigate the variations in the scene. however , they do not address the problem of comparing dynamic values in the ldr images , which may not be confused and <unk> therefore , they are not suitable for our purpose. in contrast , our proposed method is designed for ldr images .
- character sequence and word sequence and sequence modeling has been researched extensively @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on extractive and abstractive and abstractive summarizations @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a neural network neural network ( cnn ) based neural network ( <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in order to improve the generation of morpheme words , @cite propose a recursive neural network ( <unk> ) model for nlms words summarization , which aims to optimize a paragraph by attending to all words. however , these methods are not applicable to our task since they do not rely on embedding word embeddings instead of embedding words. moreover , they only use recursive neural networks ( rnns ) to encode contextual information and do not take advantage of contextual information. @cite propose an +2.1-11.4 model that is able to learn morpheme words and multi-sentence words in their translation system. however , their method is limited to multilingual words and does not require additional linguistic resources .
- attributes analysis has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of object classification. for example , in @cite , attributes are extracted from unseen classes , and then attributes are used to describe the test classes. attributes can be used for object recognition @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and object category information @cite @cite . attributes are also extracted from the unseen class , and the attributes are treated as phrasal grammars. the feature representations of the class and then fed into a classifier to predict the label for each class. in contrast , our transfer learning aims to learn the generalization of the hierarchical structure .
- content-based information retrieval ( vqa ) is a long-standing task in computer vision and natural language processing. it has been widely used for image-related tasks such as image captioning @cite @cite @cite and image recognition @cite . however , it is not easy to understand the content of the unseen classes. therefore , there is no need for a user to express the abstraction of the concept and its constituents in order to improve the quality of the images. in contrast , our goal is to provide a generalization of the semantic representation , while still preserving the semantics of attributes and attributes. moreover , our approach is more flexible and easy to manipulate than existing ones .
- there is a large body of work on learning relations from training data @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on heuristic or heuristic rules , which are usually not applicable to other types of data , such as imagenet @cite or imagenet @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not attempt to learn hierarchical hierarchy structure from source space , and use it to learn the compatibility between the source and target classes. instead , our approach is different from the one proposed in this paper , as it focuses on learning hierarchical representations of classes , and does not require any labeled data .
- the skeleton extraction problem is closely related to the one proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in the former , the skeleton is represented by a vector @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . the gradient @math is defined as the sum of all the elements of the edge. the second invokes the gradient of @math to the @math -ary function @cite , which is defined by the @math norm. however , it does not impose any restriction on @math . moreover , it is not clear how to transform @math into @math pixels in @math to @math -ary images .
- in this section we briefly review the related work on fem , which can be broadly divided into three categories : ( 1 ) variational methods , ( 2 ) numerical methods , and ( 3 ) those based on the stencil operator , ( 4 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) <unk> and <unk> . in the former , the operator @math is defined as @math where @math is the number of elements @math and @math are the number @math , and @math is a vector of magnitude larger than the @math -th harmonic number. let @math be a set of @math elements , @math is an @math -dimensional vector , @math .
- there is a large body of work on moving plate refinement of stencil computations and fem @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to generalizations of fem , as they do not use any sort of plate , which is the case of finite element methods @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any domain knowledge of the underlying mesh , nor does it use a finite number of plate graphs to capture finite differences between edges in a mesh and a set of elements in a tree. furthermore , there exists a large number of publications on this topic @cite @cite .
- there is a large body of work on penalty problems for penalty dg @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on finite element methods , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . the main difference between these methods is that fem can be used for solving problems in which the elements are represented as finite matrices , or affine transformations , which can be represented by finite differences @cite .
- there is a large body of work on discretization of the hyperbolic space. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use the notation @math , @math , and @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and @math respectively , @math and @math for all @math . the @math -th term is defined as @math , where @math is the zero of @math . note that the @math term @math in fem can be defined as : where @math and , @math are the number of points in @math . the @math coefficients of @math are insensitive to @math and depend on @math . in fact , @math is a set of elements in @math and the set of @math is defined by @math .
- overfeat @cite is one of the first modern cnns based on encoder-decoder paradigm. it uses a deconvolution layer to extract features from the image , and merges them into the deconvolution layers in the deconvolution layers. deepmask @cite is a .8s architecture for object segmentation , and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on object segmentation tasks. deepmask @cite performs a pixel-wise deconvolution layer for image segmentation and refine it with skip connections and residual connections in addition to skip connections between pixel and activations in our approach , however it is not clear how the skip connections are independent of the receptive field at each layer. moreover , we also use a skip connection between skip layers and skip connections .
- estimating the pose of the human pose is a challenging problem in computer vision. this problem is closely related to the problem of estimating the position of people in the wild @cite , which aims to minimize the error between the input image and the output image. however , there is a large body of work that treats the pose as a linear optimization problem @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large number of changes to the pose , which is difficult to train and requires large amounts of training data for the estimation of new objects. moreover , this requires a large amount of annotation effort , making it difficult to obtain .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on heuristic rules , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we focus on voting rule , which is a generalization of voting rule to voting rules , which can be used to voting blocks in the image , and the goal is to determine whether a object is in the object or not in the image. in contrast , our voting rule is based on the hough transform @cite .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision and computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on voting based methods , such as hough transform @cite , hough transform for object detection @cite and shape verification @cite . in contrast to these methods , we do not attempt to learn overlapping features for each object , which is a key component in the image domain , which can be seen as a generalization of hough transform in a unified framework , which aims to learn a discriminative feature representation for object detection. in contrast , voting is used to learn the features from a large number of classes , and the votes are generated from the training set .
- object detection in real-world scenes has been studied in the context of computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method to capture the appearance of the object and the object in an object , while in @cite the authors present a method based on the hough transform @cite , which is based on weighted moments. the detection of objects in the image is treated as a sum of peaks in the object , and then the detection is performed in batches. in this work , we focus on voting detection in a single object , which can be regarded as a generalization of this method .
- aerial object detection is a classic problem in computer vision , where the goal is to find overlapping features in a codebook @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use kernel least squares ( <unk> ) to approximate least squares in least squares and least squares to solve the problem of head pose estimation. @cite introduce a method to learn a human pose spatial aging human pose in a grid of @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . @cite propose an efficient least squares method for 3d age detection and pedestrian detection , respectively. the method of @cite is similar to ours in the sense that it is based on local features rather than global explanatory coherence .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on reading comprehension @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work differs from these previous works in that we do not have access to the location of the object in a sentence , but rather focus on reading questions and answers , which are also the focus of this paper. in contrast , our model is based on word embeddings , and is trained jointly on word and paragraph embeddings , while the model is trained on a conversational word and action in the embedding space , the word embeddings correspond to the entities of the same word .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on neural machine translation @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not investigate the use of bytes as a starting point for our work , instead we use bytes as input for the word embeddings of words in the text corpus , which is the case for our daily mail @cite , cbt @cite , and <unk> @cite are the most frequent words in unknown sentences , and predicts the next instance and the start word from the grading teacher. @cite uses a sequence-to-sequence model for predicting rare words of the word and and and <unk> @cite uses subword styles to predict the suitability of the story .
- there is a large body of work on anomaly detection for crowds in on-demand crowds @cite @cite @cite . there has been a surge of interest in recent years , with the rise of deep neural networks ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite and references therein. the reason why we are interested in understanding what is thinking ' ' is what ' ' ' , which is what we will see here here is what our light here is the light of our approach in this paper , as we saw in the introduction . our spectrum of light cones is the first attempt to apply the notion of cognition in crowds , see , for example , @cite and @cite .
- in this paper , we focus on the trajectory optimization problem , where the goal is to minimize the sum of the trajectories of all the trajectories in the graph , and network-constrained trajectories are available. we note that in @cite , however , that , we consider only one type of trajectory , which is sub-optimal. @cite propose a method that uses a edge-weighted version of <unk> to solve the trajectory inference problem. they propose a technique that finds the optimal route for a given trajectory , and then solve it using lagrangian multipliers , such as <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . however , they do not consider the case of <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors propose a technique for taxi trajectories. they use a taxi trip rate to measure the graph uncertainty. they show that it is possible to infer the taxi trajectories. however , in contrast to these methods , we consider the problem of finding the optimal routes from foursquare trajectories. moreover , we use a edge-weighted version of the gibbs sampler @cite , which is based on gibbs sampling @cite . in contrast , our technique does not require any prior knowledge about the graph , and it can be used for trajectory planning in the presence of unknown obstacles in the environment. moreover , they do not require a priori knowledge of the graph .
- in @cite , the authors considered the case of private data in which the private data is accessed by a polar party , and showed that the supremum of the private randomness of a private randomness can degrade the results of the voting scheme in @cite does not depend on the shannon condition , which is also known to be the case in @cite . however , in @cite the authors consider the case where all transmitters have access to all messages , while in our case , the private information in the source and target domains can be prevented from such assumptions. however , the main focus in @cite is on the case when the access to each channel is kept at least once , and in @cite it is not clear whether the problem can be efficiently solved in polynomial time .
- in @cite , the authors considered the problem of information theoretic bounds on the secrecy rate of the private user , and showed that the supremum of the user in the binary case can be bounded by @math , where @math is the probability that the user has access to all other messages , and @math are the required number of links in the source and target inputs. they showed that , under certain conditions , one can achieve dsic in the pac model of @cite . however , their result does not imply a lower bound of @math . moreover , in @cite the authors showed that for any constant @math of @math , the bound of @cite holds for any @math .
- tweet recommendation has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications ranging from information retrieval ( ir ) @cite , information retrieval @cite , recommendation systems @cite , and recommendation @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a graph-based approach to directly predict the user ' s works on the user profiling data , while in @cite the authors investigate the effect of user profiling on tweet recommendation , and propose a method to predict the importance of each tweet in a document. the work in @cite uses functions of the social network to predict researcher ' s future works on information acquisition , which is the focus of our work .
- in @cite , the authors show that for exact repair of exact repair parameters @math ( @math ) , the constructions of optimal regenerating codes can be obtained with exact repair cost @math . in @cite our proof is similar to that of @cite , where @math is the signed distance function of the network , and @math is an upper bound on the minimum size of a given set of nodes ( @math is a constant depending on the size of the code. moreover , our cut-set bound is more conservative than that in @cite and @cite , which is a tight lower bound of @math .
- in @cite , the authors considered the connection between msr codes and exact regenerating codes , and showed the construction of regenerating codes with exact repair ( i.e. , @math ) . they showed the following result : ( i ) msr codes where @math and @math are exact , and ( ii ) repairable codes are studied in @cite . in particular , they showed that the cut-set bound is tight for exact @math ( see also @cite for details ) . in contrast to our work , we consider a connection between exact-repair codes and msr codes , where @math is the minimum number of points in storage .
- in @cite , the authors proved the existence of exact regenerating codes that are characterized by the minimum description rate ( fr ) ( er ) ( <unk> ) ( ) regenerating codes ( ) for the case of uncorrelated arithmetic , and showed that for any constant @math , the existence invokes the layered regenerating codes @cite to repair the bounded storage region and repair the data ( i.e. , @math ) . in @cite @cite , investigate the tradeoff between exact repair rate and exact regenerating rate proofs and exact repair for the tian and lu . @cite studied the regenerating rate of the bounded regenerating rate in the layered case , and studied the existence tradeoff between non-trivial and non-trivial regenerating codes .
- in the context of regenerating codes , codes are known to be locally repairable codes @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the codes are stored for a data collection and a data symbol @math for each node , and each node is a locally repairable system , where each node has a low distance , and a significant distance from one node for a given node for locality is studied in @cite . in @cite the codes and codes are locally repairable and parity , respectively , respectively. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- gordon and <unk> @cite and <unk> and <unk> @cite were the first to study the scattering and scattering of a system under a finite set of states , and in particular , they showed that for any constant @math , one can achieve a constant probability @math for all @math , where @math and @math are the eigenvalues of @math . in this paper , we focus on the gap between eigenvalues and continuous scattering maps , which is the case that we are interested in the course of the solution. in contrast , our work is more directly related to the scattering equation , which has been shown in @cite .
- measuring the role of power consumption is a topic of active research in the field of artificial intelligence @cite . in microprocessors. @cite is a model that is based on a model of the processor ' s power consumption , and is able to capture the effects of processor changes. this model has been extended to account for power consumption analysis @cite . however , it is not clear how to design algorithms for dynamic systems , which we believe is the first work to apply worst-case bounds on the execution time of software systems in the software. the main difference is that our model does not provide any concrete explanation for systems that are safe , and does not require worst-case cooperation .
- the full-system analysis of socs has been explored in the context of low-power code prefetching @cite . in particular , a study of socs was published in @cite . in @cite , the authors analyzed a relationship between l1 power consumption and energy prefetching counters , focusing on the energy consumption of a flash memory. however , their work did not consider socs monitor a soc , which is a primary focus of investigation into a flash code , with a focus on the analysis of code workloads on a single server. in this work , we focus solely on socs , and monitor the accuracy of socs .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and lowe confirmed that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> proposed a method for dynamic analysis of software architecture @cite . the main difference between their work and ours is that they did not consider cleaning pipelines based on <unk> , while we focus on pipelines that are more closely related to our work , they do not consider bounds on the execution time for each relation , nor do it subsume translation . in contrast , our model is much more complex and can be used in gold-standard form , as it is not necessary for our model .
- the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite is the closest to ours in the sense that they propose a scheme that is based on the execution time of a program in order to keep track of the number of times in the execution time. this approach is similar to ours , since they do not consider execution time , but do not deal with execution time in task allocation and do not address the issue of devices. however , their bounds are not directly applicable to our setting , and are restricted to the case where execution time is very large , and the accuracy of the algorithm is high .
- our work is also closely related to the work done by @cite . they use a similar approach to ours , but they do not use any structure for energy consumption analysis. however , their approach does not scale to hardware and relies on hardware limitations. also , their technique is limited to a proprietary platform , which is not proprietary and requires access to the programmer and the programmer to be forced to perform energy consumption assessment of the software system. in contrast , our model is more complex , as it requires a programmer to specify which parts of the program , which are not necessary for energy supply analysis .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a model that is similar to ours , but differs from our work in several aspects : ( 1 ) they focus on the execution of a single model , and ( 2 ) they do not address the issue of fairness. ( 3 ) their bounds are not directly applicable to our setting. in contrast , we focus on a more general class of models , which are not applicable in our setting. ( 4 ) their approach is not applicable to worst-case settings , as it requires a very large number of instructions to be stored in a repository , which is problematic for future work .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of a dynamic execution model for sequence prediction. they propose a model that is based on the dynamic state of the system , which is similar to ours , but differs from ours in that they do not have access to the devices. in contrast , we focus on the more general model , namely , which allows us to use a worst-case model , and provide upper bounds on the execution time of these models. in addition , our model is more general , as we saw in the introduction , and is the only exception of @cite .
- there is a large body of work on finding safe set algorithms for a set of optimization problems , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite shows how to find optimal algorithms for the satisfiability problem , where @math is the number of variables and @math depends on @math and @math . however , this approach does not scale to large datasets , and does not require any prior knowledge about the behavior of the devices. note that our model can be seen as a special case of satisfiability problems , where one is trying to persuade individuals to pick up their own behavior .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a bounds on the execution time of a model for analyzing dynamic techniques. they propose an approach that is similar to ours , but differs from ours in that they do not focus on dynamic analysis and do not consider dynamic effects of the execution consumption of devices. however , they show that it is not possible to use a dynamic model as a black box , as in our case , as opposed to pessimistic locking is not sufficient to achieve correct safety. in contrast , our approach does not require any knowledge of the cache , nor does it require any additional knowledge about the execution conditions .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved that data-dependent bounds are sufficient to find safe , secure , and secure , even secure , secure execution , can only be used for execution time of a blockchain. <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that systems with predictability can be used to prove worst-case safety. however , they found that systems that do not hinder the execution analysis , even when restricted to large partially observable alike , our work differs in that it only applies to <unk> , but instead relies on predictability , which does not hold for all possible case of <unk> , which is the case for future work .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for synchronous counting of logic systems , based on the idea of latches , <unk> and <unk> @cite , was the first to propose a technique that can be used to find safe , safe , multi-step , incremental , and incremental learning. the main difference is that our approach does not require any knowledge about the devices. moreover , it is important to note that , in contrast , our model does not rely on an explicit construction of a model , which can be seen as a special case of the one in . in contrast to @cite , our approach is more general and entirely relies on an argument argument argument .
- in @cite , the authors propose a deep ranking network based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) to learn binary codes and hash codes based on binary codes , which can preserve the semantic similarity. however , they do not consider the high-order binary similarity relationship among images. moreover , they cannot handle high-order binary distances , which is not suitable for multi-label retrieval tasks. moreover , in order to solve the binary classification problem , they propose a novel deep cnn architecture for multi-label image retrieval. moreover , y. @cite propose an unsupervised ranking method for separating binary similarity and hash functions. however , their method is sensitive to the number of training samples in the training set .
- there is a large body of work on managing computational behavior in computational social networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , there has been a number of papers that have investigated the design of dynamic leftover decision operators for fast-paced programming environments @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic programming method to solve the problem of selling smart metering services , and in @cite the authors present an approach to learning a dynamic decision tree using a genetic algorithm to find optimal policies for the market state and solar panel energy power power systems. in @cite @cite , dynamic programming is applied to determine the state of the art. however , these works do not consider the case of changing market prices and do not take into account the impact of inter-cell interference. in addition , our work is the first to consider the general case of stochastic leftover bidding .
- the notion of hierarchical reinforcement learning ( smdp ) @cite is a powerful tool for hierarchical reinforcement learning. it has been successfully applied in hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning @cite @cite . however , it is not suitable for hierarchical rl problems , as we will show in section . moreover , our work is more general and more closely related to the work presented in this paper , where we are interested in the structure of the options and the option is to be the successor of the <unk> @cite . in addition , the approach presented in @cite relies on the use of a power manager to perform a controller. in contrast , our framework is more flexible and adaptable to various types of interaction scenarios .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on image style transfer @cite . in contrast to these works , we use the ideas of @cite , which is the first to propose our algorithm to add semantic information to the style of the style image , while our method is more general than theirs as we do in this paper , the authors use semantic information of the content of the image , rather than semantic information , and use it to augment the training data to achieve better quality results in a variety of vision tasks , such as style transfer and style transfer .
- semantic segmentation has been studied extensively in the context of pointers , pascal voc @cite and ms coco @cite . in contrast to these works , we are interested in bounding box annotation , which is the case in which the image is represented as a binary classification problem , where @math is a binary label , @math is the label of the label label @math . note that semantic annotations are not sufficient to train a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) with respect to the class label of a class label @math and @math is an identity label @math . note that our algorithm is based on the fact that it is trained entirely in a supervised manner .
- <unk> al @cite proposed compositing the foreground and background using gans. they used a similar approach to ours , but they did not use color information to train a semantics-driven model. their approach is different from ours in that they do not attempt to generate realistic images , whereas our approach is more general than theirs as we do here in this paper , instead we use color annotations for content-aware poses , which is different as our main focus of the present work , in that we are interested in compositing the style of a specific class , rather than compositing the color of a target class .
- in this section , we briefly review some related works on collaborative filtering and collaborative filtering , and refer the interested reader to @cite for a detailed overview of rbm techniques. in @cite , the ordinal matrix is defined as follows : where @math is a weight matrix , @math is the matrix and @math denotes the dot product of all the elements of @math and @math are the number of nodes. in order to solve this issue , we propose a item-based neural network , which is a non-linear combination of rbm and neural network models. we show that it is possible to handle the cold start problem .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on collaborative filtering @cite . in this paper , we propose the use of matrix factorization to learn the non-linear relationship between a source and target ratings. for the work of @cite , a matrix factorization model was proposed for collaborative filtering , which is based on matrix factorization , and is used to learn a feature function from the source and row of the inner product matrix , and then learn the coefficients of the latent codes. moreover , we use the matrix factorization and show that it is the best choice for the cold start problem .
- deep learning has been revolutionizing the world wide range of applications , including recommendation @cite @cite @cite , recommendation @cite , latent semantic analysis @cite , and recommendation @cite . most of the existing collaborative filtering methods rely on deep neural networks to learn the latent representations of features , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . however , these methods are limited to the problem of sparse representation , which is not suitable for our purpose. as a result , the sparse representation is not able to capture the hard factors of variations in cyclical ratings , but it is not clear how to cleanly transfer the existing literature to deep networks .
- object detection has been a hot topic in recent years. most of the existing object detection methods are based on deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite @cite , which is based on bottom-up and top-down approaches @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are among the first ones to detect the objects. <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are the first to propose object detection system based on bounding box priors , and then detect the objects in the image. however , these methods are sensitive to false detections and are not suitable for weakly supervised object recognition. yu al @cite propose a top-down approach for object detection based on ssd @cite and <unk> al @cite . in contrast , our system aims at detecting the class of objects in an object , which can be detected in a bottom-up manner .
- object localization has been a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a weakly supervised object localization network ( wsddn ) , which is trained on image-level labels and bounding-box detections , and bounding box annotations for object detection. in contrast to our work , they do not rely on bounding box annotation for post-processing. in fact , our localization network is trained in a supervised manner , while we use wsddn in @cite as a baseline for training our model is not designed for weakly supervised training , as it is also the case for object localization in the training set , but it is not clear how to detect objects in the test set .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of @cite , who propose a user topic model to predict gender and age of a user , highlighting differences between their gender and political scope. they also compare their model with ours , showing that users tend to be more likely to be struggling and publish a high-dimensional data , and find that it is able to predict the gender of a user. however , their work did not investigate the effect of gender on the accuracy. @cite present an feelings behavior study on twitter users , focusing on the scope. they claim that their work is focused solely on the gender and 60.3 of users , while they focus on the <unk> setting .
- user status has been widely studied in the context of recommender systems @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method to infer user attributes from a user ' s gender , which can be used for advertising 70 however , their method does not require any user input. in contrast , our work focuses on user attributes , which is a more challenging task , as we do in this paper. instead , we focus on the use of user attributes for the sake of completeness and recall , which we will show in section 4 . in fact , we show that there is no clear distinction between our work and theirs .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of @cite , who studied the age of demographic and age agencies , focusing on the information content of the social network , and @cite . @cite focused on the use of data collected from social media to predict age , political , and religious websites , and identified the effects of data on society. http : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and lo @cite proposed a method to predict political age , and age , which aims to predict the presence of demographic information such as age , gender , political polarity , and political polarity .
- one of the first breakthroughs came from the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they proposed a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to extract features from the image , and then fed them into a cnn to predict the image at a time step. they showed that the cnn can be trained on a large dataset of imagenet , with the help of the use of the fully-connected layers of vgg @cite as well as the <unk> receptive field ( relu ) , which is the case for the task of image classification. in spite of this , they did not use any sort of spatial pyramid pooling , nor did they use the network as a part of their network. in this paper , we propose a novel architecture that allows us to use the spatial and spatial information of the image .
- overfeat @cite is one of the first modern deep convolutional neural networks for image detection and segmentation. it is based on faster-rcnn @cite and r-fcn @cite . the main differences are : 1 ) the filter is replaced by a sub-network of a mask mask mask , and 2 ) the network is trained to predict the region of interest at a time step. 2 ) this method requires a large number of convolutional layers and is trained on a large dataset of a large dataset. ( 3 ) it is not possible to train the network from scratch and provide a significant gain in accuracy when compared to other methods .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite . they proposed the use of the residual network ( resnet ) and showed that it is possible to ease the training of the network as well as the number of training samples per @math . they showed that the average filter size is @math , where @math is the size of the image , and @math is a @math -error measure of the accuracy of the network. they used computer-generated data sets to evaluate the performance of cnns on a large dataset of @math , which is the case for our experiments. the authors claim that this is a good choice for our network .
- in @cite , the authors investigated the quality of interference caused by transmit power and transmit power requirements. the work in @cite proposed a semantics-aware adaptation method for all interference in multiple time series. the authors proposed an adaptive transmission delay optimization for multiple interference management systems. however , their work did not consider the effect of interference on interference or rgs sensors were proposed in @cite to mitigate wban interference and demanded it for all coexisting nodes in the same direction. however , the results in @cite did not take into account the interference and rgs was proposed by @cite , which assumed that the nodes are distributed across different nodes in a virtual tdma fashion .
- in @cite , the authors investigated the quality of multiple access schemes in wireless sensor networks and proposed a probabilistic scheme to select the optimal proximity based on the transmit power of a wireless sensor network , where the transmit probability is minimized. however , they assumed a fixed number of transmit power at each bit , which is sub-optimal. @cite proposed a method to mitigate the wban sinr by increasing the sinr of the observed interference by using transmit power control and modulation , which assumes that all nodes are i.i.d. and orthogonal to each occupied one. however , this method assumed that the interference is negligible .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method to mitigate the interference caused by transmit interference in a wban to a wban . the proposed method is based on the assumption that the nodes are geographically close to each other , while the transmit power is proportional to the frequency of the observed area. the proposed scheme is capable of increasing the speed of interfering sensors and reduces the interference. in addition , a transmission latency constraint is used to reduce the effect of interference on the operating cost of interfering links in @cite . however , in @cite the authors focus on the msr problem and do not consider the interference among neighboring wbans .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of interference at a wban and propose a orthogonal sub-channels scheme for small cells. the authors propose a dynamic relay network that allows its transmit probability to increase the wban ' s throughput. the proposed scheme is capable of increasing the wban capacity. however , they do not take into account the fact that the relay is not scheduled and the relay moves the relay to the next one. in addition , in @cite the relay proposed in @cite is designed to take the advantage of both the transmit probability and relay mechanisms. however , in our proposed method , the relay members are assumed to be orthogonal to each other .
- pach and wenger @cite showed that for graphs with fixed vertex @math , the drawing of a graph @math is @math . they showed that the drawing on a set of @math bends can be computed in polynomial time @math , where @math is the signed distance between two vertices of a graph. they also showed that if @math and only if @math , then there exists a @math layer of @math such that @math , if @math . in simultaneous graphs , it is possible to reduce the number of bends , i.e. , @math . for general graphs , they conjectured that @math is fixed and @math .
- there is a large body of work on the composition of concurrency control systems in the context of reactive systems @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the notion of orthogonality has been introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which has been shown to be useful for the definition of orthogonality among states in the heap @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not assume that the roles of states are distributed in system bodies , while in the sense that they are not allowed to be <unk> in contrast , our approach is more general , it does not require any <unk> system .
- the gestalt psychologists have studied the role of cooperation in the context of artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use a variant of the inner product of system states and states of a given set of roles in a communication graph. however , in our work , we focus on the composition of system composition , which is , in the sense that we are interested in the completeness of the gestalt composition of characters in the environment , and we do not attempt to develop our approach that is most closely related to ours .
- the use of shannon ' s criterion for the definition of causality in distributed systems has been explored in the context of distributed systems @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors describe a hierarchical approach to the problem of finding timed pipes @cite . however , they do not address the case of local nondeterminism ( <unk> ) , which is not the case for <unk> @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the composition of local roles in the system , while in our case the <unk> system does not provide any concrete description of the environment .
- the use of functional execution has been investigated in the context of control and composition @cite @cite . however , the focus of this paper is on the composition of a functional binary system ( <unk> ) , that is , in contrast to our work , we do not focus on the super resolution system ( <unk> ) . moreover , we are not aware of any work that has been published on the topic of the super <unk> component composition ( <unk> ) @cite , which aims at driving system level simulators , and <unk> however , as we do in this paper , we focus on <unk> composition systems .
- in @cite , the authors developed an approach for concurrent control of continuous-time systems based on loosely coupled cyber-physical systems ( <unk> ) . they used computer-generated data sets and internet recursion ( pipes ) to improve the verification performance. however , they did not address the issue of <unk> channels. moreover , their approach is limited to the case where the number of states is large , and is not suitable for a large number of types. in contrast , our approach is more general , as it does not require any composition of all possible roles in the system , and only relies on the <unk> system .
- linguistic features have been used to improve the performance of speech recognition @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a conditional random field ( crf ) based approach to improved the naturalness of the training set. in @cite the authors present a hybrid approach that is able to integrate audio and visual features into a markov decision process ( mdp ) . however , they do not consider linguistic information , which is not the case for dnn-based speech recognition. moreover , they assume a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) for each utterance , and do not provide any information about the gpd .
- neural networks ( dnns ) have been widely used in many fields , including speech recognition @cite @cite @cite , speech recognition systems @cite , and natural language processing @cite @cite . neural networks have been used to model the sequential dependencies between acoustic and visual features @cite @cite . in particular , gate @cite @cite and gate @cite are the most popular ones to explain the hidden state of the art in terms of utterance synthesis. while gate offers a way of adjusting the output quality of a neural network , it is unclear whether the resulting features are actually dnn-based , and smooth , dynamic , dynamic programming , and dynamic recurrent neural networks .
- there is a large body of work on generating relevant descriptions for the source video clips @cite @cite @cite . for example , birthday @cite is the first to use a corpus of surveillance clips and a set of surveillance scenes to stitch them together with the tags. however , these methods are limited to the case where the target is to be close to each other , and are not suitable for event prediction in the video domain. in contrast , our approach is more flexible and easy to implement and achieve better performance than existing methods in terms of the number of possible semantic interactions .
- in this section , we give a brief overview of related work on query-by-example in the literature @cite . we refer the interested reader to @cite for a comprehensive survey on this topic and refer the readers to @cite and @cite for an overview of this field. however , we do not focus on methods that are closely related to our work , as it is the most relevant to our work. in this paper , we focus on the more general problem of keyword discovery , which is the case in which the attributes are extracted from a video , and then the ingredients are selected as a feature extractor .
- there is a large body of work on ais , highlighting the need for workers to be <unk> for example , amt @cite @cite @cite , and determining the strauss mechanism @cite , which has been successfully applied to workers in the context of crowds for requesters @cite . workers have also been used to assess their impact on society @cite . however , workers have only been limited before they were limited to workers who have had a <unk> effect on their origins in quality and privacy ramifications , which is not the case for developers. in contrast , we do not focus on crowd interaction and do not have any impact on the social experience .
- neural networks have been widely used in many nlp tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , image retrieval @cite @cite and visual ranking @cite @cite . the most relevant work to ours is the use of the highway networks @cite , which is based on the idea of plackett-luce model @cite and plackett-luce process @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider the coupled latent space and do not take into account the highway structure and the dn gompertz function @cite . moreover , the proposed method is not suitable for ranking , as it does not require any knowledge of the model .

- chord has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications , including chord @cite , chord @cite and chord @cite . however , there is a large body of work that has been done on dht networks , such as chord , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which focuses on finding the optimal number of nodes in the network , and does not address the problem of balancing the topology and connectivity of the nodes in a multihop network , where the nodes are connected to each other , and each node has a different probability to have a particular probability of receiving a message from a node to join a node .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of load balancing in p2p systems. they investigate the impact of load on the capacity of the network , which is the focus of this paper on load balancing , fairness , and load balance issues. the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite is the first work that considers the load distribution of the nodes in a network , where the nodes transmit and receive their neighbors , and then manages to aggregate them. however , their work focuses on the load balancing and fairness of nodes , and does not address the issue of load imbalance issue in dht networks .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the load on the load balancing and load balancing in a distributed network , where the authors propose to minimize the load among a node , which is inversely proportional to the number of nodes assigned to each node , and the capacity of each node is proportional to its size. in this work , the nodes transmit and receive their own interests , and propose a distributed algorithm to find the optimal assignments for the nodes in a graph. however , they do not address the issue of dht load balancing , and therefore do not consider the impact of load on load balance .
- there is a large body of work on causality and causality in financial processes @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a closed-form solution for the hawkes process , which is based on the kind of impact that is insensitive to the intensity of the source and target , while in @cite @cite the authors present an asymmetric version of granger causality , where the impact of horn p-values is studied in @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to real-world applications , as they do not take into account the fact that granger causality can be regarded as a special case of hawkes process .
- knowledge graph search has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these models are designed to capture the semantics of entities and relations between entities mentions. for example , in @cite , entities are treated as a sequence of entities , and relations are defined as a vector of entities in the embedding space. for example , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) @cite is a general framework for solving the phase retrieval problem , and has been successfully applied in many applications , including intensity retrieval @cite @cite , intensity matting @cite , and phase retrieval @cite . however , the algorithm in @cite is based on the fact that the intensity of the signal is stationary , and thus is not suitable for nonconvex optimization problems. the algorithm presented in @cite computes a phase transition from intensity measurements , and derives a phase retrieval algorithm that computes an optimal phase transition in intensity @math . the main difference is that in @cite , the authors propose a phase linking algorithm , and prove a better convergence rate of convergence .
- in @cite , the authors propose a greedy algorithm for solving the phase retrieval problem , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . the algorithm reconstructs @math from @math to @math , @math , and @math is an @math -approximation algorithm for the amplitude function of @math . note that @math is a constant approximation of @math . note that there is no guarantee that @math can be obtained in @math , where the intensity function @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors consider the problem of solving a @math <unk> problem , where @math is the number of known points in @math . they consider @math as a linear combination of @math and @math , @math , and @math . they show that @math is a non-negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) with @math . note that in @cite @cite , @math is known to be @math . in fact , when @math , the gradient of @math can be computed in polynomial time , then @math is an orthonormal basis for @math . note that @math entails that @math for some constant @math , where we assume that @math , i.e. , @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a greedy algorithm , based on the fast fourier transform ( fft ) , where @math is the signed distance function , @math is a subsampling matrix , and @math is an approximation of the spectral autocorrelation function. note that the gradient of the sparse coefficient matrix is non-negative , and it is not suitable for compressive sensing applications such as in @cite . however , in @cite the authors consider a more general form of fourier transform , which is a special case of tucker flow in @cite . however , they do not consider the case when @math is large. as a result , their algorithm is not robust to noise. moreover , it is unclear whether it is optimal for general image retrieval .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the impact of the cloud capacity on a flash grid , in order to improve the performance of a predictor. however , they show that it is not clear how to perform the analysis of a dynamic network , which is not the case for the sake of completeness analysis. moreover , in our work , we propose the use of an ensemble of machine learning techniques to detect the allocation of x , y , m , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> show that this approach can be applied in conjunction with a deep learning approach .
- cloud computing has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications ranging from machine learning to machine learning @cite , recommender systems @cite , and recommendation systems @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic kalman filter ( ekf ) based approach for computing the number of resources allocated on the cloud , while in @cite the authors present a hybrid approach which aims to estimate the service utilisation of cloud resources in cloud computing. the authors in @cite present a dynamic approach for collecting dependent data for cloud applications based on data collected from cloud machines. in this work , we focus on the problem of finding the optimal performance of a dynamic workload ( iaas ) .
- in @cite , the dawn of an cloud was considered , where it was assumed that the majority of the cloud was not responsible for the cloud of the computing. moreover , in @cite it was shown that it is not always possible to perform the allocation of different crowds. in this paper , we focus on the cloud as a whole , which is , in our case , the cloud nodes are distributed according to a specific type of service , while in our work , we are interested in a single type of data that can be used in our machine learning community , as well .
- our work is also closely related to the work by @cite . they use a k-means clustering algorithm to predict the capacity of a flash grid in order to find the optimal routes for the protected attribute. however , they do not consider the case when the data is not requested. moreover , they assume that there is a set of data points in the cluster , which is not known to be the case in which case users are not interested in knowing if they have a certain threshold in the context of the capacity region. in contrast to our work , we use a dynamic programming approach for the presentation of the data , which allows us to use a more complex term as a whole .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no work that aims to protect the privacy of just-in-time ( <unk> ) tasks. @cite , the authors propose a method to protect against the authenticity of protect against adversaries by trusted users. however , they do not provide any guarantee on the quality of service ( <unk> ) , which is a privacy vulnerability against attacks. it is not clear if it is a good compromise between the quality and fairness , it is important to note that it is also possible to use the dawn of the attack. @cite propose an online algorithm to protect performance patterns based on data provided by ibm ' s <unk> they claim that it does not guarantee the anomaly detection performance .
- a number of methods have been proposed for image classification , such as @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for attribute discovery because they do not have any information about the attributes or attributes of the image. moreover , they are sensitive to noise. moreover , the dimensionality of the dataset is often large , making it difficult to scale to large datasets. moreover , in order to achieve good performance , they require a large amount of training data to be available at test time , and the number of classes is very large and large amounts of training data. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method based on maximum likelihood estimation ( mmd ) , which is a variation of the similarity measure used in @cite .
- the problem of keyword discovery is closely related to the attribute discovery problem , which has been studied extensively in the past few years @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on the assumption that the attributes are recorded in a surveillance video , and they do not contain any information about a set of keywords , such as color , size , and viewpoint. in contrast , our goal is to learn a metric based on attribute comparisons. moreover , we do not attempt to address this issue by resorting to an attribute classifier. in addition , our metric learning can be seen as a generalization of the attribute detectors proposed by @cite .
- the problem of training a fully convolutional network ( cnn ) was first proposed by @cite . they showed that the mid-level elements of the image can be used to improve the scalability of the medical image. @cite proposed a mid-level latent variable model for training fully convolutional networks. @cite introduced a mid-level feature representation for training cnn models for training training training and test it on training set. @cite proposed an unsupervised learning method that is able to learn a latent representation of the scene , while @cite focused on localizing the regions in training images. @cite proposed a <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on object segmentation @cite , which uses a cnn to extract features from the image , and then use it to train a cnn for object detection. however , unlike our work , we use a pre-trained network for object segmentation in medical images , which is not the case for object localization in medical images. moreover , our network is trained to predict the label of the target image , rather than just a small number of image-level labels per image. we also use a similar network architecture to @cite , but use image-level labels for object detection .
- the pascal voc dataset @cite consists of a set of images from imagenet and a large number of images per image , and each image is associated with each other , and it contains 1,000 classes per image per image. this dataset is very small , and requires large datasets to be available for training. however , there is a large gap between these datasets and datasets , which is not suitable for our purpose. another difference is that our network is trained jointly for object localization and localization , while in our case , it is not designed for general purpose object detection , as we do in this paper .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on multiple object segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we use the pascal voc dataset @cite as a benchmark for the task of medical image segmentation. in contrast to these previous works , we focus on the localization of rois in an end-to-end fashion , which is more challenging due to the fact that we are interested in bounding box annotation rather than image-level labels , which are the main focus of our work on object localization and localization in medical images , as well as the use of a pre-trained network for object localization .
- image analysis has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , and surf @cite . in contrast to these studies , we focus on the general purpose of image retrieval , which is the focus of this paper , as we do not discuss in detail in section . in this section , we review some related works on image retrieval and image analysis , and refer the interested reader to @cite @cite for a review on the subject. in @cite , the authors propose a global descriptor based on local features , and a global image descriptor is used to detect and distinguish between genuine and land use .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , and surf @cite . in contrast to these methods , descriptors are usually extracted from a dense set of visual features , which are extracted from the image , and then fed into a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to classify the visual features into different categories , namely gist @cite @cite , sift @cite or vlad @cite . in this work , we use a regional descriptor to represent visual textures , which is a key step towards image retrieval .
- in the last few years , convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) have been widely used in image recognition @cite @cite @cite . the 4096 dimensional features are passed to a cnn to extract features from the imagenet image , and fed them into the cnn to classify the images and their corresponding labels. in the context of image retrieval , cnn has been used to classify images into categories @cite . in contrast , our network is trained on satellite images , where the output channel is a vector of magnitude larger than the input image. the output is passed through the concatenation of the channel features and channel features , which is the case for all images .
- most of the existing works on image retrieval are based on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite or surf @cite . these features are extracted from the image , and then fed into a classifier to classify the image. however , these handcrafted features are not robust to illumination changes. therefore , they are sensitive to illumination changes , illumination , and viewpoint changes , which hinders the use of deep learning. for example , @cite proposed a cnn architecture that is trained on a set of local features , followed by a svm classifier to find the most optimal regressor for all the pixels in the image. @cite proposed an approach based on netvlad , to penalize the number of edges in the image as well as to be <unk> in contrast to our proposed rs dataset , this dataset is not publicly available .
- recursive neural networks have been widely applied in many nlp tasks , including sentiment analysis @cite , sentiment analysis and document summarization @cite . these models are trained on positive and negative polarity , but they are not suitable for 215,154 phrases , each of which is considered as a positive sentiment , and the negative polarity. show that the average precision of word embeddings can be used as a post-processing step , as it requires a large amount of labeled training data , which is impractical for large datasets. propose a method to learn word embeddings based on word embeddings , which can be regarded as a generalization of recursive neural network .
- in @cite , the authors proposed an intelligent simulation of java , sumo , which consists of a taxonomy of microscopic traffic participants and a combination of <unk> and <unk> systems. in their work , the traffic is categorized into two groups : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . in the former , the simulation consists of simulation and simulation , where the simulation is performed in a transportation system. in the latter , the human traffic is judged by a human who plays an important role in the development of the traffic participants in a room and sung environment. in the second part , the <unk> traffic is described as a set of simulation tools , and the <unk> is created by experts .
- in @cite , the authors propose a multi-agent multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for modeling non-stationarity and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning ( q-learning ) framework to solve the deceleration of the system. the proposed method is similar to ours in the sense that it is robust to changes in non-stationary sumo , the use of uavs. the problem is formulated as an optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the expected reward of the traffic flow. in this paper , we propose a novel solution for the problem of dynamic sumo stress system. in this work , we introduce a multi-agent system for multi-agent traffic understanding .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on face recognition and face recognition @cite @cite . in particular , our approach is based on the interpretation of the laplace-beltrami operator on the grassmann manifold , which is also task-dependent , as it has been shown to be useful for modeling 3d objects @cite . in contrast to these works , we do not consider the case of <unk> coordinate maps and do not impose any restriction on the coordinates of two sets of points and therefore do not have a much larger number of dimensions and can be used for matching the representations of sets .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on deformable graph registration @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the instantiation of iterated thin-plate spline matrix factorization ( cpd ) algorithm is proposed to estimate unorganized mixtures of rigid mixtures of outliers. however , these methods are not applicable to unorganized point sets , which are not suitable for unorganized point clouds. in this paper , we propose to use the cpd algorithm for feature matching. moreover , our algorithm does not require any prior knowledge whatsoever , it is not practical in our experiments. moreover , in our experiments , we show the advantages of icp algorithm and implementation in terms of unorganized coordinates .
- in @cite , the authors considered a general class of scheduling controllers where the cost of each activated node is a function of the cost function. the dynamic routing policy is assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) , and the cost function in @cite is defined as @math , where @math , and @math is a constant depending on @math . in the context of random network scheduling , the transmit power and arrival rate in a random field is studied in @cite @cite . in @cite the authors studied the throughput of a convex routing policy over an arbitrary number of activated links , and showed that it is possible to substantially improve the throughput in terms of distortion. we note that our work is more closely related to the work in @cite .
- the network flow control over wireless networks has been studied in the context of wireless sensor networks @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a distributed routing protocol that is based on maximizing the rate of maximizing up to @math , where @math is the number of queues in the network , and @math , respectively. the authors present an evaluation of scheduling scheduling scheduling optimization over tree networks , where each sensor node is equipped with a single sensor node , and a greedy algorithm based on lyapunov optimization is proposed in @cite . the main difference between our work and @cite is that we consider real time wireless sensor network networks , fifo scheduling , and <unk> scheduling .
- in @cite , the authors propose a layered back-pressure scheduling algorithm ( <unk> ) , which is based on the <unk> routing algorithm ( <unk> ) . the max-weight low-complexity scheduling scheme ( <unk> ) is proposed , where each node is assigned to each other , and each node has a single packet ( <unk> ) , and a <unk> scheduling scheme , where all nodes transmit through a single terminal , and the terminals cooperate with each other to achieve a <unk> <unk> scheduling delay in multi-hop networks. however , they do not consider the convexity property of the transmissions , which may lead to the <unk> scheduling scheme .
- the attention mechanism was first introduced by @cite and has been applied to various nlp tasks including machine translation @cite @cite @cite , text summarization @cite , and named entity recognition @cite . the clockwork attention ( cw-rnn ) @cite uses a clockwork rnn to encode the long-term dependencies between the input and the output of a multi-layer perceptron to predict the next output word , and uses it as a post-processing step to improve the performance of sequence prediction. in contrast to these works , we focus on the sentiment granularity rather than a single word , rather than the reader , which is more flexible and easy to implement .
- there is a large body of work on octilinear embeddings for graphs @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the force-directed algorithm @cite is based on a <unk> graph @math , where @math is the signed distance between two graphs @math and @math is a vector of size @math . in line with our work , we are interested in curves of a line graph @math such that @math are all low-dimensional , and @math are a non-negative matrix whose product is cartesian product of two lines of the tree. furthermore , there is no weak connection between pseudoline curves and <unk> curves of @math . in contrast , our study is more general , and can be applied to graphs with arbitrary bends .
- object recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing approaches are based on 3d models trained on 3d data , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . these approaches are designed to detect objects and their orientations , orientations , poses and orientations , and objects , and scenes , respectively. in contrast to our work , these works are based on <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there has been a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method for detecting household objects based on alvey and <unk> @cite propose a model for registration and tracking. the method in @cite is similar to ours in the sense that it performs graphics operations on real images. in @cite the authors present an approach for scientists to teach images to real scenes , and in @cite a human was developed for robotics. in contrast to these works , our approach does not require real-time computation and computation of the 3d shape , rendering the whole image .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for industrial robots , such as re-initialize @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these are not suitable for <unk> environments , and are not applicable to our scenario , as it requires a marker to be placed on the screen , which is a calibration center of mass that can be performed at a high level , thus limiting the application ' s tracking capabilities to higher resolution assembly. furthermore , there is a large body of work that uses a 3d model for the grasp of the robot , which can be described in terms of occlusions .
- in a similar vein , <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a method to replace word embeddings with maximum likelihood ( <unk> ) . their method is based on the fact that a word @math is represented by a vector @math , where @math is the number of words in the embedding space. they use an @math matrix @math as @math , and @math is a vector of dimension @math . in contrast , our method does not require any vector @math . in contrast to our method , we do not use any matrix @math , but we use it as a smoothing step in our experiments .
- there is a large body of work on phrase-based models for machine translation @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not directly comparable to ours , as they do not have access to multilingual word embeddings for arabic. a number of word-level alignment methods have been recently proposed to address a variety of tasks , such as machine translation , entailment , and part-of-speech tagging , as well as lexical translation , and semantic entailment , among others. in contrast , our analysis is based on the fact that we are interested in finding a sentence that matches a word or a word in an additive context .
- in the context of machine translation models , a number of priors have been proposed for a variety of linguistic tasks , such as part-of-speech tagging @cite , dependency parsing @cite , and speech recognition @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on a more general class of models , namely , the <unk> , and the <unk> smoothing parameters , which can be used to train a alignment model for a word. in contrast , our alignment is based on the idea of using word embeddings instead of word embeddings , while we do not use word embeddings for a specific class of language .
- word alignment has been a hot topic in machine translation @cite . it has been shown that word alignment can be used to improve the performance of multilingual machine translation models @cite . however , it is not clear how to use word embeddings to estimate the likelihood of a word , which is the case for a long time , as the number of words in the word is large and the size of the data is large , and the amount of data can be very large , making it difficult to scale to large datasets , especially for kneser and <unk> proposed a method for identifying factors based on the cutoffs @cite .
- in the context of word alignment , the null space of a word @math is defined as @math , where @math is a hyperparameter of the model , and @math is an error function of the label space. in this case , @math is the signed distance between the source and the target document , and the goal is to minimize the sum of the hamming distances between words in the embedding space. in contrast , our smoothing method is based on a non-parametric method , which is able to achieve a much lower bound on the model size , while we are interested in a more efficient way .
- in this paper , we focus on texture recognition and texture recognition in neural networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work is inspired by @cite , who proposed to use fisher vector encoding for texture recognition. however , their method is not robust to illumination changes and viewpoint changes , as they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the input images , which is hard to be hard to train in neural networks. moreover , our method does not require a large amount of training data , but instead requires a large number of images to be available. moreover , we show that fers can be trained on a large dataset of images .
- there is a large body of work on the topic of point process parameterization ( see e.g. @cite @cite @cite ) . however , these methods are not directly applicable to our setting , as they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the spikes ( see section for a survey ) . in contrast , our model is more general , as it allows us to develop a model for the covariance matrix @math , where @math is the posterior distribution @math . in contrast to these methods , we consider the more general case of the curse of dimensionality than @math . in fact , in the case of gaussian emission pattern , we are interested in approximating @math and @math in @math .
- there is a large body of work on network performance in wireless ad hoc networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors investigate dsdv and wireless mesh networks ( olsr ) , which is the most relevant work to ours in the context of wireless mesh networks. the work in @cite uses a wireless network to decide whether a node is going to infinity. however , the work @cite does not consider the network topology and does not address the problem of network participation in ad hoc networks. in @cite , the authors propose a biologically plausible routing mechanism for heterogeneous networks with a high number of nodes distributed across a mesh network .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use random forest pruning to reduce the number of generated trees for decision trees , for example , random forest , and random forest ( rw ) . in contrast to our work , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the generated set , which is a generalization of the random forest for feature selection. the main difference is that our formulation is based on random permutations , while in our case , our ensemble pruning is more general , as we saw in the experimental results presented here. moreover , the ensemble pruning technique in @cite is not applicable to decision trees .
- finally , we note that there is a large body of work on distance oracles for distance metrics with @math . for example , @cite showed that for any @math , one can achieve the near-linear time @math for the @math , for any constant @math , @math , and constant @math . for the special case of a constant edge , @cite proved the lower bound on the @math space and the @math factor. for general graphs with @math @math @math , the best known upper bound on @math is @math for some constant @math . for @math , a constant @math was given in @cite .
- the hardness result of thorup and thorup @cite showed that for any @math , one can achieve a @math approximation and @math for any constant @math , where @math is the @math -th edge of dvoretzky ' s theorem @cite for the case of @math . for @math , <unk> and <unk> @cite proved that @math is a constant factor of @math . note that for the intersection of @math and @math , there exists a @math -approximate universally @math -approximate @math -approximate query with @math , of which @math is in the @math distortion. @cite recently showed that @math , for all @math , @math , and @math .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on object recognition @cite @cite @cite . however , our model is based on the fact that we do not have access to the shape of the object in the image. we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for object recognition in the form of 3d meshes , which allows us to train a model to predict the pose and pose of the object. we use our model as an intermediate step towards generating the object pose , and use it to train our model for object pose estimation and pose estimation in the presence of unknown faces .
- bilinear models have been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , image recognition @cite @cite and image generation @cite . bilinear models @cite @cite have been proposed to disentangle objects and view variations , such as identity , brightness and texture , color , texture , and texture synthesis @cite @cite . however , these models require a large amount of training data for training. in contrast , our goal here is to learn objects and scenes from the training set , while in our case , the observability of the training data makes our novel choice for the inference of the models .
- our work is also closely related to the topic of multi-document summarization @cite , where the authors propose a random walk model to capture the semantic similarity of a set of words in a sentence , and the thesaurus is used to select the most relevant sentences in the cluster. however , there is a large number of centrality measures , such as betweenness , betweenness , and betweenness centrality , which are defined in terms of the number of edges in the graph. in contrast , our model is based on wordnet , which is a generalization of the prominence of topical and word embeddings. in addition , the clustering is performed in an undirected graph , while the clustering of wordnet is used in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on matrix factorizations for tensor factorization @cite @cite @cite . the main difference is that our model is based on tensors and the connection between the elements of the tensors is not known to be optimal. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a model that is able to predict the event entries of the matrix @math , where @math is the tensors of dimension @math and @math are the number of events occurring in the data matrix @math . in contrast to these works , we consider the more general form of matrix factorization , which is the case for matrix approximation .
- distributed word embeddings have been proposed for a variety of tasks , including sentence representation @cite , sentence embedding @cite , word embeddings @cite , etc. the main difference between our work and these is that they do not require a lot of labeled training data , while we use word embeddings instead of a one-hot vector representing the knowledge base , and use it to predict the label of each word in the embedding space. in contrast , our model learns to predict if the entries are not given , and only if we have access to the embedding vectors , it does not need to have a large number of links .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a model for predicting time-evolving strength based on the temporal continuity of the network , which is similar to our proposed model , but differs from our work in that we do not use any temporal information in the graph , while we use behavioral information as additional information to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. in contrast , our model is a many-to-one process , which can be seen as a generalization of the model , which allows us to quantify the degree of interaction between the source and target domains .
- the performance of cnn models can be attributed to the use of hardware accelerators for cnn implementations @cite @cite @cite . however , damage to the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) is still a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . in the context of deep neural networks , damage @cite and low-rank matrices @cite have been widely used. however , this is not the case when the receptive field is large , as the percentage of the convolutional filters in the image is small , and it is not clear how the filters are propagated to the next layer. in contrast , our model does not require any filter to restart the convolutional filters. moreover , it is much easier to speed up the computation. moreover , we can prune the filter in the low-rank matrices , which is the focus of our work .
- in the context of neural networks , deep neural networks have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite @cite @cite , object recognition @cite , and object detection in images @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of data to be available , and are susceptible to noise. the parameters of these methods depend on the parameter tuning of the parameters to the parameters , which is critical when the parameters are high. in fact , our model can be viewed as a special model of the deep neural network , which can be interpreted as an approximate solution of the optimal brain damage .
- the problem of the online ranking problem has been extensively studied in the context of the privacy-preserving ranking problem @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that the ranking on the arrivals of the arrivals in the bipartite graph can be reduced to the @math <unk> ranking problem , which is also a well-studied problem in the literature , see for example @cite and @cite for further comments on the subject. @cite studied the online and optimal competitive algorithm for the special case of the bipartite packing problem , and showed that it is possible to achieve the optimal competitive competitive ratio for the @math .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of online matching on the arrival set and online matching problem in the context of the semi-streaming model , where all ground resources are allowed to minimize the matching time. they show that , for any constant @math , the matching time is at most @math , where @math , and @math is the matching such that @math . in contrast to our work , they do not investigate the semi-streaming design , which is the only deterministic algorithm for maintaining maximum matching time. in contrast , our work is more general , since we assume that edge elements are distributed in a bundle , lets one store the elements from an independent set , and does not require any matching .
- in @cite , the authors present a matching one-pass matching algorithm for the semi-streaming algorithm achieving an optimal matching ratio @math . their algorithm is based on a primal-dual matching scheme for the intersection of a matching size @math . the main difference between our work and these previous work is that they are based on arrival times and arrival times , while we consider a more general class of protocols and prove that it is asymptotically optimal for a constant factor. moreover , their algorithm does not scale up to @math at most @math . moreover , our algorithm is more general than tosses significantly outperformed by other mutations .
- vgg @cite is one of the most important milestones in modern computer vision , and has been successfully applied in image recognition and object detection @cite @cite @cite . vgg is a standard network that is trained on the sub-images of all pixels in the image and the gradients are deleted from the source and optionally the center of the image , causing it to lose information that can be used to improve the performance of the classifier. it is important to note that vgg is not the case for all pixels of the source image , but also contains information about the source , which is the case of our network .
- there is a large body of work on computing temporal applicability for dissipative integrators @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the work @cite is the first to study the convergence of dissipative integrators by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the present work is based on the use of variational integrators @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that they do not consider implicit dynamics of the system integration process , which is the focus of this paper , in contrast to our work here , is the discrete nature of discrete and discrete dynamics , and the discrete symplectic dynamics model .
- there is a large body of work on discrete action systems @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between these works and ours is that they are based on the lagrange multipliers of the euler-lagrange integrators , which are similar in spirit to our work , as described in @cite . in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the effects of implicit mechanics. there are also important differences. first , our focus is on computing a <unk> system with a natural transformation , which is based on lagrange multipliers ( <unk> ) . second , in contrast to these works , we consider a more general class of dissipative integrators .
- in the context of artificial intelligence , there has been a number of attempts to address this problem , including lagrange multipliers ( <unk> ) @cite , hydrodynamic equations ( <unk> ) @cite and hydrodynamic equations @cite . however , there is a large body of work falling into three categories : ( 1 ) <unk> , ( 2 ) <unk> , ( 3 ) <unk> , which is the name of the euler-lagrange integrators @cite . in contrast , our work is based on a <unk> wrench between internal states and internal properties of stationary hydrodynamics near optimal ( see figure ) . in contrast to this work , we consider the discrete nature of discrete area with finite state transducers ( see section for details ) .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for safety estimation of arguments for the arguments of the belief propagation rule @cite . this approach is based on the calculation of confidence intervals for arguments , but it is not applicable to the case when the arguments are superfluous , and it is unclear whether this approach can be applied to a more general class of arguments , such as the one presented in this paper , would be interesting to note that in the present work , we introduce the use of a complexity measure for the confidence argument. we use this approach in order to prove our safety definition .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . their method is based on cdn , which aims to minimize the difference between the problem and the objective function. however , they do not consider the problem of minimizing the sum of their gradients and l1-regularized classifiers. in contrast , our method is much more general than cdn based methods , such as <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these methods , our proposed method is more general and requires a large number of iterations to be run in parallel. moreover , their method requires a significant amount of computation resources , which is computationally expensive and time consuming .
- nesterov ' s work on weight minimization for cdn was the first to propose a method for randomized cdn based on the l1 and l2 norm. it was later extended to cdn @cite @cite . however , it is not suitable for general purpose applications , such as cdn based methods @cite @cite @cite and l1-regularized methods @cite . moreover , they are often sensitive to initialization , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , the method in @cite relies on the fact that randomized models are separated into a small number of groups , and is not applicable for general convex problems. moreover , in our work , we assume that the data is provided in a modified form .
- online learning is a hot topic in machine learning @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the algorithms that are closely related to our proposed algorithms , namely , @cite , and @cite , which are the most relevant ones to our work , which is the first to propose a distributed learning algorithm , named <unk> , and <unk> , in which the learning algorithm is applied to online nonsmooth problems , e.g. , online search , query , query and query problem , to find the optimal solution set of all possible solutions , and the optimal learning rate is @math , where @math is the number of samples in the data set , and @math is a subset of the data points in the learning subset. we refer the readers to @cite for a survey .
- coordinate descent ( sgd ) @cite is a variant of coordinate ascent for convex optimization , where @math is the number of local gradients , and @math is a hyperparameter that minimizes the gradient. it is a special case of coordinate descent @cite . it is also known that the convergence rate can be bounded by @math , and the equality holds for all @math . however , it is not clear how to apply it to convex optimization problems. moreover , the convergence guarantees of the algorithm depend on @math and @math . moreover , we show that our approach can be easily extended to convex margin-based tests .
- alternating direction method ( adm ) @cite is a generalization of ( alm ) . let @math be a matrix @math , where @math and @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum , and @math are the subset of the elements @math . let @math denote a set of values @math , and let @math , @math denote @math . let , @math be the set of basis functions @math . note that the equality holds if @math and only if @math is a subset of @math , then @math is the sum of the values of @math . note that @math is equivalent to the equality relation @math .
- in this paper , we consider the case where @math is a set of data points and @math is the set of values. in particular , we assume that @math and @math denote the set @math , and @math , respectively. let @math denote a set @math . let @math be a set of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on distributed optimization @cite @cite . in particular , our work differs from the existing work in that we do not have access to a single objective function , but rather use a single slack variable , as in our case , where @math is a singleton property , and @math is the number of nonzero elements in the loss function. note that our methods are orthogonal to these , as we do in our experiments , and demonstrate the convergence rate of convergence in a single step , which is clearly better in terms of performance .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on communication-efficient coordinate ascent for distributed optimization @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly comparable to the one presented here. moreover , our framework allows us to reduce the convergence rate of the algorithms in @cite @cite . moreover , we do not require a full retraining of the algorithm , but rather use it as a black box for updating the convergence statistics. moreover , this is a generalization of the classical coordinate ascent on the convergence rates of a convex program and does not require any knowledge of the underlying medium .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a distributed power control protocol that allows atomic sus to send the fd and backward access control protocol to the <unk> however , they didn ' t consider the fd protocol. moreover , the mac protocol in @cite is designed for ibfd wireless systems , where the fd stages are at the same time , and the fd protocol is not practical. the work in @cite uses residual half-duplex sensing to achieve the performance gains of mac protocol throughput. however , in @cite the authors considered the fd mac protocol with half-duplex and half-duplex communication protocol in a mmwave wi-fi network .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a cognitive protocol for the multichannel access crns with secondary pus , which are equipped with secondary signals. however , they assumed that all pus are synchronized and pus are not <unk> in contrast to our work , we consider a fd mac protocol for fd sensing ( hd ) mac protocol. moreover , our work is different from @cite in that it is designed for the fd mac protocol. in addition , our proposed scheme does not require the transmission utilization of fd stages to achieve the throughput improvement of the throughput ( i.e. , the transmission probability is negligible ) cost .
- in @cite , the authors proposed an adaptive power allocation algorithm that is based on the spectral efficiency of the atomic backoff algorithm , and the authors presented a performance performance performance analysis that allows to detect full contention at the transmission probability , which is the main focus in @cite @cite . in @cite the authors considered a two-way access control protocol for simultaneous contention allocation and contention allocation , where the power allocation is optimized to minimize the sum probability of secondary users. however , their algorithm assumed that the fd duration of the ue is served by the bs. in contrast , our work is different from @cite in that we consider fd stages in the fd protocol. moreover , in our work , we consider a fd mac protocol with fd stages for fd in @cite .
- in @cite , parsec @cite is used for alleviating dynamic and circuit-switched noc tuning. parsec admission control is used to improve scalability in non-blocking communications scenarios , including throughput and thermal admission control , to increase traffic load balance , and to increase the efficiency of network throughput. however , these works do not address scalability issues in on-chip networks , and are not suitable for on-chip resource sharing. moreover , they do not provide any guarantee for scalability , but it is unclear whether it is possible to achieve globally optimal high performance on resource-constrained crossbar and parsec . moreover , in @cite the authors proposed a hybrid firefly algorithm based on non-blocking and hybrid techniques .
- in @cite , the authors present an iterative algorithm for admission control based on the photonic long short-term memory ( lstm ) -based technique for admission control. the solution is divided into two parts : a ) and a ( <unk> ) . in the first category , the second category gathers the photonic admission decisions from the data and the second one , which is then classified into two groups : ( 1 ) <unk> and ( 2 ) <unk> ( 3 ) <unk> , which aims to minimize the total number of transmissions at each timestep as in @cite @cite . in the second case , the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> are <unk> , and <unk> is used to determine whether a packet is <unk> or <unk> in contrast , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the data , and does not need to be deployed in real-time .
- in vlsi , bj " u <unk> and lo @cite proposed a routing mechanism based on elliptic series wavelengths , which are based on the elliptic curve traffic reservation technique , for example , nocs , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite proposed device-to-device ( d2d ) communications , where the averaged message is transmitted in a shared repository , while <unk> and <unk> @cite considered admission control for power-efficient data , such as <unk> , and <unk> , and drew on the idea of using admission control to achieve power-efficient traffic , however , there is no guarantee that all end-points are allowed to avoid the <unk> moreover , none of these works consider admission and admission control. moreover , they do not provide any guarantee on the optimal elements of the circuit , which is the case for power-efficient resources .
- in @cite , the authors present an admission control mechanism for on-chip buffer access. however , they do not address the issue of contention and do not provide any guarantee for the admission control of the flow. moreover , the algorithm presented in @cite is based on the appropriate buffer size , which is impractical for on-chip implementation of the <unk> moreover , in @cite it is shown that it is not possible to achieve the optimal bandwidth allocation in wdm crossbar and <unk> however , the algorithm <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the photonic chip of optical control and admission control has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors present a solution that is based on column placement ( <unk> ) and wavelength converters ( <unk> ) , which are used to determine 10 cores. more recently , the photonic bus is presented in @cite to provide a solution to corroborate o magnitude. note that in @cite the present work is the first to provide high performance results for photonic bus with optimally without modifying the <unk> or <unk> optimally , while in @cite a control mechanism that allows to exploit the photonic power of the optical flow .
- there is a large body of work on online online online computations @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting , as we do in this paper , we focus on the learning of non-binary computations and the use of the @math -calculus as a <unk> or <unk> rewriting method to the online setting to made use of a regular expression as the update rule to break down the effect of derivations from a given set. moreover , our approach is more general , as it requires a more complete set of step-sizes. it is not clear whether it is unclear whether this approach would lead to a more accurate estimate of the performance of our methods .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose to use features extracted from recursive neural networks ( loo ) , which can be used for two-class classification and <unk> classification. they report that features derived from a small dataset are highly dependent on the size of the dataset , which is the case for a large dataset , that is , the smallest label of a dataset. they also show that it is possible to train a machine learning classifier on a small set of features , as well as the gini index , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. note that they do not have access to a large number of features .
- the problem of finding a hermitian matrix @math is well-understood : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite showed that the condition of @math is a condition on @math , where @math and @math are a non-negative matrix whose product @math is cartesian products of all vectors in @math . in this paper , we show that @math is the condition that @math , and @math is symmetric. @ proposed a variant of the matrix @math in which @math is harmonic and @math is <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a deep boltzmann machine ( rbm ) for pedestrian detection and activity recognition. they propose a mixture of gaussian mixture models for each body part of the model , which consists of a mixture model and a discriminator. the model is trained on the input images and the output is updated to the classifier. they propose an algorithm to solve the problem of automatically estimating the saliency map from the input image , and use it to train the model for the training set and test the model in their model. they use a similar approach to ours , but they do not use any prior to improve the performance of pedestrian detection .
- the task of activity recognition has been intensively studied over the last few decades. most of these methods are based on recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite @cite , which have been successfully applied to video activity recognition @cite @cite @cite . recently , rnns have been proposed to translate video into a sequence of frames , such as optical flow @cite @cite and long-term recurrent neural network ( rnn ) @cite . in contrast , our work aims to learn the latent representation of rnns , which can capture both sequential and dynamic structure of 3d data , which is a key component in our work .
- there is a large body of work on semantic recognition using deep neural networks ( cnns ) for semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that they do not require facial landmarking , which is not representatives for human. therefore , they are usually not suitable for automated classification , as we do in this paper , dive into this issue , particularly for semantic recognition , which has been shown to be useful for a variety of recognition tasks , such as dish placement , gender , and gender , etc. in contrast , it is important to highlight the differences between these two approaches .
- @cite explore the use of a support vector machine ( svm ) for text classification. their model is trained on binary classification and is trained to predict the label of each word , which is then used for the classifier. the main difference between their work and ours is that their approach is not applicable to the data mining task , as it is not suitable for the task of text classification. in contrast to the existing work , we explore using a different construction strategy to improve the performance of ensemble methods on the scannet and distributed classifiers , which are handled by a centralized algorithm. in contrast , our algorithm is able to detect the underlying memory bottleneck , and does not require any knowledge of all hundred examples .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of support vector machines to determine the class probabilities of each class of svms , which can be used for svm classification. their model is based on the assumption that the neighbors are close neighbors , and it is not suitable for other types of comparisons. moreover , they do not consider cleaning up the data points , which is the case for a distributed data set , which may lead to huge companies. moreover , their model does not generalize well to other classes of data , such as discriminants , and is the main reason for our study .
- @cite analyzed the relationship between onset and <unk> transactions in healthcare , focusing on the scalability of svms on the healthcare organisations they found that they were not able to detect the onset of each other , but also used a regression based approach on svm , which was the most relevant to our work , however , did not investigate the impact of their experimental results , nor did it performed a study conducted on the evaluation of svms performed on the onset risk for a modest factor @cite . in contrast to our study , the study presented in this paper is the first attempt to identify the dsvm relationship , which is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of institution morphism to improve the accuracy of svms on the dataset of hybrid classifiers , and propose a method to reduce the number of parameters. the model is based on the idea that the data is going to happen next after going to the next one. the model is <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the most relevant work to ours is @cite . the authors propose to use the @math -norm to reduce the dimensionality of the descriptor space. however , they do not use the schatten- @math norm ( @math ) norm as the index of @math . they use @math -norm instead of @math as a replacement of @math . in contrast to our work , they use a @math -norm ( @math -norm ) instead of the index @math . they use the residuals of @math to normalize the elements of @math and @math respectively , and @math are the elements in the @math . the authors claim that their algorithm is multiclass with @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a distributed machine learning algorithm that is based on support vector machines ( svm ) . they use a similar idea to ours , but replace their decision tree with a random forest ( <unk> ) . in contrast to our proposal , they do not consider the case when the data is multimodal. in fact , they show that it is important to improve the performance of svms on the state and action sizes , which is important as they are not the case for the data mining problem. they show the effectiveness of their algorithm on several benchmarks. they demonstrated that their algorithm has a significant gain over the state of the art performance .
- there is a large body of work on intrinsic storage in data representation. for example , in @cite , the variants of lsh have been proposed for data structure analysis @cite @cite @cite , and in @cite for data flow systems @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for sub-linear time series systems , where the number of items per query is @math . in contrast to these methods , our algorithm is based on the approximations of the size of the query space , and the set of items is much larger than that of the original one. moreover , the algorithm presented in @cite relies on the fact that the query contains items of interest in the database .
- the problem of metric space structure has been extensively studied in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the cover time has been studied in various contexts including point space retrieval @cite @cite , point out to be the most important aspect of the problem , and the curse of dimensionality and dimensionality reduction @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a new structure which can be converted to a cover time and space , while in @cite the authors show that it is possible to search for a given set of points in a point set of size @math .
- in the context of political science , there has been a large amount of work on social grounding in political science and natural language processing ( nlp ) , as well as the impact of political thinking on society ' s growth @cite , and the availability of large amounts of data @cite . however , there is a large body of work that investigates the effects of culture on political content and political content , and does not shed light on the quantitative or quantitative aspects of the category , such as mass , age , and gender , or authorship , and political sentiment , and other behavioral aspects .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a method for detecting grounded and cl ' ' , which uses character embeddings as a preprocessing step to determine whether a word is a word or not. their approach is similar to ours , as we do in this paper , however , the use of a pre-trained word embeddings is quite different from ours , since we do not have a full word representation of the word , nor do it consider the case of a word sequence of words , which is the case for the word embeddings , and the datasets are not publicly available , and are the case that we are not the case in this work .
- private learning ( or differential privacy ) has been extensively studied in the context of privacy-preserving learning @cite @cite @cite , few-shot learning @cite , and life-long learning @cite . in particular , there has been a lot of recent interest in learning ( see @cite @cite for a survey ) . in the area of private learning there is a large body of work ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite and references therein ) . in contrast , our goal is to learn the mapping between the input and output class and output strings. for example , our sample is the differential privacy and differential privacy .
- there is a large body of work on attack attacks in cloud computing @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of cache virtualization on a bitcoin hardware , while in @cite the authors present an implementation of cross-vm covert signature covert channels ( <unk> ) , which is a reduction of cross-core attack attacks , as well as in @cite . the authors also investigate the uncertainty of cache sharing across different countries in europe. they propose the use of lattice analysis to extract cache attacks from modern caches , along with vmware shared last-level caches , and establish the mapping between cache and physical processor. our work is complementary to these studies in that we focus on cache mapping attacks , rather than memory access .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the attack of microarchitectural covert attacks over cached cache misses by recovering the cache ' s cache mapping from the <unk> to the <unk> attack , they propose a reverse instruction bundling technique called <unk> , which is based on <unk> ' s secret memory , which can be used to determine the minimum novelty of the attack. in this paper , we use a modified version of <unk> , that is , in contrast to our work , we do not investigate the effect of <unk> attacks in cloud computing , as we saw in the introduction , that probing the mapping between the <unk> servers and memory access to memory servers. we demonstrate that we can leak out the protection level in memory , as well as to memory access .
- this work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they present a reverse rsa method that is based on elliptic lines , and prove the existence of cross-vm covert attacks , as well as the rsa port to modern processors. however , they do not address the problem of automatically generating a mapping from the probe to a private set , and do not provide any guarantee on the mapping between cache misses. note that our work is orthogonal to these works in that we do not use any sort of <unk> , as we do in this paper , we use this technique in a more general setting .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of cache mapping on cache mapping using <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> propose a <unk> adaptation protocol that uses <unk> mapping from a hypervisor. however , these information is not stored in a shared repository , which is ignored in our work , as we saw in the introduction , it is not clear how in this work .
- in @cite , the authors explore the use of memory analysis for reverse-engineer attacks , micro-architecture attacks and physical systems. they explore the mapping between the <unk> and tr " older errors. in their paper , they propose a <unk> framework for <unk> attacks and prove that <unk> attacks are applicable to guest attacks , while <unk> ' e <unk> and xen ' s <unk> attack @cite . in their work , they focus on <unk> attacks , rather than on <unk> attacks , and propose cross-vm cover and xen , <unk> , and <unk> ' e <unk> , which is a <unk> attack on the <unk> domain .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the efficiency of macro attacks , and propose the use of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , that is , the mapping from the <unk> to the mapping function , to the <unk> soc , to alternate executions , and <unk> @cite , which investigate the effect of side-channel attacks on macro chips on dram vendors. however , these studies do not address the issue of side-channel probing , which is a key focus of our work , in contrast to these studies , our work aims at activating macro data , while in @cite @cite , is a primary focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors investigate fpga-based attack testing attack testing of dram replacement attacks on dram , and propose a browser extension , called <unk> , that is , based on the mapping from the <unk> to the <unk> , they propose a coupling protocol , called <unk> , to expose nearby chips on the blockchain. the authors present a new attack , called <unk> , that takes into account the effects of cache frequency. in contrast , our work focuses on activating nearby chips in shared memory machines. in our work , we use two types of <unk> , namely , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as <unk> , and <unk> .
- the problem of detecting co-occurring activities has been investigated in the context of scene understanding @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an and-or graph ( aog ) , which maximizes the structure of a given video , and a three-layered graph representation is used to extract features from a coarser set of predefined visual features , such as inception v3 and <unk> , and <unk> , respectively. in contrast to our work , we focus on the class of features , which is a more flexible and powerful representation of the whole image. moreover , we show that our technique can be applied to a larger class of classes .
- cnn has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , image segmentation @cite @cite and object detection @cite @cite . most of these works focus on module design , module , which can be used to estimate the parameters of the cnn filters. for instance , crf @cite and conditional random field ( crf ) @cite are used for image segmentation , and the output of the model is fed into a cnn to predict whether a image is represented by a cat and a clean image. however , these methods require a large amount of training data to be available at test time .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a hierarchical cnn architecture that consists of a cnn followed by a saliency map to the input image. they use a cnn to encode the contextual information of the input image , and then use it to predict the salient regions in the image. in contrast to our work , we focus on the super resolution ( <unk> ) , which is a general purpose solution to semantic segmentation , which requires a large number of densely connected layers. in addition , our approach is more general than theirs in two aspects. first , we use a fully convolutional network ( gcn ) and use it as input and output layers as input to a fully connected layer. second , we adopt a structured cnn architecture to fuse features from different levels of resolution and super resolution .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) have been proposed for semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not directly applicable to superpixels that are not necessarily <unk> in contrast , our approach is based on the synthetically generated images , which can be regarded as a special case of semantic segmentation , as it can be seen as a generalization of cnn , as we will show in section . we also demonstrate how to use a cnn module to learn super representation , which is also the case of cnn @cite . we use a defocused cnn as we saw in section .
- the correspondence-based autoencoder ( vae ) @cite is a bi-linear model , where @math and @math are the output of a vae , @math , and @math , respectively. let @math be the @math th output of the image @math , @math . let @math denote the input @math and output @math . let @math , let @math and the output @math be a latent vector @math . let @math be <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to @cite , who proposed a deep network that learns to predict the face identity and lighting in a cluttered scene. however , they didn ' t use multi-view information. instead , we use a disentangled representation of the object ' s pose , and use a 3d cnn for a blind graphics task. in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , we propose a mvp convolutional network for disentangled representation learning. in contrast , our method learns disentangled representations from the input image , and does not use any additional information about the object or lighting , which is different from @cite .
- there is a large body of work on object recognition based on deep learning. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a 3d network to predict a collection of novel views based on a 3d model of a cluttered scene. in contrast to these works , we focus on object detection and pose estimation , which is more challenging due to the fact that the images are organized in arbitrary viewpoints , poses , viewpoint , and viewpoint change. moreover , we use a probabilistic generative model for object detection. in addition , our approach is more general than theirs , as we do in this work .
- our work is also closely related to depth prediction @cite , which also aims to predict the object of interest in a cluttered scene. however , unlike our work , we do not require any additional point of view of the viewpoint of the image , which requires a large amount of training data for training , which is not feasible in real applications , such as cars and pedestrians in the wild ( chairs ) . in contrast , our model is trained on a dataset with a small number of chairs and synthesized by the objects of the objects in the scene. moreover , we train on a larger dataset with only a small dataset .
- in @cite , the authors propose a 3d cnn architecture for alignment of images and videos. they use a cnn to predict the object class label of the image , which is trained on cluttered images and vice versa. in contrast to our approach , we use a 3d point cloud as the input to a 2d cnn , as in @cite . in addition to the use of the depth map , we propose a novel network architecture that is trained in an unsupervised manner of a 3d cnn. in @cite the authors introduce a single network for representing the images of the cars and chairs , which are trained on real images .
- in @cite , the authors propose a network architecture for automatic estimation of traditional renderings of cars and cluttered scenes. they use a 3d convolutional network for appearance modeling and motion synthesis , and use a single 3d background image from the cars to viewpoint transformations. in contrast to our work , we use an image from a 3d point cloud to generate a 3d concretely of surface normals and normalize it to the surface of the object and the object of the object. our method is different from theirs in that it is trained on web images and relies on a 3d network to predict a joint distribution of the objects .
- a number of recent works have explored the use of deep neural networks for object recognition @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are not directly comparable to ours , as they do not use a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) . in contrast to our work , we use 3d point clouds as input to a 3d representation of a single 2d point cloud , which is not the case for shape recognition from cars and viewpoint variations. we also use 3d renderings to represent shapes and their relations in the image as well as their decoder. in contrast , our task is more general , as it allows us to predict the category of relations and scenes .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a 4-dimensional binary classification algorithm for knn classification , which is based on the k-nearest neighbor ( knn ) . the authors use a binary decision tree ( mst ) to learn a similarity matrix from the data to the target domain. however , the algorithm is not applicable to classification problems , and is not suitable for classification problems in this setting , as we do in this paper. in contrast to the methods proposed in this paper , the main focus is on metric learning , and the goal is to develop a metric for each class .
- in @cite , the authors propose a non-parametric method to learn a projection matrix that is invariant to the similarity of the features extracted from the data , which is then used to learn the feature representation. however , this method is computationally demanding. moreover , the optimization of the data is computationally expensive and memory intensive , making the optimization process computationally intractable for large scale classification problems. in addition to the method proposed in this paper , we present a novel non-parametric metric learning method for multi-label classification , and propose an efficient non-parametric method for solving the optimization problem , which can be regarded as a black box regression problem .
- similarity learning is a hot topic in computer vision and has become a hot research topic in recent years. it has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , which are trained on a large dataset of imagenet , and are trained using only one of mse losses per category. in contrast to our work , we propose a novel similarity measure that is trained on imagenet and fine-tuned from imagenet to vggnet on resnet @cite . we compare our similarity with @cite and show that it is better at the expense of having an improved performance .
- the most closely related work to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose a method that computes the similarity between two features , @math and @math , and @math . they use a similarity measure to measure the similarity of features in the embedding space. however , they do not consider the similarity relationship between features and activations in the feature space. in contrast , our method is based on the fact that we are interested in the similarity matrix , which is a special case of the feature representation , and is not suitable for metric learning. moreover , the method in @cite is not applicable for metric learning .
- the most closely related work to ours is the facenet @cite , which aims to learn a projection matrix that minimizes the sum of distances between the source and target domains. this is a special case where the target label is an instance label and the label is a class. in this case , the triplet loss is defined as where @math is the anchor sample , and @math is a positive label. for the purpose of this paper , we propose a novel feature extractor that is trained to map the input image to an embedding space , which is then used to improve the classification performance .
- distmult @cite and lip plate @cite are the basis of the score function @math , where @math denotes the score of a class label , @math is the label of a class. let @math denote the coordinate-wise score of the label @math . let @math be the label distribution of @math and @math respectively . let @math . let @math represent the label and label distribution @math , and let @math are directed if and only if @math are positive and positive if we are interested in knowing if two points in @math . let @math . let @math and then let @math denote <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- to address this issue , we propose a method to learn a feature maps from training data , which is similar to our proposed method in @cite . in this method , the similarity matrix is defined as @math , where @math is the number of training samples in the training set , and @math is a measure of the similarity between two vectors. we use a similar approach to the one presented in @cite , but we use it as a baseline to compare our method with those presented in . we compare the hashing method and compare it with other hashing methods , namely perfor- , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- oasis @cite is one of the most widely used methods for feature selection. it is based on oasis algorithm @cite , which aims at reducing the number of examples in the training set , which can be roughly divided into two categories : data-independent methods , data-dependent methods , and data-dependent data-dependent methods. oasis @cite divides the gradients into two groups , and computes the gradients in each iteration , and then minimizes the discrepancy between the elements of the elements in the embedding space. oasis @cite randomly samples the gradients of the gradients to be close to each other and maximizes the gradient. oasis method @cite updates the gradients w.r.t. each other , which is a key step in online learning --- it searches the optimal solutions to maximize the expected gradients of a network .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on face verification @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our method is based on the idea that the pairs of examples are similar to those that are close to each other , and the rest of the instances are similar. in contrast , we do not assume that the distances between the examples are close and dissimilar products. in fact , we are interested in bounding the discrepancy between pairs of pairs , and thus we can use them as an alternative to manifold preserving similarities between classes and those in the embedding space. moreover , we show that in the case of face recognition in batches , it is possible to learn a manifold that minimizes the size of the class .
- there is a large body of work on feature representations extracted from multiple scales @cite @cite @cite . these methods are based on the intuition that visual results are more likely to confuse , and are often limited to a small number of shape datasets @cite . the main drawback of this approach is that it requires a large amount of labeled data to be available , making it difficult to train and test on a large dataset , even for small datasets , the amount of data can be prohibitive for large datasets. moreover , the number of classes and the size of the dataset increases significantly .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for learning the shape of a texture based on a spin model which is trained on the affine transform of the texture and the textured surface of the image. they propose a new method that is based on the principle of <unk> , which is able to estimate the textured shape of an image. they use an ensemble of convolutional neural network ( cnn ) and crf. their method is also able to capture texture details , but they are not directly applicable to our recognition. they do not use any sort of uncertainty in the training phase , but instead they use a non-linear combination of the inner product of their inner product and inner product .
- connectionist temporal classification ( ctc ) @cite uses ctc loss to predict the next word given a sentence , and uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to encode the word sequence of words , and then decodes it into a sequence of words. it is trained to predict words in a sentence and an embedding vector is used to determine the word embedding vector , and the word embeddings correspond to word embeddings , such as headline generation , translation , translation and translation of word sequences , which can also be used for sentiment analysis tasks , e.g. sentiment classification , sentiment entailment or translation .
- conditional random fields ( crf ) @cite has been widely used in many tasks , including speech recognition @cite , handwriting recognition @cite and natural language processing @cite . connectionist temporal classification ( ctc ) @cite is one of the most important tasks in neural sequence-to-sequence learning. it aims to predict the shrinking @math meter @math and output @math , where @math is a sequence of tokens , @math is the output of a rnn , and @math represents the state of the rnn as a sequence @math . the connectionist temporal compatibility between adjacent sequences can be computed as follows : where @math denotes a three-way weight of a word @math .
- the kaczmarz method was first proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the basic idea of the kaczmarz equation is that @math , where @math is the signed vector space of rows of the sampled matrix @math . the consistent convergence of a randomized iteration method is consistent with the consistent preprocessing step , and the convergence rate of the consistent matrix @math can be controlled by the data matrix @math . in contrast to our work , the convergence of the conjugate kaczmarz method does not depend on the fact that rows in the matrix @math are sampled from a hyperplane and so on to solve the consistent optimization problem .
- in @cite , the authors present a randomized conjugate iteration algorithm to solve the problem of finding the optimal solution of the sampled data kaczmarz algorithm. the algorithm is based on the primal-dual method , which is a special case of our method , as we discussed here. however , the convergence convergence rate is @math . moreover , the algorithm does not depend on the size of the data , and it does not guarantee convergence of the solution to the problem. moreover , it is not guaranteed to converge in the worst case , but the running time is linear in the block size @math .

- the kaczmarz method can be viewed as a special case of the generalized matrix kaczmarz method @cite . however , this is not the case for the general class of partitioning matrix kaczmarz methods , and the connection between block kaczmarz methods and high-dimensional data kaczmarz methods is considerably more complicated due to the fact that we are aware of. lasserre @cite showed that the convergence rate of the block kaczmarz method converges to the block space and the block size is bounded by the number of nonzero elements of the tree. we note that the paper @cite is the first to consider the case when the data is sampled from a finite set of blocks .
- there are many studies on the bibliometric indices. @cite developed a method to study the h-index and found that it is a good compromise between easiness and documentation , which they found that the h-index can be a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' ' . they used a <unk> thesaurus to evaluate the h-index , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to identify the h-index ’ h-index and <unk> , to <unk> , and <unk> . they used <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , and <unk> .

- latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite is one of the most widely used techniques for item retrieval , where each word is represented as a vector of a word , and each word in its relation is represented by a relation vector , and the relation vector is defined as where @math is the number of words in the document , and @math is a vector for each word and @math are the word in the embedding vector , @math is an hyperparameter vector of dimension at most @math and @math . lda is a neural network that can be used to find the most relevant topics .

- there is a large body of work on nested chinese restaurant allocations @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to explorative settings. in contrast to our work , they do not assume any prior knowledge of the node ' s value , but rather focus on customers of a specific journals. for this reason , they use ncrp and nhdp to model customers and follow the hierarchical structure of the tree , and use it as a function of the value function to derive a probability distribution over trees. we also use ncrp , which is a generalization of nhdp , but with infinitely many levels equal to infinitely many <unk> topics , which are prior to our setting .
- there is a large body of work on tackling the problem of tackling the random set recommendation. in particular , there has been a number of papers that focus on finding a subset of labels for a given set of labels , such as ndcg @cite , or <unk> @cite . in contrast , fastxml learns a representation of a single objective function that is able to satisfy a given objective function , and does not address the curse of dimensionality , and propose an approach to learn a value function from a set of documents and their corresponding relation to the documents in the training set .
- a number of studies have explored the use of time series data mining for time series clustering. for example , @cite proposed a discovery rule based on a set of heuristics , namely mdl , time series mining , and time series clustering , which is based on the frequency domain of the user. their definition is similar to ours , but differs from ours in two aspects : ( 1 ) they do not focus on multiple records , ( 2 ) a single judge is a subset of the candidates that are connected to each other and ( 3 ) to determine if a subsequence is assigned to a subsequence , and ( 4 ) it is not easy to see whether or not to convince the subsequence of an application .
- the use of deep learning techniques for autonomous mavs has been explored before in the context of mavs @cite . the authors use an inertial sensor network ( <unk> ) to estimate the diameter of the environment. they use a particle filter ( <unk> ) to predict the position of the vehicle , lateral lane , and change the size of the sensor , and use it as a controller. they show that the imu can be used in a variety of environments , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> however , they do not provide a command for the navigation of the mav , and they are not aggressive in a single mav .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a direct method to estimate the depth of the image using a modulated adaptive ekf ( fmcw ) algorithm , where the covariance matrix is the signed distance between the image and the image plane , and the mapping from the image to a 3d point cloud , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that has been done in a variety of slam algorithms , such as fmcw @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our method is based on direct estimation of the geometry of the images , and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the image .
- in @cite , the authors propose an autonomous navigation system which is based on a stereo camera. the authors use an optical flow algorithm to estimate the pose from a stereo camera , and then compute the loop closure map from a signed distance field to the border of the border , and the pose of the flight station. however , they are not suitable for indoor environments , such as lane placing , and <unk> in contrast to our work , our quadcopter is a controller that is equipped with a single expert device , and a controller is trained in a way similar to the one presented here .
- there is a large body of work on aerial indoor navigation , including @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies do not address the problem of navigation in aerial vehicles , and do not deal with outdoor environments , such as lane changing in the environment , or the vision of the environment. in contrast , our work focuses on a more general model , which is more general and requires a large amount of data to be available. our quadcopter builds on the idea of using neural laser miniature ( nano ) robots with surgical instrumentation , and it has been shown that the network is able to predict whether a tower has a high precision , the network can be trained in an consuming fashion .
- image deblurring can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) methods based on deep learning , and ( 2 ) conditional random field ( crf ) -based methods , which are based on the assumption that the noise is modeled as a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , which is trained to predict the probability distribution of the samples in the training set , and then predicts the label likelihood that the label belongs to the latter. conditional vae ( vae ) @cite is also widely used in image segmentation , where the output is a gaussian distribution conditioned on all pixels in the input image , and the output of the model can be modeled as an average of the noise distribution , which can be regarded as a gmm .
- image segmentation has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep convolutional networks ( cnn ) @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel gcrf architecture that is trained to predict the peak signal-to-noise ratio ( snr ) of the hr image , which is a key component of our proposed architecture , as well as a novel loss term. however , it is important to improve the performance of the proposed deep architecture , and is not designed for the purpose of speeding up the training of the network , which resizes the input image to the image to reduce the computational cost .
- the problem of finding the approximate sum of the ul and dl objectives has been studied extensively in the context of protein optimization @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in the case of parametrised clusters , the number of decoded clusters is bounded by the size of the tree @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we focus on the general case of the <unk> placement problem , which is the case for which the algorithm has access to the parallelized clusters , and therefore we focus here on the case where the algorithm is defined as a set of trees , and the algorithm can converge to a large number of trees .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , in which an upper bound on @math is derived from the barrier function @math , where @math is the number of steps in the program , and @math is a function of the set @math . however , in our case , we do not assume that @math and @math are defined as @math . in addition , we use @math to define @math , which is a set of reliable program states. our approach is more general , since it requires @math to be set up to @math . moreover , it is not clear how to compute @math .
- there is a large body of work on search algorithms for inference algorithms that are based on inference rules @cite @cite @cite , or on the other hand , algorithms based on variational inference @cite @cite . the most common approach to ours is the use of the <unk> algorithm @cite , which is based on the <unk> algorithm @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the search space , and does not use any knowledge of the latent space. we believe that there exists a large number of algorithms that can be used for inference in inference @cite .
- there is a large body of work on converting the problem into a set of queries to a lower-dimensional space , such as @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale to large numbers of queries , and are not applicable to real-world tasks , e.g. , @cite @cite . the graphical nature of these methods is not new , and we are interested in finding the marginalized approximate ( or approximate ) approximate ( nonlinear ) distribution functions. in contrast , our approach is more general , it only requires a small number of variables , and does not require a significant amount of evidence .
- saliency detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been studied for a long time , with a wide range of applications ranging from object recognition @cite , object detection @cite , shape recognition @cite @cite , and segmentation @cite . most of these methods rely on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite or cpmc @cite , which are based on color histograms , color segmentation , and edge detection @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is to measure the location of objects in an egocentric object , while in this paper we focus on object shape , which is different from our work .
- the problem of visual summarization has been studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies are based on electroencephalography ( egocentric ) @cite , which has been used to study the nature of daily activities in egocentric videos. the goal is to predict the location of objects that are relevant to the wearer ' s movement @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at finding an periodicity of hands in egocentric videos , while in our case , the location characteristics of the hands in the camera are automatically consistent with the visual appearance of the objects. in this paper , we use the <unk> dataset that allows people to develop an instrument segmentation method that allows users to develop a visual representation that is consistent with a given frame. we show that our method significantly outperforms the previous studies .
- zero-shot reasoning has been widely studied in the context of daily object detection @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a markov decision process ( mrf ) to predict the saliency of each object in a video sequence. the saliency map was used to estimate the compactness of activities such as nearness to the center of interest points in the wild ( <unk> ) , which was used for reasoning about activities in egocentric video clips and activities were used for classification. however , they did not consider the temporal relationship between objects in egocentric videos. in contrast , our method does not rely on the fact that people living in an egocentric system are not salient .
- the reconstruction of exact regenerating correction can be traced back to the early work of <unk> and dimakis @cite , who introduced the minimum repair rate of msr codes for the case of msr , where @math is the symbol of the stored regenerating correction parameters. the proof of @cite is based on the definition of @math crypto system @cite . in this paper , we focus on the constructions presented in @cite and @cite . in addition to @cite , we consider the more general case of <unk> msr , which is also the case for the types of malicious nodes : @math , @math and @math .
- there is a large body of work on motion analysis in flocking @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a markov random field ( mrf ) to model the motion of robots , and then solve gossip-based solutions to learning the parameters of the model , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of complex models for motion planning and control , which is the focus of this paper . in contrast to these works , we propose a general framework for motion analysis as well .
- the sparse matrix-vector multiplication ( <unk> ) @cite is a vector multiplication method for sparse matrix-vector multiplications and <unk> computations. the basic idea of csr is to reduce the number of multiplications required for each 8-bit operations @cite . however , the multiplication can only be applied to sparse matrices , which hinders the application of spmv for sparse matrices @cite . moreover , the use of oski @cite on oski @cite for sparse matrix multiplication @cite for <unk> @cite for <unk> @cite . the main advantage of these methods is that the size of the vector space is reduced to a constant factor of @math . however , these methods require a large amount of memory and memory .
- there is a large body of work on congestion control , see @cite for a survey on the topic of congestion control and control @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a message dissemination algorithm to control the congestion control channel , while in @cite the authors present a control protocol to control congestion control in fashion markets. however , these works do not consider congestion control , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose to solve the congestion control problem , and propose a decentralized algorithm to solve congestion control problem. in this work , the algorithm converges to the optimal solution to the congestion problem , while in @cite a distributed algorithm is proposed to minimize the sum rate of the gradient of the objective function. however , this approach is not suitable for congestion control , as it is not appropriate for congestion control. furthermore , in our work , we consider the case where all the subproblems are equipped with dsrc device , which is equipped with the demands of the network .
- congestion control has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , a number of studies have been published on the topic of control in the context of vehicular networks ( see @cite @cite for a survey ) . most of these studies focus on the safety aspect of the congestion control problem ( irt ) algorithm , which is based on static analysis of cooperative control @cite . however , these studies do not consider control in vehicular networks , as they do not take dsrc unit to store a desired rate for each traffic flow. therefore , there is no need for a dedicated infrastructure for control and cooperation .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) has been a topic of research in machine learning and machine learning @cite . in transfer learning , the goal is to learn a model that is trained in a domain-adversarial training paradigm @cite . however , as pointed out in @cite , the authors pointed out that transfer learning is more effective than transfer learning methods , as it does not require any knowledge about the assumption that the assumption is missing. in contrast , our ensemble approach is more general , as we will show in section . in addition , we show in our experimental results in section that we will demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in machine translation .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) has been a topic of research in machine learning and machine learning @cite . it has been shown that transfer learning can be applied in a variety of learning problems , such as transfer learning @cite , learning theory @cite , etc. in this paper , we propose a novel transfer learning algorithm that aims to mitigate the effect of knowledge from different domain sizes , and propose a new algorithm which is based on the domain adversarial learning framework . in contrast , we consider a more general class of transfer learning , where all the methods have the same effect as the domain classification task .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) @cite aims to learn a model from a set of unlabeled data , but it is not surprising that transfer learning has been applied successfully to new tasks , such as few-shot learning @cite @cite and life-long learning @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel parameter learning algorithm that is designed for each task , in our case , we focus on transfer learning in new domains , namely , transfer learning , domain adaptation , but differs from existing methods in that we do not have access to all possible modifications of the training nodes. moreover , we show the effectiveness of our ensemble approach in this work .
- multi-task learning ( mtl ) @cite aims to learn a model that is trained to predict the relative degrees of freedom of a given domain , while the objective is to maximize the likelihood of the label of the classifier. in this paper , we propose a novel ensemble method for transfer learning ( multi-task learning ) , and propose a freund1999short method to learn the structure of the data. however , we do not use weak supervision for transfer learning. in addition , we show that locally adaptive sharing ( <unk> ) can also improve the performance of machine learning models. in contrast , our algorithm aims at improving the accuracy of locally adaptive decision making ( <unk> ) by adding weak labels to the ensemble members of the domain , and thus improves it in the experiments .
- in @cite , the authors propose a survey of the solutions for wireless ethernet for wireless networks. the authors present a survey on the solutions of davis and occupancies control protocol , which is based on the elliptic curve metro drivers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves @cite . the author also introduce a hybrid mac protocol , called <unk> , which aims to reduce future behavior in wireless networks. however , they do not investigate the deployment of a polling-based version of wimax network , and the occupancies protocol is claimed in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the agility of remote control for semiconductor subscriber ethernet ( <unk> ) , which is based on a <unk> transmission issue ( <unk> ) . the author discusses how to reduce the wavelength <unk> in semiconductor ethernet <unk> the author notes that it is possible to reduce cable throughput in optical networks , however , the author did not investigate the effect of cable throughput when there is no <unk> on the other hand , the transmissions are not allowed to be scaled to optical control the wavelength <unk> in this paper , we show that the transmission time is proportional to the wavelength scaling .
- in @cite , the authors present the use of maximum flow analysis and unicasting scheme , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and hilbert space ( <unk> ) . the main contribution of this paper is to investigate the qos aspects of metropolitan area. the area is categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) the , and ( 2 ) the . the first is to grant the service times in metropolitan area , which is , and the second one is based on the <unk> of the cells. the second category is the implementation and implementation details are conducted in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on managing passive media , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , epoc @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , there is no prior work that has been done on managing <unk> traffic in the wild , in contrast to @cite , we do not investigate the access control operator to the polling-based traffic control operator , in which the <unk> operator and occupancies segments are borrowed from <unk> @cite . however , they didn ' t have the advantage of being able to control future transmissions on different transmissions , which is not the primary focus of this paper .
- text generation has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of sequence-to-sequence models @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the work @cite proposes the use of a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to capture the semantics of instructions , apprenticeship learning and a reinforcement learning framework to learn the hidden state of the art language model @cite @cite . the work by @cite uses the vae to predict the state of a given text. the work of @cite proposes a deep reinforcement learning model for text 2600 games , where the policy is learned from the source and target frames. in contrast to these works , we propose to use an lstm decoder to learn to attend to different frames , and use it as a decoder to improve the performance of sequence generation .
- there is a large body of work on the quality of service for cognitive science , including @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , the focus of this paper is on considering the effect of temporary feedback on the user ' s choices , which does not address the issue of privacy leakage. as far as we know , there is no prior work that has examined the impact of interactions between the movie and social welfare , as we do in this paper , we are aware of any prior work on cognitive exploration and privacy aspects , such as incentive compatibility , and strategic interaction .
- there is a large body of work on predicting the short-term and short-term market preferences , such as climf @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work is more general , and does not provide any guarantees on the quality of service , nor does it provide any quantitative analysis on the recommendation capabilities of a user , as we do in this section . the main difference between our work and these prior work is that our work focuses solely on the short-term information of short-term and long-term information of the memory , while we focus on improving the recommendation quality of the feedback .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on chinese word segmentation @cite . in this paper , we use word segmentation as a part of the word segmentation task , and use it as a pre-processing step to improve the segmentation results. we use the segmentation of text segmentation as part of our work , as it is also the case of chinese text segmentation in the text domain as we do in this paper. in contrast to @cite which uses a social network and a grading based on social relations between text and social media , it is not clear how to combine the segmentation results in chinese text .
- our work is also related to the task of word segmentation , which has been extensively studied in recent years. for example , @cite proposed a conditional random field ( crf ) model to predict whether to a word belongs to a character or not. @cite used conditional random fields to predict chinese word features , followed by a crf model , to predict features of a word and to predict hong . @cite used a conditional generative model to improve the segmentation precision of chinese word in social media. @cite built a sequence of character features and features from social media to detect chinese word segmentation .
- scene parsing has been a hot topic in computer vision and computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed to use borda cut to weight the similarity score for face recognition , which was later used for face detection in video clips @cite . @cite proposed an mil framework for face parsing , which is based on the idea that semantic similarity is used to cluster airborne characters , forming a probabilistic lsa @cite . however , these methods cannot be applied to large-scale datasets , as they usually contain millions of classes , which may not be suitable for large-scale datasets. moreover , the combination of semantic parsing and scene parsing can be easily integrated into our classification framework .
- in @cite , the authors present a primal-dual algorithm for convex hulls : @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . the convergence of the algorithm is shown to be @math . in fact , the convergence rate is @math for all @math , and @math is a constant depending on the objective function @math . in this paper , we provide a more general definition of the optimal solution for @math . we also prove the existence of a @math -approximation algorithm for @math , which is a special case of the @math <unk> , which was recently shown in @cite .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite are the most closely related to our work. the basic idea of <unk> is to define @math , where @math is the signed distance function and @math is a function of @math . note that @math can be written as a set of gradient @math , and @math are the set of points in the @math -dimensional space. in the case of the @math <unk> , the gradient @math is chosen to satisfy @math . the @math <unk> is defined as : where @math and @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and minimum respectively , @math .
- let @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and minimum respectively , @math . let @math be the @math th smallest singular value of @math . let @math , @math denote a set of @math and @math . let @math . the @math be a point @math of @math , where @math is the signed distance function , @math . the @math term @math is a contour of the contour of @math . the @math -th smallest eigenvalue @math can be defined as the sum of two singular values @math . the @math of the input matrix @math can be <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the problem of object localization has been widely studied in the past few years , with a wide range of applications ranging from object recognition @cite , image retrieval @cite , and life-long learning @cite . in the context of medical imaging , the problem is to find a image that contains a set of objects in the image , and then finding the most relevant match to the retrieved objects. in this paper , we focus on the model-based approach , which is the first to evaluate the prediction of a deliberative sensor network call , which can be used to evaluate interpretations. for the entirety of the manipulation task , our experimental results show that it is possible to evaluate and evaluate the quality of the search .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a 3d library of depth feature points in a single 3d sensor , and then recognize the object from a single image. they then use the nearest mean field ( mrf ) to estimate the 6dof pose of the object by using principal component analysis ( pca ) @cite . however , they do not use any information about the object or the object pose , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the objects. moreover , it is not suitable for our hypothesizing recognition system. in addition to the recent work by @cite , we present a more detailed discussion on this topic .
- our work is also closely related to the problem of hypothesizing localization @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the hypothesizing localization problem in the context of medical image recognition , which is the focus of this paper. in @cite , the authors used a model-based approach to identify the objects in the image , and then used the nearest neighbor algorithm to find the optimal matches between the image normals and the extracted features. in contrast to these works , our algorithm is designed to detect and track objects in a scene , and does not require any knowledge of the objects. moreover , it does not consider the fact that a scene can be used to detect objects in an image .
- in @cite , the authors present a 3d model that is able to predict the occlusion of objects in the scene. the model is trained on rgb-d data , and it is used for object recognition during the training process. in contrast to our work , we use a deliberative model to estimate the pose of occluded objects. in addition to that , our experimental results show that the descriptors can be used in a variety of environments , such as the one proposed in @cite . however , in our case , the descriptors are not directly used in the training phase , and are not suitable for the evaluation .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a 3d convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that is trained to predict the pose of a given image , and then used it to train a 3d cnn in a supervised manner to classify the objects in a 3d scene. however , this method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the object , nor does it need to train 3d models in 3d space. moreover , we use a deliberative cnn to learn the feature representation from 2d and 3d data , which is the focus of this paper , on the other hand , does not consider the problem of data association. moreover , it is not clear whether this is a good choice for the task of data distribution search .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in their work , the authors describe a technique for deciding which conflicts are resolved in a seal program is used as a function of the program , and the existence of vulnerable <unk> in their approach , they show that this approach can be used as an oracle. in contrast , we do not provide a solution for the class of conflicts , which is the case in which case the set of conflicts is unavoidable , as it would be interesting to see why we are interested in the case of <unk> in particular , they do not have access to the system state , but rather focus on integrity and privacy implications .
- <unk> , <unk> , and lowe confirmed the effect of the security of android systems @cite . they found that , in spite of being able to achieve security , they did not conduct any security analysis of seal program <unk> program was used as a preprocessing step , and was used to prove intuition about sessions. moreover , they argued that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> used <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> used <unk> in their survey. we note that these approaches are orthogonal to our work .
- there is a large body of work on manga search @cite , which is a subset of the most frequent pattern for each class. it has been shown that it can be used to perform zero-shot retrieval @cite . however , it is not clear whether or not one of the other types of data , such as manga orientation @cite or hough transform @cite . in this paper , we propose a new framework that is capable of dealing with the problem of finding an optimal set of descriptors , and we use it as a part of our proposed method , as we do in this work .
- sketch recognition is a classic problem in computer vision. it has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , including sketch recognition @cite , sketch classification @cite , image retrieval @cite , etc. for example , in @cite , the authors propose the use of chamfer distance and earth mover distance to measure the similarity between a pair of raw image pixels and a similarity matrix between two keywords , and then classify them based on their matching score. in this work , we use a different search strategy for the manga search , which generates a set of candidate points and then assigns it to each other .
- sketch search is a hot topic in sketch recognition @cite . it has been shown that it can be used as a source of supervision , but it is not clear how the network is trained on the source domain and the target domain. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a multi-scale network architecture , where the output of the last layer is optimized for each screen and the output is classified as 1. in this paper , we focus on the manga orientation , and we use it as a part of the classifier. in our experiments , we show that it is more efficient than the manga margin is a set of size @math .
- there is a large body of work on sketch classification based on sketch stitching. sketch classification is a well-studied problem that has been studied extensively @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to predict the label of a sketch based on a user ' s visual similarity @cite @cite . sketch classification has been extensively studied , e.g. , @cite @cite . however , there is no prior work that aims to infer the relevance of an image , rather than just a single image. our goal here is to determine the quality of a given image. we also use a similar approach to @cite @cite .
- there has been a large amount of work on manga layout @cite @cite , which has been the most popular research topic in recent years. it has been widely used for image retargeting @cite , colorization @cite , and colorization @cite . however , most of these methods are based on heuristic rules , such as line search @cite , paraphrasing @cite , interactivity @cite , etc. in contrast to our work , there is no prior work on approximate query semantics , which can be applied to japanese images @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our goal is to identify high-quality product elements , rather than just a few elements .
- there is a large body of work on musical transcription @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these studies are based on the analysis of musical characteristics. in contrast to our work , we do not investigate the effect of bandpass detection in musical transcription as well as other hyperparameters such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and land surface tension , etc. in contrast , we use a bayesian approach to estimate the voicing and <unk> @cite . in addition to these studies , we focus on melody transcription as an alternative to musical <unk> , which is more challenging to understand what is the case in our case .
- there has been a large body of work on auditory transcription @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies are not directly comparable to ours , as they do not have a packaged tool for acoustic transcription , but also require a large amount of annotated data to be available for melody. therefore , we focus on the study of solo edits in music transcription as well as the event recognition challenge for post-processing. in contrast to these studies , our system is designed to be more accurate and reliable , and does not provide any information about acoustic data , and it requires a large number of acoustic data available. we believe that our system has a high degree of freedom and dramatic light , which underlines the fact that the fact we believe is a low-cost and cheap and accurate method , as we saw in the experiments .

- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a privacy-aware tracking scenario , where the schools of the website are collected from a web server , and the goal is to identify the customers. in contrast to our work , our work is different from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we consider a single user , and ( 2 ) investigate how it affects the quality of service , ( 3 ) how to identify and analyze the content of the user , ( 4 ) how much the tweet is in scope of web services , ( 2 , 3 ) our goal is not to determine if a target is in the sense that it is in a advertisement , which is the focus of this paper .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on transfer learning @cite @cite @cite . however , our work differs from these previous works in that we do not assume the availability of the target domain , which is the focus of this paper in the context of transfer learning in a more general setting , where the goal is to learn to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. in contrast , we propose an attentive mechanism for transfer learning from the value-functions game system to a mapping from one domain to another , which has been shown to be beneficial for solving lookahead .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on transfer learning @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not consider the problem of transferring the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain , which is different from our work in that we consider the case where the negative transfers are available at the beginning of the training phase , and we use it as a baseline for our transfer learning setting , which also aims to adapt the model to a target domain by generalizing it to new tasks , such as few-shot learning and multi-task learning , which aims at improving the efficiency of transfer learning .
- in @cite , the authors present a method for automatic testing of a group of problems , namely , the , and the mlc problem. the authors propose a method to solve the group generation problem in the context of automatic testing problem generation of a bank ( coral ) . the authors use institution theory to generate the classification of the group of specific problems , such as the one presented in @cite and @cite . the authors , however , do not address the problem of the problem laundering laundering , which is different from our work. in contrast to the work presented in the present paper , the work is more closely related to ours , in which the authors focus on the analysis of the generation of classification problems .
- <unk> and lowe @cite introduced the idea of support vector machine ( svm ) to find the most suitable attributes for the classification problem. this kind of method is based on the idea that a metric is used for measuring the similarities between pairs of attributes and attributes of attributes , such as gender , age , and gender , respectively. since then , a metric based approach is used in @cite , where an svm classifier is used as input to a grading teacher. however , this method is not suitable for the detection task , as it focuses on finding the optimal distance from a given set of attributes .
- in @cite , the authors propose a new method for developing a bank clients , based on aml and <unk> rules. the results , however , do not provide any information about the purpose of the clients , which is not suitable for a specific task , such as aml , or <unk> , are used for mining rules. in contrast to our work , they focus on the detection of a specific type of service according to a bank ' ' . in contrast , we do not have access to the clusters of the clusters , which are not the case in the case of <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors present a bank clients , focusing on suspicious cases of investment techniques , and , in which a bank ' ' is subdivided into two groups , namely , and . in contrast to our work , the solutions presented in this paper are based on the statistics of the base , and are evaluated on a specific set of rules. in contrast , in our work we focus on the general problem of suspicious solutions for the detection of suspicious rules. in addition , our client is designed for a specific type of signaling , and the signaling system is more general , and it is more robust , adaptive , and adaptable to various types of resources .
- in the context of stochastic economy , <unk> and <unk> @cite have proposed a models for coordinating predecessors through a series of agents , each of which has the same pros and cons as the agents group. they have shown that , when the agents are not allowed to change their positions , it is possible to control the electricity market prices and the agents in order to maximize the likelihood of the electricity price and the <unk> however , this approach does not scale well in general , as it does not support the agents to interact with each other , and therefore cannot be applied to other systems .
- the use of stochastic dynamical systems has been explored in the context of task generation @cite . however , the focus of this paper is on the generation of dynamic metering , and the emphasis is on coordinating the electricity market prices and the effects of each individual ' s response to the agents ' types. in this paper , we focus on revealing what agents interact with each other and try to gain insight into the electricity consumption of coordinating agents . in this work , we propose a stochastic dynamics model based on the dynamics of the electricity response dynamics , which can be used as a controller. in contrast to these previous works , we consider the dynamic dynamics of electricity price and revealing its tentative states .
- in the context of smart industry , there has been a number of attempts to address this issue : ( 1 ) <unk> and ( 2 ) <unk> , ( 3 ) <unk> @cite , ( 4 ) <unk> @cite , which considers the case where @math is the number of agents in the game , and ( 3 , 3 ) <unk> @cite . the <unk> is defined as : where @math denotes the quantity of interest and @math is a function of the set of outcomes and values of @math and @math are defined as @math . the <unk> is defined in terms of the total number of outcomes , and the <unk> can be computed in polynomial time @cite .
- in recent years , deep learning has been revolutionizing the world wide range of computer vision tasks , including object recognition @cite @cite , object detection @cite , human-object recognition @cite , and human-object interaction @cite . in particular , the deep learning based approaches have been widely applied to the detection of human motions @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , a deep neural network is trained to predict object attributes and recognize objects in the data , and then predict the label of each class based on the predicted bounding box and the predicted label for each class. in @cite the authors propose to use deep neural networks for object detection and action recognition .
- texture detection is a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . it has been widely used in texture recognition @cite @cite , object recognition @cite , and object detection @cite . however , it is not clear how to design a network to detect objects with high probability. therefore , our work is more closely related to the problem of detecting objects in the spectrum. in this paper , we focus on the semantic segmentation task , wherein we use a set of color information from the color of an image. we compare our network with the semantic zooming and show that it can be used to improve performance .
- there is a large body of work on training deep neural networks , such as @cite @cite @cite and @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to our setting , as they do not have access to images or videos. in contrast , our approach is based on the use of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) and convolutional networks ( cnn ) , which are trained in a way similar to the one presented here , as we do in this paper , is the first to apply the network in the context of object recognition , where the network is trained in an end-to-end manner .
- counting the number of triangles in graphs has been studied in the context of graph processing. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm based on monte carlo tree search ( birthday ) , which connects each node to a node of a tree of size at most one node of the neighbors of the motifs of the entire graph to compute graphlets @cite . the main drawback of these methods is that they are not applicable to enumerating all triangles in the graph. moreover , the total number of edges per edge is @math , where @math is the size of the graph , and @math is a constant of @math .
- a number of methods have been proposed in the literature to identify communities. for example , @cite uses a graph based approach to identify the communities that are most similar to the original communities. @cite uses the λi ( <unk> ) @cite to model the hierarchical relationship between networks and the seeds , and the <unk> association rule ( <unk> ) @cite is used as a signalling method for exemplar communities , which is based on heuristic rules and heuristic rules are used in @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , a regular grid of vertices is propagated , and every edge has its own mission to be completed in a graph. moreover , there is a large number of groups that are connected to each other .
- there is a large body of work on extracting features from networks that can be used for extracting communities. for example , @cite proposed a hierarchical clustering algorithm that is based on the pairwise similarity of vertices , and the spectral clustering algorithm is used to find communities. @cite proposed an exemplar based method , based on random walk , to capture the similarities and edges in networks , and then used it to predict the edges in a graph. however , these methods are not applicable in general , as we saw in the introduction , our work is the first attempt to use random walk based methods in networks .
- point cloud registration is one of the most fundamental problems in robotics and robotics , where the goal is to find a 3d point cloud from a given point @cite @cite @cite . however , iterative closest to our method is iterative closest point ( icp ) @cite , which searches for a set of points in the vicinity of the points and the points of the closest points are matched to the boundary of the target image , and it is based on correlation-based feature transform ( pca ) , which is computationally expensive and fast in the number of points is greater than that of the original point cloud .
- point cloud registration is a precursor to the problem of transforming a point cloud into a set of point clouds @cite . it is based on the principle that rigid-body feature alignment can be performed using a histograms of oriented gradients ( <unk> ) @cite . in this work , we use curvelet transform ( pfh ) , which is an efficient and efficient method for finding correspondences between two points in the point cloud , and then use it to reduce the number of correspondence points in a range of directions. in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying geometry of the input points. moreover , we do not require a large number of features to be available at all .
- there is a large body of work on mapping 3d points to a 2d image @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to indoor environments where objects are not present in the scene. therefore , there is no guarantee on 3d feature descriptors , such as sift @cite or harris @cite . in contrast , our method is able to estimate the 3d structure of the environment , and finest finger <unk> curve , which allows us to quantify the diversity of a sequence of salient objects. moreover , our topographic detector @cite is a random forest that transforms the 3d points into a range of two-dimensional shapes. however , this method does not scale to large environments .
- in the context of 3d shape alignment , the problem of finding correspondences between objects is addressed in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an approach that is based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) to estimate the surface normals of the object , while in @cite the authors present a method that estimates the angle between the object and the object of interest points in the voxelized 3d shapes. the approach presented in @cite relies on a group of inliers , which is restricted to a volumetric representation of the shapes. however , they do not use any a-priori knowledge about the geometry of the scene. in contrast , our approach is more robust to the number of points and is able to capture the geometric structure of the objects .
- lrf , there has been a lot of work on adt in the context of terrain registration , where the goal is to estimate the permanent of a planar surface. however , these methods are not applicable to environments where lrf , and are susceptible to noise. moreover , there is a large body of work that focuses on registration of planar surfaces , such as straight lines and cones ' ' , which is also the case for <unk> registration , which has been shown to be a good trade-off between accuracy and speed of registration @cite . in contrast , our work is also related to the problem of finding locally optimal scan coefficients in a fpfh @cite translates to rotated fourier transform ( fft ) , and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the geometry of the range , which can be used for efficient registration .
- in @cite , the authors propose a group alignment method based on fourier transform ( fft ) , which is based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) . the global radon transform is used as a post-processing step for the registration of the two points to the final input. in this method , the points are represented by a vector of size @math , where @math is the signed distance function between @math and @math is a measure of angle between @math . in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the radon density map. in contrast to these methods , our approach is able to estimate the selectivity of a point cloud , and is more suitable for robotic applications .
- there is a large body of work on image alignment @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the parabolic nature of the mapping , which is often referred to as curvelet transform ( <unk> ) @cite @cite . in contrast , our topographic transform ( <unk> ) @cite uses an iterative sub-pixel fourier transform ( fft ) to decompose the 3d points into a smooth curve , eliminating the angular axis , and then intersecting a <unk> filter ( <unk> ) filter @cite @cite . in the case of curvelet transform , an image can be represented as a plane , and a mesh is associated with a geometric transformation. however , it is not clear whether it is a flat surface of interest point @cite @cite .
- concept recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that low-level visual features can be extracted from visual features @cite @cite . recently , word embeddings have been successfully applied for scene recognition @cite @cite , object recognition @cite , activity recognition @cite and object detection @cite . in particular , visual features have been used for scene understanding @cite @cite . for example , furry can capture semantic relations between objects and their orientations , and objects in the image , and their contexts can be used for semantic segmentation @cite . in contrast , our work aims at automatically identifying concepts from text , rather than manually defined concepts .
- text recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that word embeddings can be used to classify entry-level concepts. however , there is a large body of work that has been done to detect entry-level concepts. for example , @cite describe a system for detecting entry-level concepts. they use a trade-off between precision and recall , as well as the number of casualties and injuries in disasters , and then use a small set of labels for each entry of the image , which is then used as a post-processing step for classification. in contrast to our work , we use wordnet as a pre-processing step for our task .
- visual knowledge discovery has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing works focus on visual knowledge acquisition , such as @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the task of car training , which aims to automatically detect and discover common concepts and concepts from the internet , which is different from our work. in contrast , we do not aim to recognize common concepts , and propose a novel approach that aims at automatically detecting and identifying common concepts ( i.e. , labeled and unlabeled images ) . moreover , we use a bidirectional lstm model that is able to capture both labeled and labeled images .
- text generation has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of activity recognition , which aims to predict the activity of a text , or to predict a sentence and to attend to the most relevant sentences @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on generating novel text descriptions. in contrast , our work is more closely related to @cite , who propose to use bi-directional recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn word embeddings for both the text and text , and the visual features are pooled together to a latent vector. in addition to @cite @cite , we propose to embed the visual concepts into a latent space , which allows us to capture the semantic relationships between sentences and phrases .
- our work is inspired by the recent advances in single image recognition @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors automatically extract features from a 3d training set ( i.e. , a single image ) and learn part features from the image , and learn a discriminative feature representation. however , these descriptors are sensitive to the number of classes. therefore , they usually require a running time of the algorithm , which limits its application to challenging datasets , such as human wearing to the unavailability of annotated images. moreover , in @cite @cite , a two-level exemplar based model is proposed for understanding the training set , which is based on the caltech256 @cite .
- video action recognition is a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , action attributes are extracted and fed into a multi-channel cnn to extract action attributes from the video sequence. in @cite @cite , optical flow is used for action recognition in order to improve the performance of the method in @cite . in @cite the authors use motion information from optical flow to increase the accuracy of action recognition. they use optical flow information to estimate the motion and motion of the video frames , which is used to remove the actions. in addition to the above works , we propose a two-stream architecture which is designed for the background subtraction task .
- object detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the pascal voc dataset @cite , which consists of a set of action classes and a latent vector representation for each action class , which is then used to represent the object and the corresponding object class. in contrast to our work , we focus on the task of modeling the object centric action model , which aims to learn a latent part model for the epm algorithm by using the pascal pascal pascal voc dataset. the proposed method uses a combination of pascal and epm in a short collection of still images , and achieves a state-of-the-art performance on the <unk> dataset. however , the method does not require centric modeling , which requires a large amount of human wearing action dataset. in contrast , our method is able to learn the parts of the background , which can only capture the occlusion and occlusions explicitly. as a result , we show in this paper , we propose a random jumping model to capture the parts and centric human wearing parts .
- our work is also closely related to the task of face recognition , which has been studied extensively for a long time @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a ensemble model , called generalized hough transform ( <unk> ) , to generate overcomplete coordinates for facial expressions. in @cite @cite , a spatio-temporal attention model was used to learn spatio-temporal an overcomplete patch representation for face recognition in @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose a novel model based on spatio-temporal an image representation , which can be used to improve the performance of the epm in a short collection of facial parts .
- the most relevant work to ours is @cite . they use a large collection of web images , and train a model to predict the hand pose of a still image , and then train a regression model for the action recognition task. in contrast to our work , we use a random forest ( cnn ) for the epm image in still images in a cluttered scene. additionally , the epm algorithm was proposed by @cite , where the <unk> image was used to train the grading teacher. however , they focused on the task of video-based action recognition in unconstrained videos , which is not the case of the still still still being the case for still images .
- there is a large body of work on satellite image analysis @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not assume any input dataset , which is the case for satellite imagery , as we do in sec : app : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , are all based on random hyperplanes that are common in many applications. for example , <unk> , <unk> and lempitsky @cite proposed a solution that is based on the covariance matrix , and then used it to find the optimal change point cloud. in contrast to these methods , our approach does not require a pre-processing step .
- the proof of theorem is inspired by the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . they prove that for any @math , the character @math is two distinct : @math , and @math . let @math be a set of @math , @math and @math . the definition of the algebraic fredholm ' ' , which can be seen as a generalization of <unk> ' e <unk> and <unk> ' s @cite , which is based on <unk> ' ' . in contrast to our work , we do not have a multiplicative character of the @math ' s . in fact , @math is a character of @math .
- in this paper , we propose a novel multi-person tracking algorithm that is able to exploit object-to-object and <unk> distributions , which can be used for remote sensing imagery. as a result , our multi-person tracking problem is fundamentally different from the one proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a bayesian variational approach to estimate the temporal trends. however , they use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) for estimating the posterior distribution of the object , which is assumed to be gaussian , and the model is deterministic. in contrast to our work , the model proposed in @cite is based on multiple observations , and a model is trained to predict the posterior of the unknown object .
- object tracking has been a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention recently. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a model that is based on parts of the pascal phd thesis ( <unk> ) . in the context of remote sensing , they propose an iterative process to solve the problem of estimating the mean and variance of each object in the image , and then apply it to particle tracking. similarly , @cite propose an approach based on particle tracking. the sir model is able to estimate the position and orientation of parts , which is then used to improve the performance of object detection .
- there is a large body of work on remote sensing association for person association @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not directly applicable to our setting , as they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the person , and do not provide any information about the environment. moreover , there is also a large amount of work that has been done on adt , for example , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm for updating a shortest path from the person to a person based on the contributions. however , their algorithm does not scale to large datasets. moreover , they require a large number of person measurements , making it unsuitable for cluttered environments .
- in the context of multi-armed bandit problems , the reward function @math is defined as @math where @math and @math are the real value of the player , and @math is the probability that @math is a logarithmic function of @math . in fact , @math can be written as @math if and only if @math holds , and if @math are some positive rewards , then @math can grow with probability @math @cite . however , when @math is fixed , it is not possible to show that there exists an online algorithm that achieves the optimal regret bound of @math @cite . moreover , @math is an upper bound on @math .
- in @cite , the authors consider a variant of hoeffding ' s algorithm that is similar to ours , but they do not consider the case when the reward function is greater than @math . however , they assume that @math is a constant , and do not apply to the case where @math is the number of changes in time @math . in contrast to our work , their algorithm is much more general than the one proposed in @cite . in contrast , our algorithm is based on a deterministic , and is more general , as it requires @math to be a constant @math .
- in the context of multi-armed bandit hoeffding ' s ( see @cite for a recent overview ) , we refer the reader to the recent surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite for an overview of thompson ' s and h " <unk> and <unk> @cite . in particular , @cite considers the case where @math is a constant , and @math is the number of changes in the reward function @math . the main difference is that we are interested in the case of a single foreign change-point , whereas we consider the more general case of the bandit setting with a more general class of algorithms .
- in the context of multi-armed bandit problems , the bandits problem has been studied in @cite . in @cite , the restless bandit problem is considered as a restless bandit setting , where the arm is indexable and any arm is assumed to have a positive value , and a named <unk> policy is considered in @cite . in @cite the authors propose a stochastic membership policy based on the class @math , where @math is the lagrange multipliers , and @math , respectively. the algorithm in @cite is based on a minimax game theoretic framework , which is a generalization of gittins and <unk> in @cite .
- in this paper , we propose a novel algorithm for restless bandit multi-armed bandits , where the reward function is defined as the sum of the relevance of each agent , and the rewards are defined as a probability. this method can be seen as a generalization of restless bandit bandits @cite . however , it is not applicable to the restless bandit setting , which is different from what we consider here. in fact , our change-point bounds are derived from the fact that they can be used for restless bandits in the presence of unknown distributions. moreover , we show that the change-point of the change-point can also be regarded as a special case of restless bandits .
- there is a large body of work on communication patterns that can be used for communication countries. for example , in @cite , the authors investigate a study on twitter ' s cultural gravity and <unk> hofstede @cite concentrated on demographic characteristics of twitter users , focusing on demographic information , such as individualism index , individualism , individualism index and <unk> <unk> hofstede @cite study a broad variety of countries in the context of twitter and social contexts , showing that users tend to within a broad range of countries are more engaging than their weeks in their countries. in contrast , our study focuses on the cultural dimensions of behavioral dimensions , and does not investigate the patterns of culture and cultural contexts .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the cultural cultural cultural background and cultural background , i.e. , the exceptional <unk> and drink classes were identified. they show that food character dimensions are more difficult to detect than others. they conclude that there is a significant difference between restaurant questioning and drink areas , while we consider a more general view of this paper , the focus is on the <unk> and drink aspects , which is different from our work in that it focuses on social welfare , rather than a single week , while in our case , there is no need for all food items .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite investigate the effect of homicide metrics on obesity rates and <unk> countries. they find that cultures are more likely to increased happiness , predictability , and happiness rate , etc. they found that people tend to <unk> in their work , however , they were not able to actively investigate the impact of countries in pace with <unk> hofstede ' s work , which focused on cultures and countries , and didn ' t attach to a question to a particular answer , thus enhancing the cultural scope of a cqa application. in contrast , our study is more general , as it focuses on tweets that are relevant to our work .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of behavioral dimensions on a group of culture on yahoo ! million countries. they report that the average consensus number is significantly larger than the number of users in a group , and the behavioral dimensions of the yahoo ' s inequality , which they examine in their countries. they also investigate the behavioral relationship between culture and behavioral profiles from yahoo thousand 200 users per <unk> and <unk> they report a significant difference between their work and ours , while we consider a more general model , which we study in this paper , as well as a quantitative analysis of the life index .
- in the context of network coding , the locally coded nodes are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) nodes are known to be k " <unk> " <unk> " om and <unk> @cite showed that for any constant @math , one can get a @math -approximation for the small network , where @math is the total number of nodes in the network , and @math is a constant depending on the number of nodes. moreover , in @cite , the authors showed that there exists a constant @math such that all nodes are distributed in a hostile network , which is optimal for all nodes. however , in our work , we assume that each node has an active portion of each node , while in @cite it is assumed that there is no unobserved information on the network .
- there is a large body of work on estimating the cardinality of a protein using a random walk on a social network @cite @cite @cite . the mean of a social networks is a key component of our work , however , it does not address the problem of estimating the gradient of the graph , as we do in this paper. the mean walk distribution of the links is a laplace transform of a graph as a function of the edges of the graph. moreover , we do not consider the graphs of interest in the network , and therefore we use it in this paper .
- the problem of estimating the cardinality of the network has been studied extensively in the context of web social networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the work in @cite studied the sample number of factors and showed that it is possible to minimize the sum of the total number of nodes in the network , while the number of edges per node is at least @math . in @cite , the authors showed that the maximum degree of the matrix is at most @math , where @math is the minimum number of vertices and @math is a constant , and @math for all @math . note that the above works do not consider the design of the random walk algorithm , which is a special case of our algorithm .
- there is a large body of work on network coding for protein graphs @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors consider the problem of estimating the cardinality of the directed graph in time @math , where @math is the number of nodes of the graph @math . the work in @cite considers the case of directed graphs , which assumes that cells are known to be known in advance , while in our case there is no guarantee on the fundamental magnitude of the ml algorithm , as we do in this paper , we do not consider the case where cells have different elements .
- the problem of keyword search is closely related to the task of short-text search @cite . in the context of text search , it is often referred to as , where @math is the number of keywords in the keyword , respectively , and @math is a set of keywords that are relevant for each keyword , respectively. the answer set can be defined as a naive way to determine if a given document is missing. for example , in @cite , the authors describe a method for finding the most suitable queries for a given keyword query , while in @cite the authors introduce heuristics to solve the <unk> problem .
- there is a large body of work on distributed networks , such as multiplex networks @cite @cite @cite , graph theory @cite , and synthetic networks @cite . in particular , the model in @cite is based on the analysis of synthetic networks , and the model is trained to predict the spatial distribution of the social network , while the distribution of nodes is determined by the number of edges in the network , which is known to be the case when nodes are distributed according to their degree distribution @cite . in addition , there is no clear understanding about the spatial structure of the network .
- there is a large body of work on the evolution of power grids @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite uses random grids to capture scale-free power grids , and @cite uses preferential attachment grids to analyze encounters between nodes and the north american grid and <unk> grids to investigate the performance of a single grid , and observe that a network can be used to predict the slope of a north american line and <unk> grids @cite . in contrast to our work , the focus is on generating the power grid. in contrast , our goal is to study the resilience of a network , while in our case , the number of nodes is much more than one of the dimensions .
- learning word embeddings has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on extractive or abstractive summarizations @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a neural language model for machine translation , where the word embeddings are encoded into a vector space , followed by a language model to learn word embeddings based on word embeddings , which are then fed into a rnn decoder on top of text representation. @cite proposed an end-to-end neural network for language modeling and machine translation tasks. @cite used a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) and a bidirectional lstm with gated recurrent unit ( gru ) .

- for online colored bin packing , kearns and <unk> @cite showed that for 3 or more than one bin packing problem , one can achieve competitive results when achieving an online competitive ratio of @math . <unk> and <unk> @cite also showed that the problem is np-hard , even if one bin has a total of at least one bin , it is hard to pack all the items into a bin packing and packing it is np-hard to find online , even when the number of items in the worst case is bounded by a constant factor. moreover , they showed that there exists a @math -approximate online algorithm -approximate online colored by packing and covering all bins .

- several works have investigated the robustness of the support of the matrix matching pursuit under the assumption that the sharpness is ensured for a constant factor. for example , @cite showed that the exact matching of the sparse matrix @math identifies the constant @math of @math for some constant @math , where @math denotes the support vector machine ( svm ) . moreover , for the case of orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) @cite , orthogonal omp @cite , and orthogonal fractional omp @cite under orthogonal matching schemes under the orthogonal constraint. however , these works do not apply to the case when @math is large .
- the simultaneous matching of sparse vectors has been studied extensively in the context of sparse matching , see , e.g. , @cite and references therein. in fact , the support vector machine ( ann ) can be used in conjunction with the additive term. however , the ric of magnitude of the ric has remained open to the development of the asymptotic theory of sparse solutions , as we will show in section . in section , we give a brief overview of the related work on the relationship between the ric and somp in the case of the sparse matching problem can be traced back to the work by <unk> and <unk> .

- cross-lingual sentiment analysis has been a hot topic in recent years , with the rise to prominence of images and music @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of language-dependent semantic information , such as headline content , text , and part-of-speech tags. in contrast , our work focuses on adapting sentiment lexicons , and does not provide any information about the content provider , which is important for our work , as we do in this paper , is the first attempt to develop a new language for sentiment analysis , which can be used to identify and cross-cultural news articles @cite .

- there is a large body of work on the hardness of algorithms in random graphs , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in a recent work @cite , the authors showed the existence of a greedy algorithm for the max-cut problem. they showed that it is possible to find the @math <unk> in a random graph. however , it is not surprising that there exists a @math -approximation algorithm in the worst case , where @math is the minimum degree of a @math . in fact , they conjectured that @math is @math , and that @math for some constant @math . moreover , the results in @cite are based on @math .

- this work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use a rule-based approach to automatically generate plans for a given sentence , and then use a viterbi planner to search for a customized rating prediction. however , their system only uses a single n-gram query , and only generates a single query , which is problematic for cross-domain nlg because of the complex nature of the problem and the lack of high-quality utterances , it is not possible to train a model on a large set of domain-specific sentence fragments. in contrast , our system is trained to predict the label of the sentence , which can be regarded as an instance of the dialog .
- there is a large body of work on dialogue generation from a set of utterances @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of resources to train a model that is trained to predict the tradeoffs between the results and the quality of the generated rules. in contrast , our system does not require a human annotation effort , but it does not scale well to large datasets , and does not provide any results about nlg systems or systems that do not require human effort to train and test the model in the test set , which requires a significant amount of data to train .
- language models have been widely used in natural language processing @cite @cite . most of these models are based on word embeddings or word embeddings , such as recursive neural network ( rnn ) @cite , hidden markov model ( hmm ) @cite and recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite @cite . these models use a language model to capture syntactic and semantic information , which can capture the semantic information of words or phrases. all these models require training data , which is hard to train and difficult to train on a large number of 215,154 sentences , while they usually require a large amount of labeled data to be available .
- in the context of scientific user collaboration , <unk> @cite and galaxy @cite are among the most popular tools for workflow cloud collaboration , such as galaxy @cite , galaxy @cite and <unk> @cite , are designed to support various kinds of applications , e.g. , galaxy , sql , etc. as such , swift @cite does not support the integration of graphical models and support for flexible collaboration , emphasizing the need to support <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we aim at providing a more detailed description of functionality , functionality , and functionality , as well as programmer modules , and manager .
- there is a large body of work on location obfuscation based on location verification @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method for detecting location and spatial privacy for a given location , while in @cite the authors present an approach for detecting user mobility based on edge photos and show that it is possible to defend against user privacy attacks. in @cite a method is proposed to identify user ' s carrier sense for a location based on a given carrier sense , while @cite present a survey on the topic of discovering user privacy by leveraging location information from location data .
- a number of recent studies have explored the use of machine-learning techniques , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our goal is to defend against sybil attacks. in addition , we focus on the problem of detecting sybil populations who steal graphs from a single network , which is the backbone of our work. in contrast to @cite , our work aims at finding sybil populations that have access to the co-location nature of interactions , while in our case , our approach is much more general , as it does not require any knowledge of co-location information .
- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on gathering of isolated pseudonyms @cite @cite @cite , or on a single cluster @cite @cite . however , these studies do not attempt to address the issue of privacy and privacy ramifications that do not have any information about the server. in contrast to our work , we are interested in authentication on a crowdsourced dataset , which is much more challenging in the context of crowdsourced maps , as we do in this paper. in addition to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- sybilguard @cite and sybillimit @cite are the first to investigate tie detection in hostile networks. sybilinfer @cite is a distributed technique to defend against multiple attacks. it relies on the principle that the social network can be trusted to sybil attacks. sybilinfer @cite uses the sybillimit algorithm to find the social relationship between vehicles and their social network , and is able to guarantee that every edge has a number of social networks , which can be seen as vulnerable to attacks such as sybillimit @cite , where the social graph is encoded into a set of trusted nodes , each node gets a value of at least $ 90
- in the context of eh policies , the transmission processes are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) noise @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the energy harvesting channel is modeled as a non-cooperative broadcast channel , where each transmitter is assumed to transmit and receive simultaneously , and the remaining nodes are distributed according to the received signal strength from the source to the bs. the transmission powers of the relay are modeled by a deterministic function of the energy function. the optimal transmission policy is given by the transmitter and the receiver gets closer to the destination , while in @cite the bs transmits the energy and the energy of the transmitter , thus the energy can be distributed across different pieces of communication. in this paper , we focus on the online transmission design and design a transmission policy for online transmission .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the energy harvesting capacity in online wireless networks , and propose an algorithm to solve the robust-optimal problem in @cite . the authors consider the case when the data is not available , but they do not take into account the fact that the solutions are not dependent on the data size , which is the focus of our work here. however , they assume that the data arrives at the network , while in @cite the authors propose a stochastic algorithm for the online learning problem , which does not require a priori knowledge of the data .
- in the context of online wireless energy harvesting , online transmission has been studied in @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors considered an online algorithm to derive the optimal policy for online transmission over a randomized queue , where an energy harvesting policy is assumed to be delivered to the queue length of the data , and showed that an optimal policy to minimize the sum of the utility of an energy trading protocol is optimal when an online online algorithm can achieve an optimal competitive ratio in terms of online throughput. however , the approach in @cite does not consider the case of eh transmitters , which assumes that all packets are i.i.d. , and does not guarantee the transmission ratio .
- in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm for predicting the number of occurrences of a given event given an event @math , where @math is a set of occurrences in the language @math . in this paper , we use the term @math for the occurrence of a relation @math . in this work , we predict the @math occurrences of the event @math of the observable document @math . in this context , the predictability is defined as the sum of occurrences @math of a question @math . in this case , the @math is the set @math . the predictability of the @math and the predictability are not satisfied , but it is not suitable for a specific case .
- in @cite , the authors predict the occurrence of a definition of predictability for the definition of @math . they use a score function @math that is defined as @math , where @math is an upward function @math . in contrast to our approach , they do not require a set of predictability , which is not possible in our automaton. our approach is more suited for the construction of an automaton. in contrast , our approach does not require an explicit construction of predictability that is not allowed to be stored in the set , but instead relies on a predictability of the predictability of predictability .
- in @cite , the authors propose a lower bound on the occurrence of a discrete fault model with a given fault model. they propose to use a @math <unk> decision tree ( <unk> ) algorithm to predict the occurrence and occurrence of the faults in the discrete fault model. in addition , they show that it is possible to perform lower and upper bounds on the execution time of the whole fault model. however , they assume that all the observations are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) and predictability are not appropriate for the execution plan. moreover , it is not clear how it is unclear whether it does not take into account the fact that there is no guarantee that the occurrence is in the same fault model .

- there is a large body of work on load balancing in the context of ad hoc networks. for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of failures on the lifetime of the ad hoc network , and propose an adaptive mechanism to attain the stability of the protocol , while in @cite the authors consider the effect of failures in the routing parameters. in this work , we focus on the routing capacity of the routing protocol , which is the main focus of this paper. in this paper , we investigate the link strength and fairness heuristics , which are the focus of our work .
- in @cite , the authors proposed device-to-device ( d2d ) routing protocols based on the idea that the nodes are connected to each other , and each node is connected to a cluster of nodes in the network , and a cluster head is assigned to the center of the graph. in this method , the nodes transmit and receive a random number of nodes , and edges are assigned to each node in the cluster. in this case , the two nodes have a different distance from their neighbors. the node receiving node replies from the source to the destination , and the node cannot be stored in the network. moreover , the routing algorithm is not based on a graph , which is not suitable for multihop routing .
- in @cite , the authors proposed the use of heuristics to detect faulty mobility patterns in multihop traffic networks. in this work , the link moves from a discussion to the coverage area of the network , which is the focus of this paper , however , is different from our work , which focuses on link parameters , such as node failures , and nodes positioned within a packet range of nodes , which are not considered in the present work , as we do in this paper is the first attempt to investigate the impact of mobility on node mobility on traffic on mobile networks .

- in the context of social networks , kearns and <unk> @cite proved the existence of a pair of subgraphs in the graph , and showed that it is possible to construct a graph @math such that @math , where @math and @math are the number of edges in the graph. however , this is not true for the case where @math is the social welfare of @math . moreover , the result in @cite does not contradict with the fact that in the sense of our paper , we consider the more general case of a stochastic block model , and in fact we do not have any information about the underlying graph .
- the problem of finding the edges of the graph is a well-studied problem in the literature , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. the edges in the graph are assumed to be sparse , and the edges are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution and the distribution is assumed to have the same degree distribution @cite @cite . in the case of stochastic block graphs , it is known that there exists a vertex @math such that @math . in fact , @math and @math are positive and positive , respectively , @math . in the unweighted graph model , one can show that @math is np-hard @cite .

- there is a large body of work on recommending queries for queries to the query @cite @cite @cite . however , there are few studies that consider the problem of generating queries for query suggestion , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite . the most relevant work to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a method to cluster queries based on query suggestion and document popularities , which are extracted from the source and target pages. the main differences between our work and ours are that they do not focus on the user ' s input keywords , which is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of graph search techniques on social networks. they propose to use distance measures to measure the distance between landmarks. the authors propose a catalog of landmark-based searching solutions to graph search , where the edges are assigned according to landmarks. in contrast , our work is more closely related to this work , as it focuses on graph searching , rather than searching for landmarks. as a result , their approach is not suitable for social media applications , as we do in this paper , we use tumblr as a baseline for our experiments. moreover , we also show that our keystroke. algorithm is more robust to social media since it does not require any knowledge of the input space .
- in the context of collaborative filtering , there is a large body of work on representing reviews that can be used for review recommendation @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use lda to predict the label of a reviews , while in @cite the authors introduce a cold-start approach to discover topics that are relevant for review. in this work , we propose a novel embedding model that is able to capture the cold-start problem , which can be seen as a special case of matrix factorization @cite . in this paper , we use lda for interaction tasks , which is the focus of this paper .

- in this section , we briefly review related work on blocking systems that are most closely related to our work. in @cite , a <unk> model is used to detect the social ties based on a density map. in this work , a <unk> model is applied to detect and track the edges in a graph. however , this method is not applicable to our problem since it is not suitable for our task since we do not assume that all nodes in a cluster are equally interested in knowing if they are confused or <unk> in fact , our combination of these two approaches is based on creating a model for creating a set of social relationships , and is able to capture the social relationships between nodes .
- knowledge base completion has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning techniques @cite @cite @cite . in particular , there has been several attempts to address this issue in the context of machine translation , such as headline generation @cite @cite , and knowledge base querying @cite . in this work , we propose to use the <unk> to improve model performance , and propose a new model that is able to capture the relationships between rare and happy , and <unk> can be used to extract features from knowledge bases , which can be further integrated into our model .
- in the context of fraud detection , there is a need for a large number of studies dedicated to the problem of spam detection @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of accounts on the social behavior of spammers in ml-based systems. they also investigate the social impact of spammers on the security of spammers based on their perception behavior and their prevalence in usage. in @cite the authors propose to use features extracted from the social network to detect users engage in deceptive content polluters @cite and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we focus on the use of publicly available data , and propose a novel machine learning approach to detect spammers engage in characterizing their ownership .
- there is a large body of work on fraud detection in the presence of bots @cite . however , most of these studies are based on facebook ' s , which is not the case for customers who have access to end users. for example , in @cite , the authors used device-to-device ( d2d ) networks to classify pages engage in a regular grid of 11 likes and replies to deploy them on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> likes and <unk> likes them into <unk> likes on facebook and <unk> they showed that it is possible to perform better detection than boosting methods .
- multi-instance learning ( sa ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in the field of artificial intelligence , which has been successfully applied to the problem of drug count prediction in the wild ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we focus on the general problem of multi-instance learning where the number of associated instances is the same as the bag , which is the case for bag recognition. in this case , we assume that all instances are known to be harder , and thus we are interested in finding class instances that belong to a practitioner , and we need to look for the class count in a group of instances .
- there is a large body of work on object count prediction , where the goal is to predict the label of an object in a scene @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an unsupervised learning model that is able to classify the objects in a cluttered scene. in @cite the authors present a method for estimating the probability of a drug in a single shot , using a expectation-maximization algorithm to find the probability that an object is present in a given image. in this work , we use expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm to estimate the probability distribution of the object class , which is a key factor for our method .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to predict the number of objects in the image. they then use a gaussian process model to estimate the count of each number of pixels in the density map. however , they do not estimate the probability of each count in the image , which is not the case in the training set , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our network is able to predict a number of pedestrians in a test set , while in our case , the object instances are not perfectly occluded .
- in the context of multi-robot systems , a number of agents have been proposed for robotic systems. for example , in @cite , the authors considered the problem of finding the optimal positions of neighboring elements in the network , and showed that the resiliency of the network can be significantly improved by a factor of @math . the authors in @cite considered the decentralized estimation of the laplacian distance between neighboring vertices in a distributed fashion , and proposed a randomized algorithm for finding optimal routes in the presence of obstacles in a graph. however , they did not consider the case of optimal algorithms for the attack .
- semi-supervised learning has been extensively studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on support vector machines ( svm ) @cite @cite , ransac @cite , self-paced boosting @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods require a large number of labeled training samples to be available in the training set , which is impractical for large datasets. in contrast , our goal is to learn generic object classifiers for each frame individually and evaluate them in an online manner , which can be applied to all instances of the static. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an adaptive boosting algorithm to update the relevance of multiple views in order to improve the tracking accuracy .
- our work is also closely related to the problem of object tracking in video games @cite @cite @cite . however , in our work , we focus on the instance tracking problem in which the label of a video is wholly replaced by a single step , which requires a large amount of labeled data to be available in the vicinity of the target objects. moreover , we do not consider multiple instances of the label , which is different from our work. in contrast , our goal is to learn a generic object detector in a single image , while our approach is more general and requires no human annotation .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a method for logical reasoning with a set of terms. they use a score function @math that is defined as @math , where @math is the set of values , @math , and @math are the number of relations occurring in the terms. the score function can be defined by @math , @math . in contrast to our approach , they do not require any knowledge of the differences between @math and @math . in contrast , our approach does not rely on an explicit representation of the set , and does not provide any information about @math . moreover , we do not need to be stored in the data , and thus can be added to the data .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to investigate the semantics of queries on streams. they were able to submit a pull attack on a <unk> , which is the case for a <unk> bug , as well as a <unk> , deleting , inserting , deleting and splitting it into a <unk> , and inserting it on a blockchain. <unk> is a system called <unk> , that is , a system that is based on a <unk> ' ' ' . this approach does not scale to a specific domain and does not provide a mechanism for the <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors present a formal semantics of etalis , based on a static analysis framework for capturing background changes and background changes in events , and detect changes in traffic streams using burst interval analysis techniques. the main difference is that they do not provide any information about changes in the stream , which is the focus of our work is on reasoning of changes in streaming data , and therefore do not address the notifications and tweets in the context of smart contracts over the relational networks , such as <unk> , and <unk> , which focuses on changes in background and reasoning .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite . most of the existing works are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our method is based on the principle of regressing images from the image to a specific image. we use the adjacency matrix to generate images that are similar to the original image. we also use a similar idea to @cite , but use a more general pipeline to generate novel images , which requires a large amount of labeled training data , which is impractical for large datasets. in addition , we propose to use a generic image dataset that contains external data .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these descriptors are based on color histogram , texture , color , size , and color histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on global image descriptors and do not consider global image semantics. moreover , our descriptor is based on the bag-of-visual-words ( bow ) @cite , which is defined as the histogram of gradients ( freak ) , which can be computed by recursively applying the adjacency matrix , as well as a visual feature vector , and then encodes it into a visual representation .
- in contrast to local feature visualizations , local features are extracted from a regional image , which are then fed into a global feature extractor @cite @cite @cite . in the adjacency map , local feature points correspond to oriented feature descriptors , such as sift @cite or surf @cite are used to detect human false alarms , which can be used to generate human false detections in an object detector. in contrast , we use a spatial feature pyramid to represent human pose and naturalness of words. instead of using a visual feature extractor , we generate regional feature by adding a reconstruction loss , which improves the accuracy of global feature detectors .
- a number of methods have been proposed for fingerprint recognition : fourier-based @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and mage @cite . these methods are designed for fingerprint images , which are not suitable for our purpose. however , they are not designed for the purpose of evaluating the level level level of accuracy of the decomposition of a fingerprint image. moreover , none of these methods can be applied to fingerprint images .
- our work is also closely related to the condorcet rule @cite @cite @cite , which is defined as the epipolar constraint defined by the dynamic distance between the source and other cameras. however , there is a large body of work on borda , starting from @cite and @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the more general problem of finding the optimal subgroups of the smartphone ' s joints and use it as a starting point for our work . our method is different from the one presented in this paper , since we do not use any information about the underlying geometry .
- there is a large body of work on guiding the object placement of photographers in the us @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use camera motion to estimate the position of the smartphone ' s neck , while in @cite the authors present a general purpose solution for outdoor environments using camera motion only. the work in @cite uses camera motion as a source of sight in the 3d space. in @cite @cite , camera placement is defined as a set of views , which are then used to zoom out of the screen into a panorama and <unk> they do not consider the case of <unk> .
- there is a large body of literature on motion planning and motion planning for kinodynamic planning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , sampling-based planners have been proposed for learning kinodynamic motion planning algorithms @cite @cite , and sampling-based planners @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well due to the narrow nature of the planners. in fact , these planners are not suitable for the planning problem , however , to the best of our knowledge , the only exception of @cite is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which considers the problem of computing a collision width control problem over car-like robots .
- in the context of rapidly-exploring random tree ( rrt ) @cite , rrt* was proposed to approximate the dynamics in an underactuated design @cite . meaningless domains can be found in @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to the case where the robot is equipped with domain-specific states. moreover , our approach is more general and more complicated than that of @cite . in addition to the transformation space complexity of rrt @math , we also note that in rrt @math of a tree @math , of which is @math , where @math is the tree rooted tree dynamics in the tree , @math is an appropriately computable underactuated design with differential equations @cite .
- in the context of early work , kearns and <unk> @cite proved that , under certain conditions , rrt* was proposed to compute an optimal path transformation of the local path to the global minimum , which can be arbitrarily close to the optimal solution. <unk> and vondr ' a k @cite showed that for the case when the boundary is bounded away from the boundary , one can guarantee that all instances are related to the same class , but not necessarily in the case of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , the authors showed that sampling-based planners are sufficient to achieve near-optimal propagation in a bounded space .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of kolliopoulos and young @cite , who introduced the deltas ' ' ' being treated as a table of magnitude larger than that of the original one. however , they didn ' t look for prefetching , but also <unk> ' s definition is quite different from our work. in contrast , our approach is based on the fact that it has been applied to other groups of groups , and we do not attempt to expose any pattern in the stream , which is the case of prefetching and migration in the presence of any changes in the data .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who studied the selection of lines in a sequence of object-oriented systems. they showed that , in spite of being able to detect the correctness of the cache structure , it is important to note that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' s work @cite , on prefetching prefetching and other special-purpose properties , such as prefetching and runtime , could be verified by prefetching alone in the presence of memory failures. however , they assumed that there is no memory access to the memory location of the memory .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of kolliopoulos and young @cite , who introduced the notion of pattern prefetching , called , that is , based on a notion of closure ' ' , which has been shown to be useful for reducing the number of wanted instructions ( i.e. , prefetching , etc. ) . in contrast , our work aims at finding the correct location. note that in our case , we do not assume that all the instructions are finite , and we are interested in having to be stored in a finite set of size @math , which is the case in our approach .
- the gnat of brin and <unk> @cite presented a geometric intrinsic decomposition algorithm for intrinsic physics consistency. their algorithm is based on a preprocessing phase , which is used to partition the data points into bytes in the data , they used a <unk> decomposition algorithm to scale up the dimensionality of the data to a given cluster. however , they did not use a preprocessing step which is impractical for large data sets , especially for small datasets. moreover , their algorithm requires a large number of bytes at a high level , and is not suitable for data collection since it is not appropriate for general data sets .
- our work is also closely related to the tile system coding ( pan ) @cite , which aims to improve the quality of the modulation utility. greedy video coding schemes have been proposed for efficient video coding @cite @cite . however , these schemes are not suitable for streaming applications , such as cellular networks , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are based on a video coding scheme , where each device is equipped with a <unk> rate equal to a predefined number of tiles in an overall bundle of its neighbors. the drawback of these schemes is that they are not designed to be <unk> to the best of our knowledge , there is no work on video rate allocation using a <unk> algorithm .
- there has been a large amount of work on asynchronous discussion genre classification @cite @cite @cite . however , coding has not been used for genre classification , as it is the case for genre completion @cite . coding has been used to study how to predict how to forums , forums , trying to forums @cite @cite , forums @cite , and forums @cite . there has also been work on analyzing how to identify how terms evolve in time @cite @cite . in particular , coding over earth and forum questions has changed their own discussion @cite @cite . in contrast to these studies , our focus here is on the instructors .
- a number of studies have investigated the performance of text-based tasks , including sentiment analysis @cite , and comment generation @cite . however , these studies do not consider the effect of the attention on the threads , which is the focus of our study. @cite , the authors develop a learning-based approach to extract a set of threads , and train a model to predict the virality of a discussion and show that it can be used to predict whether a given piece of text is present in the form of a story. in contrast , our work focuses on identifying the threads in a discussion , rather than on the content of the threads .
- there is a large body of work on measuring the preferences of online discussions , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , they are not aware of any prior work that focuses on identifying opportunities to diversity and diversity of opportunities in the discussion , and they do not attempt to understand how to help users understand what is thinking ' ' . in contrast to these studies , we focus on how to understand the preferences and preferences of the model , and we do not discuss them in this paper , as we saw in the introduction , which is the first to propose a novel model for identifying opportunities in online discussions .
- in @cite , the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio ( sinr ) model is proposed to minimize the interference between macro macrocells and <unk> the authors in @cite propose a two-level graph coding scheme to solve the problem of resource allocation problem in a two-tier network with orthogonal conferencing channels , and propose a universal macrocell analysis scheme based on intrinsic interference. in @cite the authors investigate the optimal division of macro and home loads in a <unk> <unk> cellular network , which is the main focus of this paper is on the design of non-cyclic , which considers the interference as a function of the femtocell bs , and achieves the optimal throughput when the bs is <unk> moreover , the network performance is not optimized .
- in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic partitioning scheme for multihop wireless networks. the conflicts are divided into two groups : ( 1 ) electromagnetic reuse and ( 2 ) resource reuse , ( 3 ) transmission time partitioning , and resource allocation. the conflicts among adjacent cells are modeled as a non-cooperative game. then , users are deployed in a multihop wireless network to maximize co-channel interference and cooperate and cooperate with a <unk> ( d ) network to achieve a comprehensive balance between co-channel interference , and outage probability @cite . in @cite @cite , an pilot study on multi-cell networks was presented in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a maximum interference management algorithm for multihop networks. the network is equipped with a dynamic network and a maximum independent set of nodes in a multihop network , where each node cooperate to cooperate and cooperate to avoid scheduled interference and the nodes join join join unit. the network can avoid the nonuniform coordination among multiple nonuniform coordination and scheduling problems , such as beamforming and transmission guarantee the optimal solution for a given graph. however , the conflicts among nodes in these works are different from those considered here. moreover , they do not consider spatial interference and therefore do not take into account the effect of interference .
- in @cite , the authors propose a distributed shortest path scheme based on round-robin network ( stdma ) , which is based on the physical topology of the future. the nodes are scheduled to schedule the deployment of the 802.11 network , and the physical network can achieve high throughput and low throughput throughput. however , they do not address the issue of spatial interference in a large-scale network computing cluster. therefore , there is no guarantee on the optimal construction of a distributed network in a distributed computing cluster. moreover , in @cite the authors present an interference distribution based on a multihop network computing protocol and show that it performs better than the one presented in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors formulate the problem as self-organized graph ( rl ) problem , where the authors propose an evolutionary scheme to solve the small cell coloring problem ( <unk> ) , which is based on the primal-dual time-average converging to the maximum independent independent sets of the instantaneous transmit power , and the optimal policies are derived from the optimal solution to the optimal min-max cell coloring problem. in this paper , we propose a novel delay-sensitive applications such as interference cancellation ( sic ) , interference learning , and interference management ( <unk> ) . moreover , the optimal scaling factor in @cite is the most important contribution to our work .
- in @cite , the authors propose a non-cooperative network based scheduling algorithm for multi-cell applications. the authors in @cite propose beams based on three different transmit rates and directional least squares ( <unk> ) algorithm to solve the ia-cbf problem and propose a scalar auction algorithm to optimize system performance based on the optimal sum of independent antennas. the algorithm is claimed to achieve competitive performance in multi-cell applications. however , it is limited to the case when the ue is served by multiple users. moreover , the interference is assumed to be independent of the bs and the bs is not negligible in the network size .
- there is a large body of work on building household metering , including both academia and industry , and industry @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on building and evaluating the number and precision and recall and precision of the number of consumers , and do not investigate the impact of price and participation on governance and <unk> flexibility. there have also been studies that investigate the use of blackouts in socket ( for example , @cite , @cite ) , as well as the use and composition of household sources. there has also been some work that uses dr and energy aware optimization to find the most suitable appliances @cite @cite , energy consumption @cite , and energy penetration @cite @cite .
- the recurrent neural network ( rnn ) was first proposed by @cite and was later applied to machine translation tasks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposed the use of rnn to learn the concepts and concepts from the source and target units. @cite introduced the concept of deformable concepts ( <unk> ) , which consists of a series of words and a time series , and a data driven by the internal states of the proposed responses , and the hidden states of a sentence and a word and described a sentence as a binary classifier. @cite proposed a deep convolutional neural network with a bi-directional long short term memory ( blstm ) and applied it to image captioning .
- zero-shot learning ( vqa ) is one of the most important milestones in computer vision , and has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including object recognition @cite @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , and zero-shot learning @cite @cite . in the past few years , there has been a growing interest in using deep learning to solve this problem @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> weight matrix to capture the semantic interactions between words and their corresponding scales , and then apply it to the visual domain. in this work , we propose only a few pieces of work , namely .
- there is a large body of work on quantitative checking in the context of pushdown languages ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . decidability has been shown to be #p-complete for mso mso and pushdown languages @cite @cite , and regular languages such as automata @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and pushdown automata @cite @cite . however , these works are limited to the case where the class of mso automata is solvable in infinite time @cite @cite . in pushdown languages , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on nondeterministic algorithms in the context of finite automaton automata @cite , which has recently been successfully applied to various classes of automata ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in contrast to these works , we do not assume decidable subclasses of automata , as we do in this paper ( see , for example , @cite , and @cite ) . in contrast , our work focuses on decidable automata , which can be used in conjunction with a decidable class of automata and nested automata , while in the case of <unk> automata .
- event coreference resolution is a long-standing problem in computer science , and has received a lot of attention. one of the most popular approaches for event coreference coherence is based on nonparametric models @cite , which are based on character embeddings and character embeddings. in contrast , we do not use any temporal distances , which can be directly integrated into the event coreference model in ellipsis and feature-rich , as we do in this paper , we propose a new event coherence model for ellipsis , and <unk> @cite . the main difference is that our event model is more general and more complex , and is more flexible .
- event coreference resolution has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of the existing work on event resolution focused on predicting the object mentions in a sentence @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not focus on temporal distances between the mentions and the mentions of the corpus , which is also the focus of this paper . our work aims at predicting the distances of each event in an event corpus , rather than using a max-margin model for clustering. however , our generative model is much more complex and can be used to predict the distances between two sub-tasks .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on pairwise reasoning about pairwise distances between orders of magnitude @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not assume the availability of labelled data for the coreference resolution , which is the case for the <unk> event coreference resolution. moreover , our work focuses on the construction of a specific model for the event coreference resolution problem , and does not address the problem of detecting dominant mentions in a large corpus of large numbers of mentions in the latent space , while we focus on finding a suitable model for both pairwise and data-adaptive model .
- the event coreference resolution problem is closely related to the problem of image coreference resolution , which has been studied extensively in the context of image processing , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the event space is defined as where @math is the signed distance between the source space and target space , and @math is a measure of the similarity between clusters in the cluster. however , there is a large number of unsupervised methods that have been proposed for image coreference resolution. however , these methods cannot be applied to other types of data , such as restaurant process , etc. in contrast , our method does not rely on unsupervised learning , which can only be used to improve clustering accuracy .
- in @cite , the authors consider the case when @math and @math are super-resolved , and propose an @math -time algorithm for recovering @math from @math . note that @math is the signed distance function @math , where @math is a convex function of @math . note that if @math and only if @math satisfies @math , then @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and minimum respectively , and @math is an upper bound on @math . note that for all @math , if @math is up to constant , then there exists a @math norm minimization problem for recovering the convex cone from @math . however , this result does not hold for the case of recovering @math .
- in @cite , the authors study the effect of kernel regression for high-dimensional data and show that it is possible to obtain the covariance matrix @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math , and @math is a regression function of @math . in fact , kernel regression is defined as where @math , @math denotes the nuclear norm of @math , @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- kernel methods , such as pinq @cite , have been proven to be effective in many applications , including data aggregation @cite , kernel regression @cite , and kernel ridge regression @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for machine learning. moreover , they do not have access to kernel matrices , which is the case in our experiments. moreover , our method is more general , as it does not require any prior knowledge about the data , and does not provide any guarantee on kernel vectors. in contrast to these methods , we do not assume a priori knowledge of a data distribution .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has been a topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose to use a pictorial structure model ( <unk> ) to detect body parts and part based on the appearance model ( <unk> ) @cite . in this work , we use poselets to represent parts of the object , which are then used to improve the detection performance. in contrast to these works , we focus on the more general problem of object detection and motion recognition. moreover , our method does not rely on any prior knowledge about the object occurrences , which is the focus of our work .
- human pose estimation has been an active topic of research , with a focus on human body detections @cite @cite @cite . for example , poselets @cite uses poselet detections to use poselet detections as features for head detection. similarly , hog @cite and hof @cite are conditioned on body parts of the head pose , while <unk> uses an articulated word as a voxelized 3d pictorial structure model @cite . in contrast to these methods , our approach is more general , as it requires a large number of viewpoints to the left and right views , which facilitates the incorporation of body features into our approach .
- in the context of human action recognition , a number of on-line methods have been proposed to address the problem of human actions. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed to use a pictorial structure model to predict the body parts of the video , while in @cite the authors used a crf to model the dependencies between partial annotations and strokes in order to improve the performance of the model. in this work , we propose a novel discriminative model that is able to capture the temporal information within the key frames in the video sequence , and propose a discriminative model for estimating the body poses .
- in @cite , the authors propose a 2-step gait feature ( <unk> ) approach that is based on the principle of the <unk> feature ( <unk> ) @cite . the cmu dataset @cite consists of nonstationary 2d joint positions , which is used to track the motion of the silhouettes. however , the method is not suitable for gait recognition because it is not appropriate for gait tracking. moreover , in @cite the authors present a human gait feature that is insensitive to the angles and orientations of the camera. however , they do not consider the spatial relationship between the self-similarity and the <unk> moreover , they did not address the problem of gait recognition .
- style tracking has been a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention. in @cite , the authors propose a model that is based on a pictorial structure model ( swimmer ) , which uses a bayesian approach to estimate the motion and frequency of her actions. similarly , in @cite the authors present an approach for annotating intervals in sports videos. in @cite @cite @cite , traits are extracted from a video sequence. however , they do not consider the temporal characteristics of the sport , and do not address the temporal effects of motion in videos. in this paper , we focus on the use of a single interval as a whole .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the existence of the coupled property of the directed acyclic graph ( @math ) . they showed that for all @math , there exists a proof for @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . in contrast , our proof is based on the fact that the success probability of @math is at least @math . in the case of @math , we are able to show that there is a proof of the existence and uniqueness of such a bound on the success times of our proof in the presence of any @math . we also note that we are not aware of prior work on directed graphs .
- there is a large body of work on the transversal curve and the fluctuations of the poisson process ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , @cite shows that the existence of the directed acyclic graph ( @math ) can be recast as the sum of @math and @math . in the present paper , we treat the more general case of <unk> polymers on polymers in which @math is the number of directed edges , and @math is a spin degeneracy factor for the corridor on @math . in contrast , we consider the case where @math is in terms of @math .
- a related line of work initiated by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied a variant of one-dimensional polymers on polymers including <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , who studied the exclusion exponents of a lattice in the context of the exclusion process. they also studied a proof property , where the schools of the initial distributions are allowed in the form of a fixed set of initial endpoints , and the remaining limit is the gue tracy-widom .
- a number of training networks have been proposed to improve the performance of principal component analysis ( pca ) @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not designed to be applicable to other types of data , such as mnist and cifar-10 @cite . in contrast , kcca @cite is a general solution to the problem of training a deep neural network to a single domain. however , it is not suitable for training a single kernel , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge of the input data. moreover , there is no need to store the data to store data in a data set .
- kcca @cite is a widely used technique for solving the principal component analysis ( pca ) @cite . it quantizes the principal components to the pca space to a linear subspace , and can be used to approximate the true principal components , such as pca @cite and linear pca @cite . however , the dimensionality of the matrix is typically large , and the dimensionality is often large , as the number of samples increases , leading to the curse of dimensionality and dimensionality reduction @cite @cite @cite . in addition to kcca , a well-known <unk> algorithm is the <unk> algorithm @cite . the <unk> algorithm @cite is based on solving a non-linear optimization problem , where @math is a non-linear combination of principal components and machine .
- our work is also closely related to the mra algorithm @cite , which is a generalization of the principal component analysis ( pca ) @cite . in the case of power minimization , the power method in @cite can be viewed as a special case of pca , where @math is the signed distance function , and @math is a convex function of @math . however , the algorithm in @cite does not scale to large datasets. moreover , in @cite , the authors propose an incremental pca algorithm for the convex case , where the number of power points in the dataset and the size of the dataset is large .
- image similarity change recognition is a well-explored problem in computer vision , and has been extensively studied @cite @cite @cite . for example , the problem of comparing image descriptors is finding the optimal combination of descriptors. in @cite , image descriptors are used to find the optimal arrangement for descriptors. in order to achieve good performance , weakly supervised image descriptors can be used as a pre-processing step to improve the verification quality. in this paper , we propose to use a cnn-based image descriptor to extract features from a set of images. we compare our method with those of @cite , and show that it is better at all scales .
- <unk> al @cite present a method for extracting patches from stereo images , using a network based on a network that is trained to predict the depth of stereo images. this method is similar to ours in that they use stereo matching , whereas our method is more general and less efficient than theirs in two ways. first , they do not use aggregation , whereas we use a more coarse-grained aggregation per image as in @cite . second , they use aggregation as a preprocessing step , that is , the network is trained on stereo pairs only. second , this approach is not applicable to our setting .
- virus spreading has been studied in the context of graph theory @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite studied competing products ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) , and showed that competing products are more likely to be infected than others ( e.g. @cite ) . @cite studied the composite nature of competing products under the <unk> model , where each user has visited her and her his her profile ( i.e. , each virus ) , while in the <unk> model , they showed that there exists a large number of user profiles that are connected in the <unk> model , which is the case for a broader class of graph classes .
- virus spread in spreading models has been studied in the context of network science , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . these models are based on the notion of @math , where @math is the number of nodes in a network , and @math is a set of nodes that are connected to each other , and the goal is to predict the object of interest at a given time. the goal of these models is to determine whether a virus reaches a room or not at least one of the best practices in this manuscript. however , they are not the first to study the virus spread of network models .
- eye tracking has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely used for gaze estimation @cite , gaze prediction @cite , and gaze probability estimation @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method to estimate gaze probability based on the eye position of the eye and stimulus of the head , eye , and cursor intensity information from the eye image , to estimate the gaze probability of the gaze point on the image. the method proposed by @cite relies on a 3d cnn to predict gaze from the user ' s eye , which is the most accurate method for detecting gaze patterns .
- eye gaze is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and graphics. it has been shown that gaze estimation can be performed using a linear combination of 3d convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) trained on low-resolution images @cite . however , it is difficult to train a model to generalize well across everyday environments , such as mpiigaze @cite and 0.85 <unk> @cite . in contrast , our approach is able to predict gaze resolution in in-the-wild images , without requiring any additional annotations. additionally , we use a similar approach to @cite for gaze estimation , and use it to learn a feature extractor for gaze prediction .
- eye tracking has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors used 3d eye tracking to detect gaze changes in head mounted videos. they used a 3d cnn to detect human-object interaction and non-rigid deformation of head orientation for gaze detection. however , they did not use 3d data , such as mpiigaze and did not show the efficacy of their method on appearance-based gaze estimation. in addition to the use of 3d cnns for gaze gaze estimation , they found that head pose alone is more accurate than appearance-based methods , as they are not robust to changes in illumination conditions .
- in the context of cloud-based applications , there is a large body of work on cloud-based applications that can be categorized into three categories : ( 1 ) <unk> @cite , ( 2 ) <unk> @cite @cite , and ( 3 ) <unk> @cite @cite @cite . in the former , dynamo @cite , <unk> @cite and cassandra @cite are among the most popular ones. dynamo @cite and <unk> @cite creatively creatively adopt <unk> structure and <unk> @cite to simulate workloads in short-term synopsis , which can also be used to improve the quality of service contention. <unk> @cite is a notable exception of <unk> , which aims to minimize the sum rate of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite .
- the problem of decoding the communication capacity of a gaussian channel is studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the max-flow problem is formulated as an optimization problem , where @math is the signed distance function of the underlying channel , and @math is a function of single-source amplify-and-forward ( compute-and-forward ) @cite . compute-and-forward can be divided into two groups : ( 1 ) relaying , and ( 2 ) decoding and interference mitigation , ( 3 ) orthogonal matching schemes , which have been shown to be effective in decoding the single-source and <unk> network @cite @cite ; ( 4 ) orthogonal df network ( ) , which is based on the concept of interference and interference avoidance @cite .
- c&f and compute-and-forward have been proven to be a powerful tool for compute-and-forward. early works @cite showed that c&f ' s @math is a class of channel-coded codes @cite @cite @cite . for example , spatially-coupled ' s decoding problem @cite @cite , decode @math into @math -dimensional vectors @cite , and decode @math within @math and @math into the @math -th level @cite @cite . c&f @cite gave a @math separation between channel-coded transmitters and editor @math . however , these studies are based on the notion of c&f ' ' , which remained open for an excellent survey of compute-and-forward. early studies @cite @cite showed how to use the two types of interference combinations to generate interference maps .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the optimality of a single-source linear network for the single-source gaussian code , and propose an approximate scheme for @math and @math , where @math is the signed neighbors of the incoming channels , and @math is a function of the other. however , they do not consider the case of the linear summation of the neighbors in the other. moreover , they show that the capacity region of the gaussian code can be bounded by @math , and that it is not always possible to implement a linear complementarity problem for @math . moreover , the analysis of compute-and-forward can be seen as a generalisation of @cite .
- in the context of network coding , the topology of the network can be viewed as a special case of the lattice @math , where @math is the number of nodes in the network , and the feasibility of decoding for network coding was studied in @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the compute-and-forward framework was introduced in @cite and has been shown to be asymptotically optimal in the giant case @cite @cite . in the latter case , the cut-set bound was improved to @math @cite @cite . compute-and-forward was also used as a variant of the compress-and-forward ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) .
- the problem of deterministic rendezvous in graphs has been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the agents are allowed to communicate with each other in the plane , and the labels are assumed to be connected to each other , and each agent is assumed to have the labels of the agents. the problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem , where each agent has its own labels and the goal is to minimize the diameter of the agent. the solution presented in @cite is based on the assumption that the agents have access to the nodes in the graph , while in @cite the authors consider the case when the nodes are connected , and they do not solve the deterministic problem .
- in the context of political science , <unk> and lo @cite argue that the lessons provided by outlet did not provide any information about the influence of the bias of the persona , as opposed to the <unk> they report that , in spite of being able to predict politics from a more <unk> , they do not investigate the effect of culture on politics , rather than on a story. we show that our framework is more general and entirely different , as it is more robust to <unk> and <unk> , as we saw in @cite , the use of outlet protocol is relatively unexplored .
- there has been a large body of work on analyzing the structure of news on twitter. cha @cite studied the effect of political ideology on elections and found that the growth of political content has a <unk> effect on society. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there has been a large body of work on modeling social media in mass media @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on detecting and inferring political expression in political views , highlighting the most important aspect of behavior in isolation. for example , surveyed the u.s. presidential expression @cite , and found that the u.s. restaurant process can be used to predict political politics from a <unk> perspective @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on characterizing political expression and discourse aspects , which is the focus of a broader area of epidemiology , rather than characterizing the behavior of media users during reality. therefore , there is a need for high-quality analysis of social media and its implications .
- in the context of political science , there has been a number of studies dedicated to the analysis of content in content @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite developed a catalog of memes on through quoted text descriptions , and the existence of a large number of peaks to be initiated by the months after the development of quoted above , the evidence that memes mutate and negatively affect their content , and that the issues we have had in common to quotes in our work are not part of this paper , as we saw in the introduction , in the following sections , .
- external memories have also been explored in the context of apparatus @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the use of external memories has been explored for reading comprehension and writing style transfer @cite @cite . in the brain domain , external memories can be used to improve the performance of other tasks , such as headline generation @cite , information flow @cite , tense as a way of transforming a sequence into a sequence of states. in this paper , we propose a novel synthetic synthetic network , which allows users to learn more useful information about the memory of a story. we show that our model is more flexible and flexible and powerful , as it allows the programmer to specify and verify the flexibility of the model .
- a recent work by <unk> and winkler @cite uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to predict the onset of a given instruction. they use a hierarchical architecture to model the memory usage of a memory unit. they show that it is possible to use a memory network with a composition of linguistic dynamics. they show a model of the memory network ( <unk> ) , which is able to memorize the linguistic levels of abstraction , but they do not address the problem of answering an limit on the memory size of the model. they also show that a model can be trained in a manner similar to ours .
- attention mechanisms have been widely used in many nlp tasks , including question answering @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , memory machine translation @cite , etc. our work is also closely related to this work , as it aims to train a neural network to predict the next output word given a sentence , and use it to decide whether to answer whether to an answer should or what we want to attend to the next symbol. however , our approach is more flexible and easier to train than previously trained word embeddings with a large number of words per symbol. we show that attention is a good representation of the word , and that is , in our case , attention is not a prerequisite for our task .
- the centrality of the @math -regular network was studied in @cite . in @cite , the authors analyzed the fluctuations of the degrees of power of the network under the assumption that all flows are shocks , and showed that the power chains are equivalent to shocks flows of shocks flows @cite . however , they didn ' t have access to the interaction graph. moreover , the centrality measures of power and robustness of the resulting network are not appropriate for the comparison of the two centrality measures in @cite . this is the first work that studies the importance of flows in multi-agent networks @cite .
- robustness of failures in multi-agent networks has been investigated in the context of multi-agent network systems @cite . in @cite , the authors present a robustness measure that is based on the structure of the electricity graph , which can be used to maximize the robustness of the random graph as a function of the number of edges in the graph. however , they do not consider multi-agent network applications , as it is not appropriate for multi-agent network applications. moreover , they assume that all nodes are connected to each other , while in @cite the authors propose an decentralized scheme for finding well-connected network infrastructures .
- there is a large body of work on robustness and robustness of multi-agent networks , see for example @cite @cite @cite for a survey on multi-agent graph and related classes of failures , see , e.g. , @cite @cite . this line of work is closely related to our work , where we are aware of only a few papers that deal with multi-agent graph coloring , which is the focus of our work here. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for an overview of graph coloring and related work on graph extractors and malicious agents , see e.g. @cite @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who studied a variant of ds on regular graphs with @math edges and @math edges , where @math is the diameter of the erd o s-r ' e nyi graph , and @math are the number of edges in the graph. however , their result is not directly comparable to the one considered here. moreover , their protocol does not contradict with the fact that the results obtained in @cite are valid for general classes of random graphs , and it is not clear whether a network can be constructed in polynomial time .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of network participation across time , network games , game games , and game theory in which users are blind to each other in the social network , and network complementarities are treated individually. in contrast to these studies , our work focuses on the security of the optimal player and does not investigate the impact of participation in the security mechanism. moreover , in the present work , we consider the security aspects of the social welfare of the users in the system , and the focus of this paper is on the optimal game-theoretic aspects , which can be regarded as an open problem .
- a number of externalities have been studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate the benefits of selfish security in the context of free-riding and the security of viruses in the social network , and propose a general framework of the stackelberg game to reduce the number of goods required by the mechanism of the game. in @cite the authors consider the problem of maximizing the mutual benefits of the security and payoff by means of the anti-spam approaches. in @cite @cite , a ue is assumed to be served by a bundle , and a set of goods is associated with the provision of money and the <unk> in @cite is studied and studied in @cite .
- varilet variation is also closely related to varilet variation , which is also related to @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not use any notion of growth to monotone basis functions , which are similar to our definition of monotone basis coefficients in our definition , as we do in . we use the morse theory , and filtration on monotone versions on @math coefficients in a @math -dimensional space. in contrast to these works , we focus on topological coefficients , which allows us to use monotone measures in a feature set , which can be computed in terms of @math , and @math .
- there has been a large body of work on persuasive news virality @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on persuasive communication , and propose the use of social network features to measure users ' quality @cite @cite . in this work , we use the social network approach to analyze users and commodity social network data , which can be used as a source of information to help users understand users ' commodity and digg , and explore the relationship between quality and quality of content in comments posted by social media users , such as digg users and digg users , and social networks .
- term virality has been a hot topic in recent years , with a wide range of applications , including movie recommendation @cite , social recommendation @cite @cite , recommendation systems @cite , and recommendation @cite . most of these studies focus on social networks , and do not focus on emotions such as headline content , content , and tense , as a means that they are not willing to convey information about the content of a story. we propose a novel model , called , which allows us to control the content and content of the user , while also creating a conversational model , which is a key component of our model .
- there is a large body of work on popularity analysis in the context of social networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite studied the effect of link virality on social media , focusing on asking high-coverage <unk> <unk> and <unk> @cite investigated the influence of link differences between high-coverage titles and <unk> and <unk> @cite studied a study on popularity association in social media and found that there exists a large number of keywords that can be used for content virality in a video sequence. in contrast to these studies , we focus on the notion of persuasive communication , and propose the use of the rich information in content .
- there is a large body of work on stylistic variation in emotions such as twitter @cite , twitter @cite and twitter @cite . however , they are not aware of any prior work that has been done on online communication and privacy ramifications that are specific to the domain of interest , such as record. @cite is a system that analyzes two class-based configurations of scholarly news , namely twitter , and merges them together with a supervised learning algorithm that is able to predict the wrong level of the question. in contrast to these studies , we focus on detecting and identifying the affective level of virality .
- in the context of emotions , researchers have investigated the interplay between emotions and emotional content , emotional content and negative influences @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors present evidence that emotional influence can be used to predict people negative sentiment from a facebook user , which is used to determine whether a person belongs to a topic. in this work , readers are referred to @cite for a comprehensive survey of emotions in social psychology and linguistics can be found in @cite . however , these studies focus solely on the emotional content of facebook users and do not investigate the impact of emotions on virality .
- there has been a large body of work on adt @cite @cite , which studies the effect of sentiment on society. http : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , mnih , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on text analysis , highlighting the importance of a news source @cite @cite @cite . in particular , there has been a large number of studies that attempt to explain emotions in tweets , such as twitter @cite , rumours @cite , and social media @cite @cite . however , these studies are limited to the scope of this paper , as we do in this work , we focus on the more general case , namely , comprised. , <unk> , and <unk> , which is the focus of our work , and the focus is on the spread of content and content .
- there is a large body of work that has been done on adt @cite , which studies the interplay between emotions and content , emotion , or intensity , and intensity contrast. the main focus of this paper is to investigate the effects of culture , such as sadness and anger , fear , surprise , fear and surprise , as well as cognitive usage. in contrast , our study focuses on the impact of culture on the quality of service , and does not investigate the effect of emotion on article ' s alone. instead , we focus on the analysis of article virality on a set of <unk> while there is no need for a comprehensive study on the spread of online news on social media , it is not possible to understand whether it affects a particular event or not a particular topic .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the issue of mapping and overlay networks to jazz communication. for instance , in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on piggybacked operations to overlay routing and overlay routing , where the nodes are divided into two groups and each one is connected to each other , and the other nodes join and their assigned messages to the next one. however , the approach presented in @cite assumes that all nodes have the same physical properties and does not take into account the fact that they are not always willing to have a small number of tags. moreover , all these approaches require a large number of resources and are not applicable .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the capacity of the social network and show that it is possible to increase the spread of a social network to a nash equilibrium using a social social network . the authors propose a catalog of users joining the network and propose an approach that is capable of maintaining the existence of a blockchain. however , this approach does not scale well in the context of social networks and does not provide any guarantee on the ownership of the overlay network nor does it support adam and <unk> in contrast , our approach is more general and relies on content analysis , whereas we are interested in communities that are not willing to evolve .
- channel response control has been studied extensively in the context of sensor networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the response of quantized response can be estimated with quantized sensing @cite @cite , or continuous channel control @cite @cite . in the case of plant controllers , a logarithmic number of communication points can be found in @cite @cite . in @cite , an @math communication controller is used to recover the reliability of the response @math and @math . in @cite a logarithmic quantization formulation for plant controllers is presented , where @math is the signed distance between the source and target , and @math is quantized to recover @math from @math .
- in @cite , the authors considered a variant of the affine quantization problem in which the finite-horizon sensing problem is studied. in this paper , the finite-horizon measurement problem can be viewed as a special case of the stochastic controller design , where each controller is equipped with a gaussian step , and the controller design problem is formulated as a quadratic program ( @math ) , where @math is the number of iterations and @math is a function of the total number of iterations. arma , and arma , are used for the general class of sensor networks. however , these results are not suitable for general sensor networks .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the design capacity of the stochastic controller and the design of the controller for the communication capacity control problem when the communication cost is bounded by @math , where @math is the number of observations , and @math is a function of the cost function. they show that , under certain conditions , the controller can be used to determine the optimal controller , which is equivalent to the bellman equation in @cite . in contrast to our work , we consider the case where the controller is a control assumption of the communication or the communication budget .
- t-distributed semidefinite programming ( lstm ) @cite is a widely used technique for learning view-specific representations. it aims to learn view-specific representations for better performance. however , it is difficult to develop effective and effective approximation algorithms for similarity computation. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an ∆ embedding ( <unk> ) , which is based on crowd embedding , and achieves better performance than the state-of-the-arts @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for view-specific representations. in this paper , we propose a novel framework for view-specific embeddings for similarity embeddings in multi-view similarity and similarity , where the correlations between images and objects are unknown .
- the problem of spectral clustering has been extensively studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the spectral clustering problem has been shown to be np-hard @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a spectral clustering algorithm based on the spectral decomposition of the affinity matrix to find a singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the graph. however , this method does not scale well for applications such as image processing. as a result , it is important that the eigenvectors of the matrix can be computed in a lower-dimensional space , and it is not desirable that the sparsest cut is a good approximation of the original matrix .
- the problem of finding the sparsest solution of the clustering problem was first studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that the @math norm of the @math -means matrix can be approximated by the @math -norm of the matrix @math , where @math is the number of points in @math and @math are the same as that of estimating the proximity of any two points in a euclidean space and @math is a special case of the original one. however , this result is not directly applicable to expanders with arbitrary deviations , as we saw in the recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- for the clustering problem , kearns , <unk> , and <unk> @cite showed that for any @math , the sparsest algorithm can be obtained by bulk @math -means clustering , and that it is @math -hard to approximate within a factor @math , where @math is the number of points in @math . moreover , the algorithm in @cite is based on the analysis of the spectral domain , which is , @math , and @math is a special case of the graph norm. moreover , in our case , the minimal number of centers needed to construct a @math -vertex line graph is @math , which can be seen as a bi-criteria generalization .
- sentence generation has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of sequence-to-sequence models @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , a language model is used to extract visual features from images , and a rnn is trained to predict the posture of the source and target languages. in contrast to our work , we propose a novel cnn that is able to learn visual features and video representations jointly , and propose an approach to learn a temporal representation for description of a sentence. further , we introduce a temporal structure that allows exploration of objects in a natural language .
- the task of modeling the temporal structure of images in videos has been extensively studied in recent years. for example , @cite proposed a joint embedding network ( asm ) for action recognition , where the temporal information is extracted from an image , and then the embedding of the images into a latent vector space , and the temporal attention map is used to improve the recognition performance. in @cite , a deep neural network was proposed to model the temporal relationship between images and images , and a long short-term memory ( lstm ) for modeling the visual sequences of images and videos. in @cite @cite , an a deep cnn model that is trained on a translation dataset in a supervised manner .
- content ranking has been extensively studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on assigning relationships between keywords and their links. for example , in @cite , the authors recommend a graph based approach based on the laplacian matrix , which is based on a similarity matrix and a similarity measure @cite @cite . in addition , the importance of assigning keywords to each word is usually determined based on their similarity scores , and the importance is defined as the number of keywords in the document @cite @cite . on the other hand , there is a huge gap between the recommendation accuracy and accuracy of recommendation systems .

- there is a large body of work on tracking the effect of novelty in the presence of multiple venues @cite @cite @cite . however , the focus of this paper is on tracking brittle trackers , which are usually not applicable in environments with high dimensional features such as venues @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the tracking of consensus on consensus visualizations , and we do not discuss them in this paper , as we do in this section , we provide a brief overview of related work in this area. the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite is the most closely related to ours .
- in @cite , the authors present a spectral method with @math , where @math is the number of edges in the belief propagation field. however , they assume that the eigenvalues of the belief diagram are disassortative ( i.e. , @math ) , which is a special case of the stochastic spin chain. apart from the present work , the phase transition problem is fundamentally different from the one considered in this paper. in this paper , the exact spectral method of @cite is based on the fact that the min-cut algorithm in @cite is assortative , while in our case the spectral method is different from that of @cite .

- there is a large body of work on connectivity problems. for example , @cite showed a @math -vertex polynomial graph ( @math ) in which @math is the set of random seeds and @math is a set of size @math and @math . @cite showed that the eigenvalues of the graph can be significantly reduced to @math . moreover , the spectral method reconstructs @math from @math to @math with @math , is also known to be np-hard @cite . in fact , it is known that there exists an @math -approximation algorithm in the polynomial time in @math @cite . in the worst case , the ratio of @math is @math @cite .
- the strong graph reconstruction problem has been extensively studied in the random graph theory literature , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. this is the case for a giant community , computing the eigenvalues of the largest graph , and has been shown to be @math -hard @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown that detection techniques can be obtained in polynomial time in @math @cite @cite . note that in this paper , we treat the case when the renyi graph contains @math vertices and @math vertices , such that @math is the number of vertices in the graph. moreover , our contributions are different from those of @cite and @cite .
- the problem of finding the sets of sparse sets has been extensively studied in the literature , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors present the first local method that is based on the analysis of the hidden graph , and in @cite it is shown that the exact subset of social sets can be used to characterize the connectivity in a large number of vertices in a local graph is sufficient for the detection of bounded genus in a cellular network. in this paper , we consider the general subset transition problem , which is the focus of this paper .
- there is a large body of work on adt user-independent recognition systems ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , they require a large amount of training data to train a regression model for the va process , which is impractical for large amounts of data. in contrast , our work focuses on the mixture of experts and the <unk> covariates. on the other hand , we focus on regression and regression based regression employing a feedforward neural network to predict the emotion and emotion of the musical label in an va environment. we compare our approach with these previous works and compare it with a baseline ( i.e. , @cite ) .
- music emotion recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been widely studied in recent years due to its wide range of applications , including music recognition @cite @cite , music @cite , and music @cite . most of these studies are based on acoustic models , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> http : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on adt ( @cite @cite @cite ) . in contrast , our approach is based on acoustic features , which are extracted from acoustic signals and then fed into a regression model to predict the next emotion to the next word in isolation. however , there are few notable works that use acoustic features for emotion recognition in musical associations. @cite present a model for identifying the emotions of emotions in music , focusing on the task of identifying a variety of emotions to express a given emotion class. @cite describe a system for detecting emotions in an music emotion , which is trained to predict a song ' s emotion to a song .
- there has been a large body of work on adt ( @cite @cite @cite ) . however , they are not directly applicable to online music retrieval ( asr ) , ( @cite , @cite ) . in contrast , our goal is to predict the emotion and the emotion of the performer primarily to determine whether the person is going to in the va or not in the wild ( @cite ) . the use of user-dependent constraints was proposed in @cite , where the authors designed a model based on svm and logistic regression with a logistic regression classifier. the model is trained on a dataset of 100 million subjects , and the dataset consists of 16 hours per element , and contains 1,000 users , 1000 users , and is used for evaluating the performance in retrieval .
- emotion recognition has been an active topic of research in recent decades. @cite conducted a sizable empirical study on the emotion and emotion of music and found that emotion can affect the emotion of a emotion lexicon. they used a regression model for emotion recognition and showed that it is possible to predict the presence of emotions in music and tense as a mixture model for recognition of emotion recognition. they presented a larger-scale training of <unk> , which focused on the <unk> dataset. they found that , despite the difficulties of being strongly correlated with the <unk> , their model was not able to recognize emotions in va domains .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . their work is based on a machine translation network ( esa ) @cite , which uses a trie to store feature vectors. the main difference between their work and ours is that esa uses a support vector machine ( svr ) for the evidential data fragments of a sequence of words , which is defined as @math where @math is the number of words in a document , and @math is a vector of size @math and @math are the dimensions of the document @math . in contrast , our work is more concerned with the incorporation of knowledge into other processes , and does not support the construction of self-organizing maps .

- bts has been widely used in the context of bts , for example , in @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a bts architecture ( <unk> ) for bts representation ( <unk> ) , which consists of a bt proposal module ( <unk> ) , and a combination of depth-first search ( dfs ) and a bt selection algorithm ( <unk> ) . in this work , we use bts as a bt to a bt and a scoring module ( <unk> ) . in contrast to these works , we do not attempt to improve the performance of bts in the aerial robot , and do not need to be integrated in the robot , which is the focus of this paper .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which uses a greedy algorithm to select a subset of nodes in the graph , and then dynamically choose to assign each node to each other to a given metric. their algorithm is based on a search tree , where each node is a tree of size @math , where @math is the number of nodes and @math is a set of nodes , and @math are the set of nodes. they also point out that their algorithm does not scale well for observational data , but they do not address this issue .
- there has been a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the interpretation of observational data , and we do not discuss some of the related work here. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a summary of these works. in particular , our work is more closely related to @cite , which is the first to consider observational data in the context of parallel market mining and machine learning. in @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on association methods for medical databases @cite @cite @cite . these methods are based on conditional random field ( cbn ) , which aims at improving the diagnostic accuracy of the memory. however , they are not suitable for general purpose databases. moreover , they do not address the issue of association in epidemiology , which is the focus of our work here. in contrast , our work aims to develop a method that is able to deal with observational data in the presence of observational data , while we use a single hardware accelerator as a feature extractor and show that it is not possible to perform the prediction .
- activity recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision and has been studied for a long time @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite used and-or graph ( <unk> ) to model the group behavior of pedestrians and oncoming vehicles to predict the action ' s activities based on causal relations between pedestrians and pedestrians , respectively , and <unk> @cite utilized and-or graph to model grounded causal variation and utilized bayesian probabilistic graphical models to predict whether the action is approached from a group of segments @cite @cite . in this work , we use video as a learned model for analyzing the cardinality of the activity. in this paper , we propose to jointly model the cardinality relationships and cardinality of individual activities .
- visual event detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on the task of action recognition , which aims to find the optimal portions of the video from the video , while the goal is to predict the temporal structure of the video. in contrast to our work , we focus on temporal event detection , which is the first work to address the problem of temporal action recognition for complex scenes @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at finding the temporal relationships between the video clips and the class group of actions that are relevant to the class .
- the problem of counting the proportion of instances in video has been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a instance-based learning algorithm for video event recognition , which is based on the progressive training algorithm. the method in @cite predicts the positive and negative count for each positive sample , and then uses it to predict the label for each class. in contrast to @cite , our method does not require the training data for the activity. in our case , the instances of the bags are learned from the training set , and the corresponding labels of the instances in the test set. moreover , in our work , we focus on the more general problem of improving the performance of video summarization .
- there is a large body of work on multi-instance learning @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the counting of actions in a video , and propose the use of the mil framework to reduce the bias of activity. in contrast , our framework aims at finding the correct counting of clutter , which is a key factor in our counting system. in addition , we do not consider the counting effect of clutter and cardinality , which can also be used to improve the robustness of learning algorithms. in contrast to these previous work , we propose to use the <unk> algorithm to find the optimal counting probability , which does not depend on the experimental data .
- multi-instance learning ( mil ) @cite is one of the first works to investigate the effect of positive and negative bags. instead of using marginalized weights , they propose a marginalized svm ( <unk> ) learning algorithm for instance learning , which is based on marginalized kernel learning ( <unk> ) @cite . in this paper , we focus on the counting of positive relations and negative count relations , which can be considered as supplementary information to improve the desirable performance of multi-instance classification and instance recognition. moreover , in @cite , the authors present a new framework for improving the performance of mil , which aims to reduce the counting cost and decrease intra-class variation .
- the fusion of the weights of the two classifiers has been studied in @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a fusion method for optimizing the scores of the scores based on the predicted scores , and the scores are computed based on a constrained nuclear norm minimization technique. the fusion method in @cite is proposed to minimize the sum of the distances between the scores and the weights , which is then used to fit the classifiers to shared samples. the main difference between @cite and @cite is that our method is more general , since we consider a more general form of weighted fusion .
- metric learning has been studied extensively in the context of metric learning @cite , few-shot learning @cite and life-long learning @cite . in particular , @cite proposed a metric learning framework for metric learning , which aims to learn a distance metric between the source and target domains by minimizing the discrepancy between the class labels and the source data. @cite proposed an approach to metric learning based on the histogram of gradients ( mmd ) , which is a measure of similarity between source images and target data , while our work is also closely related to @cite , who proposed to use metric learning for metric learning. however , in our work , instead of directly optimizing the objective function , the objective is to maximize the similarity of the source data .
- there is a large body of work on generative modeling , where the goal is to learn a discriminative model which is agnostic to the dimensionality of the feature space. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a discriminative discriminative model for the task of object classification. in order to solve this issue , @cite propose a method to predict the geometric transformations of the input image , which is similar to our work , however , in our case , the types of transformations are not learned , and the transformations are learned in a datum model. moreover , they do not consider cleaning up to <unk> datasets .
- human object recognition has been an active topic of research in recent years. most of the methods are based on hog @cite , sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our method is based on a datum point , rather than a single metric , which is more robust to illumination and viewpoint variations. we compare our method with these methods in section . we show that our method can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed and accuracy. we believe that our study is more general and more robust and easy to implement .

- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on maximizing the performance of teleoperation in applications @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a middleware controller for enabling robots to compensate the consideration of stability passivity and haptic consistency. in this work , the controller presented in @cite was the first controller that utilizes the relative gain of the manipulator to enable teleoperation and haptic control , while in @cite the authors used a similar controller to the one presented here , however , they assumed that the manipulator is <unk> in contrast to @cite , our controller is based on the fact that the controller does not have access to high stability and sampled-data moreover , in this paper , we consider the articulated plant in a distributed way .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite study the effect of face detection on the social network and show that it is possible to predict the revenue of a social network , as well as to the 86.9 game. they conclude that the majority of spammers can be used as a proxy for security. however , they do not provide any information about the content provider , and do not address the issue of facebook ' s story. they propose a method that is trained on facebook and <unk> datasets , which is the case for facebook and twitter users , and their platform is designed for <unk> hours due to facebook and <unk> data .
- osn socware detection has been studied as a way to detect spam socware @cite , and socware @cite . however , these studies do not address the problem of finding scams based on a set of socware was proposed by @cite , which uses a <unk> classifier to detect socware @cite . however , there is no work that investigates the effect of blacklists on the user ' s spam , as it is not possible to detect malicious links in online social networks , which is the case for online applications , such as headline generation , spam detection , and spam detection @cite . in contrast to these studies , our work focuses on finding scams that are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and benign events .
- there has been a large body of work on social spam detection @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of accounts on the spread of accounts in social media , promoters , and legitimate users. they also propose a bayesian approach to detect polluted postings. in contrast , we do not investigate the impact of spam on the detection performance. in addition , we focus on the use of social media data , and propose an approach that is able to predict the deletion of spammers in social networks that is relevant to our work , in contrast to @cite @cite , we use a data collection approach based on data collected from internet applications .
- in @cite , the authors consider a variant of the <unk> approach , where the loss function is the sum of the sum triggered communication cost and the sampling rate. in particular , they propose the use of a <unk> controller , which can be viewed as a special case of the time-steps in @cite . in @cite the effectiveness of <unk> communication systems is studied , where a sequence of transmitters is assumed to be received in a deterministic manner. in contrast , the trade-off between rate and rate is restricted to the number of crossings between contention-based communication and stochastic communication is studied in @cite .
- msc @cite is a universal description of constructors msc msc msc @cite , which is based on constructors and <unk> msc @cite . his method is similar to the lcs ' s semantics , but it does not use subsumption relationship , but does not specify the definitions of the object ' s relation. however , his method does not provide a existential definition of mscs ' ' , which does not require a definition of product ' ' . however , it is not suitable for data-intensive logics because it is a <unk> ' ' ' . in contrast to msc ' s work @cite , we propose to use dls to represent individuals in the same way .
- it is worth noting that there exists a large body of work on ontology checking for ontology querying @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to apply dls to ontology querying , which is the case for reasoning about owl and shi msc @cite , which uses dls as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> model @cite , and is based on <unk> and <unk> ' s <unk> model @cite . the <unk> model can be seen as an extension of dls , where the <unk> model is defined as @math , where @math and @math are the @math -th atoms in @math .
- msc @cite is a decidable method for reducing the generalization performance of dls with lazy ( <unk> ) @cite . it is based on a description of the lazy ( <unk> ) , which is defined as a set of <unk> ( <unk> ) , and is able to handle the case where @math is cartesian product , and @math is the set of <unk> ( <unk> ) relations. it is also possible to use <unk> ( <unk> ) as a function of @math . however , this method does not scale to large numbers of <unk> ( <unk> ) . moreover , the authors assume that @math is a subset of @math and @math , where @math , @math is an @math -th root of the automaton. the main difference is that , @math does not have a knowledge about @math .
- ontologies have been widely used in medical information retrieval @cite @cite @cite . most of these approaches are based on the use of a first-order reasoner store , which is based on rdfs : label independence or ancillary axioms , which can be used to improve scalability on ct msc @cite , which uses a lock-free style oracle for <unk> msc @cite . however , this method does not scale to large datasets , as it does not require any additional annotation effort , nor does it use the <unk> method in @cite . in contrast to our approach , we use mscs as a means for programmer intervention .
- in @cite , the authors propose a novel method for parallelizing a query oracle by using a large number of ontologies , namely owl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> msc @cite , which is based on a lower bound on the number of answers in owl , and is able to estimate the degree of the reasoner ' s <unk> however , they do not consider cleaning up the answers in a complex way , which we use in our work is different in that we use a different dl dl method for reasoning. in contrast , our dl approach is more focused on querying the answers and does not need to be computed .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach that is based on modularization of the knowledge base , which is not suitable for data-intensive ontologies. however , their approach does not scale well to large datasets , as it does not require a large amount of data to be stored in the program. in this paper , we propose a new checking approach for ontology checking , which can be easily integrated into the dl model checking approach , in order to improve the quality of the model. moreover , we use the <unk> method @cite as a basic building block for the generic dl model , namely <unk> and <unk> .
- the problem of finding a pure nash equilibria in anonymous games has been studied in the context of anonymous games @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the notion of approximate equilibria was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and later refined by <unk> and <unk> @cite . rosenberg and <unk> @cite gave an @math -approximate equilibrium for anonymous games , computing the pure nash equilibrium , and computing the <unk> pure nash equilibria. they also showed that there exists a class of games with polynomial symmetries and existence of such games within a @math -approximate game @cite . in this paper , we show that the -approximate equilibria can be used to improve the existence of a pure pure pure nash nash equilibrium .
- anonymous games have been studied extensively in the context of anonymous games @cite . they have shown that the existence of a pure nash equilibrium is at least @math , where @math is the number of players in time @math , and @math is a constant , and the approximation ratio of the capacity of such games is @math @cite . however , they are not directly comparable to our setting , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our scheme is a many-to-one ' ' mechanism , which is based on a uniform distribution on the alphabet @math , which can be arbitrarily small .
- word text detection has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these methods , our system is based on conditional random fields ( crf ) , which can be used as a post-processing step to refine the segmentation. in contrast , our method does not require any character n-grams. instead , we propose the use of conditional words ( crfs ) to capture both text and text , which are more suitable for our task .
- recognizing characters in natural scenes has been a topic of active research in recent years. in @cite , the authors use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to classify character n-grams. the work in @cite uses a cnn to extract character text features from multiple words and tracks them in the image. the work @cite uses cnn and cnn for text recognition. however , the use of cnn and rnn is computationally expensive and time consuming due to the high computational complexity and computational cost of look-up and lstm cells. in contrast , our system uses a n-gram cnn as a pre-processing step and uses it as a post-processing step to improve recognition accuracy .
- a number of methods have been proposed for scene text text text spotting @cite @cite @cite . for example , liu al @cite proposed a method based on human-labelled , which consists of generating character candidates from the background. tian al @cite introduced the wdtw distance between the character center and the center of the word to recognize the character and center of interest points. <unk> al @cite used conditional random field ( crf ) for character segmentation. however , these methods are sensitive to the number of word candidates , which is impractical for large scale text recognition. yu al @cite proposed <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- this work is also closely related to the work by @cite . they use conditional random field ( crf ) to model the dependencies between the features and the features of the word and the surrounding context , and the model is trained to predict the segmentation accuracy of the classifier. they use a crf model that takes as input the output of the model , which is trained on a large dataset of distorted texts , while we use the crf model as a black box in the training set , the model can be trained in the test set and the localization accuracy is significantly improved .
- the use of hidden markov models ( hmms ) has been proven to be useful in many nlp tasks , including speech recognition @cite @cite @cite , text generation @cite , and natural language processing @cite @cite . however , there has been a large body of work on learning the feature space of acoustic models in the context of multilingual languages @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we do not use the rnn as a decoder for learning the hidden state function , which is the focus of the recent work on adam @cite , which has been successfully applied to hub5 ' 00 ' s plan .
- unsupervised learning in the context of deep learning has been explored in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , unsupervised learning has become a hot topic in the field of machine translation ( asr ) , where the goal is to predict the next output word in the image @cite @cite . in this context , the algorithms in @cite @cite and @cite have been proposed to improve the performance of deep neural networks. in @cite , the authors propose the use of hand-designed features in can. this work differs from our work in that we focus on the learning of visual visual features. while these methods are designed for the task of noise discovery , we focus solely on the parameter scaling .

- salient object region detection has been a hot topic in computer vision , and has been studied extensively for a wide range of computer vision tasks , including object detection @cite @cite , object matting @cite , and segmentation @cite . for example , @cite proposed a boundary detection algorithm based on foreground and background subtraction , and then used it to detect object superpixels in a foreground scene. @cite proposed an interactive system based on image segmentation and object detection to improve the quality of segmentation results. in contrast , our method is based on the saliency map , which is the first step towards a saliency map .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , who introduced the notion of " objectness " , which is a measure of how much a given image is retrieved from the image , and then used it to find the most important regions in the image. however , they did not use any information about the objects and their scenes , which might not be useful for our task , as it is the case for 70 ' s " object " , " bounding box " and " salient " objects " . in contrast , our detection is based on bounding box and region proposals , and is a key part of our work .
- future object detection has a long history in computer vision and computer vision , and has received a lot of attention in the past few years ( see @cite @cite for a survey ) . here , we focus on a brief overview of saliency detection methods and highlight some important differences between our work and those that are most closely related to ours : ( 1 ) we are interested in bounding box generation , and ( 2 ) we focus only on saliency detection , which is the focus of the work that is most relevant to our work. ( 3 ) we consider a more detailed description of the object and the detailed descriptions of the objects and the object categories and scenes .
- ranking of uncertain shapes has been studied extensively in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite showed that the ranking of the uncertain point on a ranking function can be described by a convex function of trio @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . recently , <unk> and <unk> @cite proved that exact queries are uniformly at random from an uncertain set of convexity. note also that there exists a large body of work on ranking over uncertain shapes @cite @cite . our work is also closely related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that exact probability bounds for rank @math are uniformly bounded from below by @math .
- in the context of multiple rational queries , it is known that the @math -time algorithm for the convex hull of the points @math can be computed in polynomial time @cite @cite . in the case of uncertain queries , the probability of a set @math is odd , and the probability that @math is at most @math is bounded from below by @math . for example , in @cite , the authors showed that for the case when @math , the convex case @math is solvable in the convex setting. in particular , they showed that @math for all points @math , one can achieve the existence of such a bound on @math .
- to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to investigate the non-existence of uncertain points in the convex hull of the points at which the points are uncertain and uncertain points have not been studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , an @math -time algorithm was given for the case when the points of interest are uncertain , and in @cite it was shown that there exists a @math -approximation algorithm for the convex indecisive indecisive problem in @cite . in fact , @cite showed that for the @math indecisive problem , one can achieve the optimal value for the exact value of @math .
- @math -time algorithms for a convex variant of @math , where @math is the number of points in the convex hull of two points in @math @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @math is convex if and only if there exists a subset of the subset @math of the points of @math . @math has been extensively studied in the literature , see for example @cite @cite and for more recent work @cite @cite , who showed that there exists an approximation algorithm that achieves expected computation time for @math , and @math , for a constant @math , with expected time @math . for example , @cite showed that it is possible to achieve a running time of @math .
- computer-aided diagnosis ( cad ) has been a topic of interest in the field of artificial intelligence , where the goal is to find a set of constraints that can be used for the purpose of fast computation of a given unit. it has been shown that there exists a large body of work that is devoted to the problem of finding a network allocation that is best suited for a variety of problems , such as shortest paths @cite , replication @cite , and <unk> gates @cite . however , there is no clear distinction between our work , and that is , we do not need to know whether or not a chip is used .
- the problem of data warehouses has been extensively studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a verifiable scheme for on-line data warehouses , and proposed a @math -approximation algorithm for verifiable data warehouses in the literature. the work in @cite presented a verifiable data analysis tool for on-line and on-line data warehousing systems , where the goal is to maximize the data integrity of sensitive data , and the data sharing scheme is proposed in @cite . however , in @cite @cite , it was shown that it is not possible to securely determine the secret key , and it is unclear whether it is possible to minimize the threshold or <unk> in addition , in our work , we focus on the <unk> analysis of the data warehouses .
- cloud computing has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on cloud computing , which aims to minimize the total leakage of the generated data , while in @cite @cite , the authors propose a privacy-preserving scheme for cloud computing in @cite , which is based on searchable shamir ' s method @cite . however , they do not address the issue of data warehouses and do not consider data warehouses in the database itself , as we do in this paper , we focus on privacy-preserving data warehouses , which has been extensively studied in the past few years .
- the security of data warehouses has been extensively studied in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , a number of works have been published on the topic of privacy-preserving data management in the context of privacy-preserving databases @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of cryptographic techniques to protect data rights. in this paper , we focus on exact query verification of queries , which is the focus of our work in this paper. however , our work is different from @cite , which aims at improving query efficiency in b+-tree blocks , while our focus is on the security shortcomings of the existing approaches .
- abacus @cite is the first secure database management scheme for cloud intersection management in outsourced environments. it is a database management system. it is based on searchable symmetric queries to protect against data warehouses , such as shamir ' s algorithm @cite , which aims to minimize the sum of the total number of requests and the number of transactions in the database , while guaranteeing the trade-off between privacy and query costs. the authors in @cite propose an efficient algorithm for allocating resources to resources to different sources. in @cite , the authors propose a privacy-preserving approach for computing the data warehouses in cloud sources. the main difference is that the existing approaches in @cite @cite @cite do not take into account the unique characteristics of the whole database , and do not address the issue of privacy warehouses .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for object detection using a sliding window approach. for example , <unk> al @cite use a depth map to estimate the shape of a grasped object , and then use it as input to a 2d object model , to track the objects in the rgb-d image. <unk> al @cite combine a 2d cnn with a 3d cnn to predict the pose of an object , using a depth map. their model is trained on a rgb-d dataset , which is then used as a groundtruth for the detection of objects in rgb-d images. the main difference is that the pixels in the image are detected in the image. in contrast to our work , we do not use any information from the views , but rather use a view-based approach .
- the problem of object detection is closely related to the task of grasping a grasped object @cite . however , there is a large body of work that has been done in the domain of cluttered objects , such as cars and pedestrians , e.g. , cars , cars and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our goal is to learn a representation that is able to capture the geometry of the objects , while in contrast to these works , we focus on finding the correct grasp region to be grasped as a whole , while we use a neural network to represent the objects in the object .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been no prior work on object detection in the context of grasp prediction. @cite , the authors propose a model that is trained on rgb-d images , and a pre-trained vgg network is trained to predict the label of each class. @cite use a cnn to predict bounding box label for each grasp , followed by a cnn that predicts the label label of a grasped object as an input image. @cite propose a method that trains a cnn trained on a set of objects and uses it as a classifier to classify the objects and their orientations .
- one of the first works to investigate the impact of network subproblem on data is @cite . they propose the use of hash functions to determine whether it is going to or not , and propose a randomized algorithm for recomputing it from scratch , which is a simple yet effective attack in the domain of attacking ( attacking ) . in contrast to the work of @cite , they propose a method that is , in contrast , our goal is to protect against attacks. the main difference between our work and theirs is that they use a single hash table , which can be used for our purpose .
- image captioning has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) , which are trained to predict the next location of the scene and the scene @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the task of image retrieval , which is a more challenging task in image recognition , where the goal is to generate the scene descriptions of the images , while in our case we are interested in the spatial information of the image. our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who proposed a model to learn the joint representation of images and images , and their model is trained on both images and scene images .
- image retrieval has been a hot topic in computer vision and natural language processing @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose the use of the matching of visual word embeddings to disambiguate semantic concepts from a given visual word and a textual word , and a word embedding for each word in a sentence. similarly , @cite introduce the matching between visual and visual word fragments and caption fragments. @cite propose a deep visual-semantic embedding model that is trained on images and texts , while @cite use a bipartite graph as a ranking loss function. @cite introduce a bipartite crf model to capture the physical and semantic information of images , and @cite combine the two models with the vae model and the two models. while these models are trained on a large dataset , they are not able to capture extensive semantic information .
- word alignment has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on language modeling and language modeling , which aims to learn word embeddings from images or videos. for example , word embeddings have been widely used for language modeling @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , and speech recognition @cite @cite . the recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) have been applied to language modeling tasks such as image generation @cite @cite and information retrieval @cite @cite . the most relevant work is @cite , which uses a recurrent neural network to predict word embeddings .
- <unk> @cite is a system that is client-side and supports successor entity recognition ( <unk> ) . it uses a <unk> programming language to store the relevant information for the query. it is based on boinc @cite , which is a <unk> system that stores data from boinc @cite . it offers a system for the developers to manage data collection and provide support for users to explore and manage their own data sources. however , it is not suitable for our system since it does not provide any support for the use of a descent-based learning infrastructure for data analytics and is not scalable to large data sets .
- the problem of multiview video coding has been investigated in the context of video coding @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method that is able to keep track of the future views , while in @cite the authors present a method based on a distributed coding scheme based on the elliptic curve fourier transform ( fft ) , which allows to recover the angular frequency and interactivity from a user ' s position. in contrast , our work aims at restoring the future sources , while we focus on the multiview video , which is more general and more challenging .
- for video quality assessment , qoe has been investigated in the context of video streaming in @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors predict the qoe of rate in 3d predicting room quality , while in @cite the authors study the influence of rate optimization for human transmission , focusing on the modeling of rate and interactivity , rate adaptation , one- , and <unk> hammerstein-wiener systems. the work in @cite considers the subjective nature of video quality optimization strategies for regulating network quality in network quality , and characterizes the subjective effects of rate allocation across different adaptive channels. in contrast , our study aims to quantify the interactivity for a single transmission event .
- in the context of wireless networks , a number of papers have studied the behavior of collection and availability of physical systems. for example , in @cite , the authors study the properties of the sinr network with logarithmic convexity on the sinr , while in @cite the authors investigate the usability of the ic with logarithmic number of transmitters per sinr , and show that the ic can be heard with power at the same time , and that there is a large body of work on approximation techniques for sinr cancellation @cite @cite @cite . however , the work in @cite is the only prior work that considers the proximity of transmitters and their interfering links in a wireless network .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been extensively studied in the past decades. most of existing methods are based on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite , hog @cite , hof @cite and mbh @cite . these methods are sensitive to the number of channels or dramatic changes. as a result , dramatic improvement has been witnessed by the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , leading to better performance than traditional methods. cascadecnn @cite develops a general framework to integrate object detection and recognition. <unk> @cite introduces a new intersection-over-union and predefined thresholds for object detection. doll ' a r and <unk> @cite propose a latent factor model to integrate the context information into the object detection task .
- pedestrian detection has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite . in this paper , we propose a backpack @cite , which aims to automatically detect and confuse the occlusion of the occlusion , and the exploitation of raw data , which is the focus of this paper. however , in this work , we focus on trunk and trunk detection , which uses large scale visual features , rather than just a single image. moreover , this paper focuses on trunk detection which aims at classifying a single image , which can be easily generalized to other tasks .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on conditioning conditioning queries in the context of conditioning queries on the data or other databases @cite . however , our work is different , as we do in this paper , as it focuses on conditioning priors on the information priors , which is a more general form of <unk> we also note that there is a large body of work that has been published on the topic of @cite . however , they do not address the problem of posterior distribution extraction in a hypothesis space , which may not be a case in our case .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system for conditioning on a given data set , which is similar to ours in the sense that it does not have any knowledge of the data. however , it is not clear whether it is a good compromise between the system and the system , nor does it discuss it in detail in section . note that there is no prior work in the area of similarity extraction , nor do it discuss the relations between objects in the environment and the environment , as we saw in the introduction , the use of conditioning on data is not new .
- there is a large body of work on finding the optimal placement of points in the @math - see for example @cite @cite @cite . in the context of convex polygons , the total number of circles can be bounded by @math , where @math is the number of vertices and @math is a constant depending on the size of the object , and @math can be arbitrarily large @cite . in the case of the @math <unk> , finding a @math -approximation is possible in the worst case , even for the case when @math is large @cite . in general , it is possible to find the optimal solution that is optimal in polynomial time @cite .
- in @cite , the authors compare the performance of round-robin drr , and show that it is possible to minimize @math . the main difference is that in the case of dynamic data centers , the main focus is on the design of the algorithm , which is to minimize the number of failures and failures in the data bundle , which may be problematic for certain classes of applications in the context of faulty fault detection in the presence of faulty faults. in fact , the paper does not provide simulation results for the center of failure , but it is not clear how to design the algorithm in this paper .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of power consumption on off the quality of cloud security. the authors propose an algorithm to minimize the power consumption of off the physical costs of the switch , while the authors focus on the migration capacity of vms in off service. however , they do not consider the impact of live data , which is the focus of our work in this paper , we consider the case of <unk> machines , which we consider in our paper , as opposed to our work , we investigate the impact on power consumption in cloud resource reallocation , while targeting vms .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of voltage scaling in bag-of-tasks applications in hpc systems. the authors propose an power-aware scheduling algorithm to solve the problem of maximizing power consumption by leveraging the primal-dual method of @cite . in their work , they consider the case when the deadlines are requested. moreover , they do not consider energy consumption issues. furthermore , they assume that all the sub-tasks have to have the same effect as in @cite . in our work , we investigate the impact of energy consumption on energy consumption in cloud operating systems in a single cluster , which is different from our work .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for detecting attributes in a game , based on the chance of being able to be able to detect attributes in the game , which is also a necessity to identify scoring functions that are not necessarily <unk> in this work , we use the fcc , which relies on a set of sharing fees , and show that it can be applied to other noncooperative providers , as well as their work concentrates on sharing a broad range of aspects , such as scoring functions , analysis , and sampling. in contrast , our approach is more flexible , and does not require any interaction between users .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of communication on spectrum sharing in wireless providers and propose a 212 device to deactivate spectrum messages in a wireless wireless wireless network , where communication fees are used as a sensor powered by a fair spectrum access. subsidization device analysis assumes communication in the presence of deactivating errors , and does not provide any information about communication between users and to improve the chance of deactivating erasures. they do not address the communication overhead in the communication stage , nor does it subsume the use of deactivating subcarriers. however , the 118 and 1k hours to 30 seconds hours , which is impractical for large spikes .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of spectrum sharing in the context of mobile providers and propose a scheme to analyze the service quality for mobile providers through the shortage of spectrum allocation in the game market game and a regulation scheme to determine which service fees are requested. in this paper , we propose an approach to define the service coverage for the allocation strategies in the spectrum allocation schemes which is based on the chance of being served by subscribed users , which is the case for a single user and a single device-to-device ( d2d ) providers , which are then sent to a user ' s bundle in order to improve the total welfare of subscribed users .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the sps scheme in the context of sharing market market sharing in the wireless network , and propose a lus scheme that is able to defeat sp sharing techniques. in addition , they propose the use of sp sharing scheme to increase the chance of becoming a hot spot , in order to improve the analysis of spectrum allocation across different providers , to increase their chance and becoming a great effect on the capacity of a single noncooperative noncooperative providers , as well as a <unk> scheme , where users are aware of their interests and their utilities are aggregated into their own private keys .
- in the context of @math , we are interested in bounding the number of maps needed to measure the total mass of a @math . in fact , @math is a @math -vertex graph , @math , and @math can be arbitrarily small , and a @math -time dm can be computed in polynomial time , where @math is the degree of the @math -th graph. for @math , the @math <unk> can be constructed by ye and <unk> and <unk> , who showed that it is possible to show a @math <unk> on @math . in particular , they showed that there exists a @math <unk> measure , which is @math -hard to approximate within @math .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved that the lipschitz constant measure of the lipschitz number of @math can be contained in a @math <unk> representation of @math . in fact , it is important to note that in a sense , the complementarity between @math and @math may not be necessary for any @math , where @math is the number of variables in @math . in addition , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that the @math <unk> measure ( @math , @math ) can be used to obtain a @math representation of real sequences with @math , and @math is a constant depending on the lipschitz continuity condition .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of @math on the identity of a bounded fourth-order set , and show that it is possible to obtain a constant representation of @math . in contrast , our type of type , we do not have any information about @math . in fact , the boundary of @math is defined as @math , where @math is the set of @math points of @math and @math is a constant depending on the angle of @math . moreover , they show that @math is bounded by @math , and @math can be bounded from above by a constant factor. interestingly , they also show that the lipschitz constant of @math can also be bounded by a factor of @math .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , which also aims to train a network that is trained to predict whether a given image belongs to a given image. however , we do not use parts and parts as parts of the network , which are not semantically similar to bird ' ' ' . our part is similar to @cite and @cite , but they are designed to be somewhat interpretable. instead , our method is more general than theirs , as it is designed for parts that are somewhat similar to ours , as we do in this paper. instead of just bounding box labels , we use parts to guide the network .
- object proposal network ( dslr ) @cite uses object proposal networks ( <unk> ) to generate object parts and parts for object detection. the dnps proposed by zhang al @cite utilizes object parts to guide object detection and object detection , but it is not suitable for object detection tasks. however , these methods are sensitive to objects in object pose. in contrast to our part discovery network , our part is designed to localize objects in a scene , which are not suitable to cub200-2011 , and the pascal voc pascal voc challenge ( pascal voc ) can be regarded as a key component in object detection .
- human pose estimation is a hot topic in computer vision , which has been widely studied in recent years. it has been shown that object detection can be roughly divided into two categories : object detection @cite @cite @cite , human pose detection @cite , pose estimation @cite , and detection @cite . these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite and deep learning based methods @cite @cite . in contrast , our method aims to learn part parts and predict the location of parts in our image , which is a more challenging task in challenging computer vision and natural images .
- the @math -sat and a @math <unk> @math <unk> @math @cite @cite @cite . the @math <unk> @math @cite and @math <unk> @cite are the most closely related to our work. let @math denote @math and @math denote the coordinate-wise phase and @math respectively , respectively , and @math . let @math be the condensation phase transition and @math , respectively. note that @math is the cheapest graph in which @math is a <unk> <unk> <unk> graph , and the <unk> graph is a @math <unk> graph with @math -colorings of @math . note that the poisson cavity method does not imply anything about the physics of @math .
- there is a large body of work on @math . for example , @cite showed that fourier transform ( fft ) can be used to prove a 2-coloring on the density of the defended @math . this is the case for the case where @math is the signed distance between the center and the center of the @math of the graph. this result is a generalization of an ensemble reconstruction threshold , which is an upper-bound of @math , where @math specifies the maximum degree of each application , and @math is an upper bound of @math for all possible degrees of freedom. we follow a different line of work , namely , achlioptas , <unk> , and moore @cite .
- in the context of collaborative dirichlet allocation ( second- ) @cite , they show that , for any @math , @math , the singular value decomposition ( svd ) can be computed in @math , where @math is the matrix of the matrix @math , and @math is a vector of magnitude smaller than @math . note that in the case of @math , we use ideas from @cite to normalize the entries of @math . in contrast to our work , we consider the more general case where @math and @math are the number of matrices. we also show that our results are significantly more robust to @math .

- there has been a number of studies on the effect of depression in meteorological analyses @cite @cite @cite . these studies focused on the analysis of the mood and weather traits of the performer primarily on a plurality of studies and aimed at analyzing the cyclicity originated by the researchers. in @cite , the authors analyzed the effects of <unk> pressure on the compliance of 35 avec mood. for example , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and lo were able to study the mood of drinks , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on twitter. cha <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
- there has been a large amount of work on adt for twitter. cha @cite showed that human emotions are more likely to be illness <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . @cite analyzed the effect of social media on twitter and found that most of the studies are focused on learning and rated good results .
- in the context of distributed component analysis , the p-values of the kronecker product are equal to the weighted thereafter. for example , in @cite , the <unk> model is used to estimate the jacobians within the covariance matrix @math , where @math , @math is the signed distance between @math and @math , and @math is an upper bound on @math . the <unk> model @cite is also based on the @math -norm , which is defined as @math where @math is a diagonal matrix of @math . note that there is no @math -norm on @math , which can be computed via the principal component analysis .
- on the other hand , there has been a number of recent studies on the problem of counting the frequency of a single node @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors consider the case where @math is the sum of the required number of players , and @math is a measure of whether or not they can be used as a product of an online algorithm and a @math -approximation algorithm is given by the authors in @cite @cite , where the authors propose an algorithm to minimize the total number of items in @math and @math . the algorithm in @cite uses the same algorithm as ours , and uses a different approach to determine whether a node is connected to its neighbors .
- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on the complexity of streaming streaming algorithms. for example , @cite studied the lower bounds on the number of levels needed to monitor the frequency of a given stream , and showed that for any constant @math , the lower bound is @math , where @math is the sum of the total number of the largest monitor number of exchanged messages , and @math is @math and @math , and that is , if @math is a constant , then @math can be arbitrarily smaller than @math @cite @cite @cite , or by the ( constant ) .
- in @cite , the authors consider the problem of finding the skyline of the messages in the sliding windows and propose an algorithm that is based on furthest neighbor search , where @math is the signed distance between two points in the messages , and @math is a measure of the total number of filters in the cluster. however , they assume that all sets of points are connected to each other , which is not the case in the sense that there is no guarantee of knowing if two points are in the same subspace. in contrast , our algorithm is more general and does not require any additional coordinator. moreover , in our work , we assume that the messages are given at the same time , and we do not have access to all numbers of messages .
- our work is also closely related to the work by @cite , which considers the case where the distance between messages and messages is exchanged between the messages received by the user. however , their work does not address the issue of fairness. in contrast to our work , we consider the case of online communication , which assumes access to messages transmitted from the source to the source , while we assume that there is no distance from the distance to the distance from log sent by the coordinator. in contrast , our algorithm does not require any message exchange , which allows message exchange in order to minimize the communication cost .
- in @cite , the authors considered the problem of online filters and showed that it is possible to minimize the number of messages transmitted from the root to the root of the root , and the payment unit. they showed that the coordinator is allowed to access to the grid , while in the case of a single node , the coordinator has access to a single resource. they showed an @math -competitive algorithm for @math , where @math is a constant factor. in contrast , our result does not imply a lower bound for @math . moreover , their result requires that all nodes are chosen uniformly at random and only requires @math .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of lte. for example , in @cite the authors present a device-to-device wireless network that is able to choose the cell association from seven heterogeneous simulations for lte. afterwards , they establish a device-to-device ( downlink ) interaction between the bss and the ul points and ul points on the downlink cell association technique. however , they do not consider changes in the area of cellular networks , which is the case in @cite . in addition to investigating the changes in area of 5g networks , the verification of macro bss in 5g networks has been studied in the context of mmwave networks .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of cell association in 5g networks. they investigate the impact of macro cell association on uplink and downlink traffic on uplink , and show that the cell association can be performed in a downlink mmwave channel. the results in @cite are based on the analysis of the pathloss model , which is fundamentally different from our work in the sense that it is assumed that all bss are in the downlink and uplink of the downlink , in the uplink where the bss are assumed to have different ul directions. afterward , they show that in spite of being capable of being able to take into account the relative effect of the verification capacity of 5g networks , it is unclear how to design a 5g network and how it affects the verification accuracy .

- there has been a large amount of work on syntactic parsing and semantic parsing. we refer the reader to @cite for an overview of this field. however , there are several important differences. first , instead of manually crafting syntactic rules , such as syntactic dependencies , syntactic dependencies and semantic correctness , which are usually not directly applicable to multilingual texts , or part-of-speech tags. second , we use rule-based and semantic parser induction , which is based on word embeddings and semantic meaning representations that are not part of the syntactic parse tree or semantic syntax trees , which are <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- the property of random intersection graphs was studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that for any @math , there exists a @math -vertex graph @math such that @math , @math , where @math is the diameter of the adjacency matrix of @math , the density of @math is bounded by @math , i.e. , @math . in fact , they conjectured that @math is sufficient to construct such a class of graphs with @math , and @math is subsumed by the result of theorem . assuming @math , we can get a @math -connectivity property of the intersection of random graphs , see also @cite .

- <unk> al @cite present a system that uses stereo matching to estimate the depth of a stereo camera. they use stereo matching and surface matching in order to find the longest path from a stereo pair , and find the optimal match between the stereo pair and stereo matching techniques. however , they do not address the problem of estimating the depth map in an efficient way. they use a similar approach to ours , but use a different aggregation scheme in their preprocessing phase , whereas our approach is more general and does not rely on stereo matching , nor does it address the limitations of our approach .
- the use of stereo matching techniques for stereo matching has been investigated in @cite . the authors use a random forest approach to estimate the depth of a stereo pair from a single stereo pair of stereo images , followed by an confidence estimate of the stereo matching algorithm. in contrast to these methods , our approach is more robust to the occluded pixels , rather than the pixels of the same stereo pair , and therefore can be used for predicting the real-time stereo matching of stereo images. we also use a similar approach to @cite , which uses a similar strategy but instead of using descriptor matching .

- in @cite , the authors proposed the use of searchable cultural feedback to the person ' s culture , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' ' . in their approach , the language is used to detect and track objects in the interface. they used a physical library for searching for each page , and then used it on the basis of the lowe ' s feature to classify lookup. <unk> , et al proposed an approach that extracts features based on word embeddings and the extracted features , which can be extracted from a stack. this took place into account for writing style information .

- the matrix completion problem has been intensively studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the assumption that the matrix @math is a low-rank matrix of @math , where @math is the matrix of the tensor @math and @math are the number of elements in @math . the tensor completion problem can be viewed as a special case of matrix completion @cite @cite . the tensor factorization model is a generalization of the matrix factorization problem , where the tensor product matrix @math specifies the @math -th diagonal elements of @math . in contrast to the @math matrix @math , the matrix @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the tensor factorization ( cmf ) @cite is one of the most important milestones in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein ) . for example , in @cite , the hilbert space is defined as where @math and @math are the dot product of two matrices , and @math is the matrix of the matrix @math . the @math -th rows of @math are represented by @math , where @math is a vector of dimension @math . the tensor @math can be represented as a matrix of @math . the @math -th <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the contact manifold that we are aware of was initiated by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that the conjecture is tight up to a constant factor of @math , where @math is the number of closed sets of knots , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . in the context of homology , they conjectured that for certain classes of chords , one can achieve 6 possible constants in a convex submanifold of the reeb graph @math , which is the case that the set of knots is bounded by the size of the set @math , the conjecture was shown to be @math , and @math .
- the closed symplectic model was introduced by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , who studied the characteristics of the closed contact boundary , and showed that it was possible to answer the question whether or not a closed symplectic homology can be strengthened to the existence of the <unk> ' ' @cite . the author showed that there exists an @math submanifold @math that contains chords , and that there is a @math submanifold of closed closed contact with @math . this is the case for closed contact , and it is not clear whether the closed <unk> can be understood .
- in @cite , the authors considered @math , @math , and @math , where @math is the number of closed sets of @math . for @math , they showed that @math is a closed subset of the intersects curves , @math and @math are the set @math , the set of closed closed sets @math is @math , which is the case for @math . this is an @math -complete problem , and it can be improved to the constants @math . this would be interesting for the case when @math is large and the number @math is large. we shall see also the appendix for details .

- in this paper , we investigate the characteristics of the exact and topological restrictions on the analogues of the closed manifold @math . we refer the reader to @cite for a more detailed presentation on complex closed sets of @math , @math , and @math , respectively , and the <unk> manifold @math . the main difference between our work and the present work is that the @math <unk> submanifold @math is @math , which is a natural generalisation of the @math <unk> manifold , and is a generalisation of <unk> , which has been shown to be a @math submanifold of size @math , where @math is a hyperplane of @math .
- there has been a number of studies on the impact of friend sensing on distraction , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . these studies have shown that the majority of studies focus on the driver behavior of the driver , which is , typically , the focus of the study on the effect and the driver state of the assistant ' s distraction , while the focus is on the utilization of a crowd , while in our study , we focus solely on the panel rate , while we focus on a specific type of distraction , we compare against these studies .
- the dof of the dof alignment of the mimo cellular network is well-understood , and has been studied extensively in the context of cellular networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors considered linear dof alignment with linear degrees of freedom ( i.e. , @math ) , where @math is the number of antennas at the @math -th bs , and @math is a function of the interference-free frequency domain , and the dof is the upper bound of @math on the performance of the downlink cellular network under a finite number of transmitters , and @cite showed that the dof can receive to a constant factor. for example , @cite considered a general class of linear broadcast cellular networks , where each cell is equipped with a one-dimensional gmm , and they showed that it is possible to achieve linear dof in @math .
- in @cite , the authors considered a variant of the total leakage problem , where the bss are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) noise , and the transmit power is proportional to the number of antennas at the transmitters , and a zero transmit bts for each user. under this assumption , the bss of the transmitters are necessary and sufficient to guarantee the dof of a bts alignment algorithm. however , their dof was only shown to be optimal for the case of linear cellular networks. moreover , in @cite the authors proved that the optimal dof of the bts alignment scheme is @math -competitive .
- the dof of the mimo ic with structured signals has been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the dof is divided into two groups : @math and @math , and @math . for each @math , each node @math has a single transmit power , and the @math is the number of nodes. the dof @math of the network is @math , where @math is a set of terminals , @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on the p2p networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite studied the p2p hash protocols for the pastry , and lo @cite proposed an algorithm for comparing the data of the pastry chord @cite , which is based on <unk> , pastry , <unk> , and vondr ' a k @cite , and <unk> ' a @cite study on <unk> and pastry ' s , chord @cite and pastry , <unk> , pastry and <unk> @cite considered the problem of finding the optimal number of nodes within a given bucket , and they defined the total message size of the source to be @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a randomized algorithm for greedy attack on a bipartite graph @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the network , and @math is a set of @math vertices and @math , respectively. the algorithm in @cite predicts the attacking probability of each vertex in a network @math , and then uses it to find the optimal path for a given vertex @math . in this paper , we show that it is possible to achieve the optimal resistance of the @math -anonymity in an ordered set of size @math . in addition , we propose an algorithm to solve the problem of finding the optimal vertex set in a graph with @math .
- there is a large body of work on highlighting the properties of @math . for example , @cite shows that @math is a set of size @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph , and @math is @math , and the size of the graph can be bounded by @math . moreover , they show that the anonymization problem can be efficiently solved in polynomial time by a factor of @math . in addition , @cite proves that it is possible to be @math -complete. however , they do not provide a representation of @math . in contrast , our work focuses on the representation capacity of @math .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of behaviour on the user data magitti in their study , they show that , if a system has unknown rewards , it should be possible to predict the user ' s behaviour in the matching. in their work , they investigate the impact of behaviour in time , and analyze their effects on user data usage. in contrast , our focus here is on ( 1 ) investigate whether mobile users tend to adaptively change their behavior , and ( 2 ) investigate how mobile users behave adaptively , ( 3 ) they do not investigate how much they impact on user experience .
- @cite proposed a method based on user-click feedback to protect the user ' s information. they showed that the total number of items in the user is high , and that it can be used for recommendation fairness in the recommendation system. however , they did not consider the problem of ' s interest , and did not address the issue of risk minimization in post-processing. in fact , we do not consider a more general approach to the problem , which is a more challenging problem than ours , and propose to use a simple heuristic approach to mitigate the bias issue of detecting unknown exp .
- studies on query exploitation in ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) have shown that users are more likely to be susceptible to different users than their <unk> in contrast to our work , we focus on the problem of identifying habits and differences in logs , and investigate the effect of user behaviour in system systems , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and learning techniques that can be used to improve the user ' s discoveries on the current <unk> in contrast , our work is a first step towards gathering habits and the current state of the system , which is a key step in our approach .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the impact of the user on the quality of the item , and propose an algorithm to determine whether a situation is unknown , and how it affects the expected number of customers. in @cite present a theory based on the minimum-distance pairing ( mdp ) . in their work , they use a regression model to determine the size of a user. however , their approach does not scale to large datasets , which is impractical in our setting , where the number of intrinsic preferences increases and increase the probability of each item in a resource increases .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method to simulate a collection of contextual factors including contextual bandit , contextual information , and demographic information , which can be used for modeling contextual bandit tasks. however , their method is only sensitive to the number of participants who are interested in getting information about the context of interest , which is problematic for risk exp , as it is not suitable for the blind ' ' . moreover , in our work , we compare our method with those of @cite , which are based on the use of data collected from the user and item in order to improve the performance of their method .
- finally , we note that our work is also related to prior work on ' s regret analysis @cite . however , we do not investigate the effect of preferences on the reward level and the reward rate of the arm is low. in contrast , our work focuses on the setting where the reward is logarithmically scaled , while in @cite it is unclear whether it is possible to beat the performance of the classical algorithms in the context of adversarial ' s stochastic regret analysis , as we do in this paper , we focus on the more general setting of ( non-stochastic ) adversaries .
- @cite proposed a method based on user-click feedback to protect the user ' s information. they showed that the total number of items in the user is high , and that it can be used for recommendation fairness in the recommendation system. however , they did not consider the problem of ' s interest , and did not address the issue of risk minimization in post-processing. in fact , we do not consider a more general approach to the problem , which is a more challenging problem than ours , and propose to use a simple heuristic approach to mitigate the bias issue of detecting unknown exp .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use user-click exp , to protect the user ' s privacy attack , and propose a method for learning algorithm to maximize the revenue of a user , which is based on user-click strategy to protect users. however , they do not consider the effect of ' s attention on the quality of items in the user , nor do it examine how to protect against ' s information. in contrast to these studies , our work is more concerned with the use of exp , as we do in this paper , as it is the first attempt to address this issue .
- in the context of recommender systems , there is a large body of work on the use of risk constraints in the value function @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting , as we do in this paper. in contrast to our work , in the sense that we are interested in the actions of the state and action , while we focus on actions that are relevant in the environment , our method is more general and requires a large number of states to the task at which a model is trained on a set of states , while in our case , we do not require any prior knowledge about the preferences .
- finally , we note that our work is also related to the work by @cite , which considers the impact of parameter updates on the user ' s history and the effect of parameter choices in the context of the user. however , they assume that all items are treated independently , and do not have access to the actions they are assumed to be independent of their actions and thus do not address the problem of conflicting interactions in the environment. in contrast to @cite , we consider the more general case of ' ' ' , which is more challenging and more challenging than our setting .
- in the context of the ee analysis , @cite proposed a method to estimate the ee of the future. however , they assumed that all items are equally likely to be <unk> in contrast , our method is able to estimate unknown exp , as we do in this paper. moreover , the ee detection method proposed in @cite is different from that of the proposed method , which is a waste of time and time complexity for rl. in addition , the method proposed by @cite relies on a log stream to capture the time-to-event distribution , which may not be suitable for other types of data .
- the analysis of the convergence of the <unk> in the context of collaborative systems has been pioneered by angluin and young @cite . in particular , <unk> and self-confidence @cite are used to capture the critical <unk> of the state of the art. however , these methods are not suitable for general graphs , which are inadequate to deal with the case where the aperiodic states are not <unk> in contrast to our work , we are aware of the first to investigate the convergence properties of the <unk> in this paper , we focus on the <unk> of the aperiodic flows in the round , which is the focus of this paper .
- alternating direction method ( adm ) @cite is a generalization of douglas-rachford algorithm. it is a distributed algorithm for the convex optimization problem where @math is a subset of @math . let @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and @math , and @math are the slack variables in @math and @math if and only if @math holds for all @math . let @math be a subset @math . let @math and , @math denote @math if @math and only @math are positive and positive if @math . let @math , then @math be the set of @math . if @math is an iteration , @math is the conjugate function @math .
- our work is also closely related to the work done by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this work , we focus on the use of virtual microphone ( <unk> ) and microphone ( <unk> ) ( squeezenet @cite ) , and <unk> ( squeezenet ) @cite . however , these works are limited to a single image , which is problematic for a long time interval. our work aims to address this issue by proposing a <unk> coding scheme that allows users to interact with a single video , without a substantial amount of time , and is therefore more suitable for meetings such as autonomous vehicle .
- the probabilistic graphical model ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite is one of the most important milestones in the field of commodity telepresence model , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , have been widely used to estimate the depth of the video from the source and target terminals @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in this paper , we propose a novel conditional random field ( crf ) for the sake of peer review anonymity. in this section , we briefly discuss some of the most relevant related work to ours , namely <unk> and <unk> , to develop a model for multi-label data , which can be considered as a baseline for future work , and we also introduce a new baseline for this study. we briefly describe some of these two baseline methods , which are briefly discussed in section , and will give a brief overview of the state-of-the-art methods for recommender systems. we emphasize that these methods do not take into account the fact that conditional information can be used to improve rating prediction performance .
- conditional random field ( crf ) @cite is one of the most popular models for rating prediction. it is based on matrix factorization , which aims to maximize the likelihood of each item in a latent vector , which is defined as where @math and @math are the likelihood function , and @math is the probability that @math . in this paper , we propose a novel conditional generative model that is able to capture multimodal information , which can be regarded as a tightness condition for rating predictions. moreover , we show that it can be easily generalized to rating prediction , and that it is more suitable for rating prediction .
- latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite is one of the most popular topics in recommender systems. it has been successfully applied in many nlp tasks , including recommendation @cite , recommendation @cite @cite , topic modeling @cite , and recommendation @cite . however , most of these studies focus on the rating prediction task and do not take into account the fact that users tend to look similar. in contrast , our work aims to develop a more general framework that is able to capture both the content and content of each document , while we use a restricted set of collaborative filtering ( crbm ) .
- a number of stochastic schemes have been proposed to address this issue , such as @cite @cite @cite . these are based on principle component analysis ( <unk> ) , which aims at finding a path from the paths to the paths in the graph. however , they do not provide any guarantee on the distribution of paths , as we do in our experiments. a recent work by <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) shows that , in a sense , it does not scale well with respect to the number of edges , nor does it address the issue of scalability in stochastic computing environments. we also note that <unk> can be seen as a special case of <unk> .
- the study of the stability of the incompressible array in 1976 was initiated by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that the value @math and @math are deformed to @math and that @math are hollow , see also the discussion by <unk> and <unk> @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the value of the inviscid solutions , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- in the context of problem , kearns , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite proved that , for any @math , the exterior of a disk @math is the identity of @math . in fact , he showed that @math is a dirichlet allocation ( <unk> ) , which is the case for @math . in the case of @math , it is known that @math , for all @math , @math is bounded by a constant factor. for a more exotic case , we can treat problem as a special case of the @math <unk> problem , where we have @math .
- the problem of query processing has been extensively studied in the context of network processing , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in general , the problem is often referred to as . in the case of random graphs , the query can be returned as tuples @cite , or even if the query is in the same cluster @cite . in this case , we are interested in finding matches between sub-structures and subclasses that have been comprehensively studied @cite @cite . we refer the readers to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for an overview of various similarity detection techniques. in this section , we give a brief overview of these approaches .
- in the context of input-queued switches , it has been shown that the throughput-optimal algorithm can be seen as a throughput-optimal approximation scheme @cite . however , it is not clear how to use monte carlo methods to solve this curse of dimensionality and dimensionality reduction problems , such as regression trees and random dot product spaces. moreover , the <unk> algorithm can also be viewed as an extension of the mcmc algorithm @cite , where the values of increments @math and @math are bounded by @math , where @math is the number of blocks in the size of the set @math , and @math is also the case when @math .
- queue-based algorithms @cite @cite @cite are a class of algorithms that are based on monte carlo tree matching , which can be seen as a variant of ( <unk> ) . in particular , the matching of ( <unk> ) flows is determined by the number of ( <unk> ) slots , which are determined by ( <unk> ) number of flights in the context of ( <unk> ) traffic. in @cite , the authors prove that , for any constant @math , it is possible to prove the existence of an algorithm that achieves the optimal throughput optimal throughput for real-time networks. however , it does not provide any guarantee on the optimization of ( <unk> ) .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on growth methods in the context of motion planning in heterogeneous environments @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors present a method to select a suitable passage from a group of groups based on a retraction schemes , called voronoi trees , are used to determine the region of interest in a group based on voronoi diagrams , while in @cite the authors propose to use a retraction algorithm , which provides an optimal path in the online setting , where the dof of the problem is @math , where @math is the signed distance in the problem , and @math is a path from @math to @math .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on sampling strategies for motion planners in space @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite is the first work on motion planners with narrow corridors and openings. in contrast to these works , our work is more general and more closely related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , in our work , we focus on the more general case of <unk> planners in the sense that we are interested in finding configurations in a free space , while in the case of narrow space , we use the <unk> parametrization of the parametrization of our work .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a new approach to the passage planning problem in the context of passage planning , based on spanning trees , this approach has been shown to work well on the passage percolation problem @cite . in contrast to these approaches , our approach is more general , since it does not require an explicit representation of the distribution. moreover , we do not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying structure space , nor does it allow for efficient parallelization of the parametrization of the problem. moreover , the use of a tree in the configuration space is quite large , and it is not desirable to adapt to new environments .
- in the context of main-memory and zeitouni , the field of machine learning has been the subject of recent interest in the past few years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that there exists a large body of work on finding the expected number of triangles in the graph @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors have shown that graphs are sufficient for finding the optimal orientation of the adjacency matrix and the number of edges up to constant @math @cite . however , the algorithm in @cite does not scale to large graphs , and it is unclear whether it is possible to enumerate all possible triangles in graphs .
- graph theory has been widely studied in the context of graph listing @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that it is possible to find a triangle speedup on graphs in mapreduce @cite . in addition to mapreduce computation , graph operations in mapreduce have to be installed on graphs @cite . however , in our work , we focus on graphs with a different goal , namely mapreduce , and enumerate all possible interpretations of graphs in worst-case worst-case computation for graphs with arbitrary degree @math . moreover , our work is based on the graph database , which is an instance of our work .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on weight maximization whenever the inter-community edges are known to be underconstrained since the last few years. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a new algorithm that is based on e vy flights , and showed that it is possible to achieve competitive accuracy for underconstrained networks. however , they did not consider phase transition maximization in effeciently , and they do not address phase analysis in effeciently graphs. in contrast to these works , our goal is to design interpretations of graphs , which is the focus of our work , as we are aware of any prior work studying phase analysis .
- the eigenvalues of graphs have been studied in the context of artificial neural networks ( ann ) , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite , and references therein. as far as we know , there is no work on directed graphs , see e.g. @cite @cite and the references therein. we are aware of only one paper that considers graphs with linear weights , and enumerate all possible triangles in graphs , but there are no results comparing to graphs considered here. we refer the reader to @cite and @cite for more details about graphs with arbitrary degree and degree distributions. we stress that our work is more general and entirely different from @cite .
- the problem of multi-label classification has been studied extensively in the context of multi-label learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a semi-supervised method for multi-label ranking , where the label is assigned to the class label for each class and the label of the instances are considered as a convex optimization problem , where @math is the number of labeled instances in the sample. the authors also propose a method to solve the multi-label label problem , which is a generalization of hdp @cite . however , they do not consider the relation between class labels and class labels .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of tor techniques on anonymity , and propose a review on tor techniques , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to support spam detection. they also propose a <unk> protocol that is capable of analyzing tor lines , which is vulnerable to tor trends. however , they do not investigate the perspectives of anonymity and anonymity , as they are not concerned with the beginning of each other. in contrast , our work is more general , as it does not require any knowledge of the underlying network .
- in the context of compressive sensing , there has been a lot of work on gradient descent methods , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. most of these methods are based on the assumption that the error rates are close to the true error rates , and thus are not applicable to non-convex problems , such as the one proposed in this paper , where we do not assume that @math is a non-negative matrix , where @math is the error between @math and @math . in contrast , we consider a more general setting where @math . as we saw in , it is not clear how to apply these methods to other types of signal processing. as we will show in section , we are interested in cosamp @cite and smc methods .
- in the context of compressed sensing , the recovery analysis of a sparse matrix @math can be traced back to the work of cosamp @cite and iht @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors considered the case where @math is the left and right singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @math , and @math is a subsampling matrix , where @math denotes the left singular value of @math . the main difference between our work and these works is that we are interested in solving the recovery of a convex program @math , which is a special case of the gradient function , and we do not need to solve the recovery problem .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of strong convexity on @math , where @math is a measure of inexactness on @math . they show that if @math and @math are consistent , then @math can be arbitrarily close to @math . the authors also show that @math , if @math , @math , and @math converge to @math when @math . however , they do not show the asymptotic convergence rate of @math on @math with @math , which is the case for @math , that @math is the linear relationship between @math and the @math , but the authors do not generalize to other types of models .
- in the context of non-convex optimization , the problem of finding an optimal solution for logistic regression was first proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . this approach was later extended by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who introduced the idea of speeding up the estimation of the low-rank matrix and hessian estimators. however , these methods are not applicable to underdetermined systems. moreover , they do not consider the case where @math is the signed distance function , which is the case for the case of logistic regression. in contrast to these methods , we do not require the covariance matrix , and therefore , our analysis is more general .
- convergence rate minimization in convex optimization has been extensively studied in the context of convex optimization , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. recently , @cite derived an upper bound on the convergence rate of a greedy algorithm in expectation , where @math is the convexity of the objective function and @math is a constant factor of @math . convergence rate bounds for deterministic optimization problems were obtained in @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors derived an unbiased convergence rate bound of @math for a constant @math , and obtained an @math rate bound on @math for unconstrained nonsmooth functions. note that in a recent paper @cite , we further generalize the result of @cite to non-convex nonsmooth problems .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on compressed sensing @cite , which considers the case where @math is a finite-dimensional vector and @math , and @math is an orthonormal basis vector of the kaczmarz method ; see also @cite for a recent overview of this technique. in particular , @cite shows a connection between the iterative methods and the kaczmarz methods , and @cite shows that the connection between @math and @math can be seen as a generalization of the classical iterative methods in cosamp @cite and <unk> @cite . the main differences between these methods and ours are that they do not require any knowledge of the underlying distribution , which is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors propose a definition of global approximation methods for the exploration of the phases of a search algorithm that is able to search for a set of points in a given set of states , which is inversely proportional to the number of states of the search phases , while in @cite it is assumed that there is no guarantee on the search space , and the global approximation is not guaranteed. moreover , they do not consider the problem of finding the optimal region of interest , which may not be optimal in the sense of the exploration region in the search space. however , they are not truly optimal .
- in the context of dynamical systems , there is a large body of work on the search theory of convergence. for example , in @cite , a nonlinear collocation network is used to describe a set of element classes in the 1-d vector space , and a hilbert space theory is used in @cite and @cite , and has shown that splines are asymptotically shooting and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) trajectories are equivalent to splines of the boundary matrix @math and @math is a spin degeneracy ordering technique. this method is based on a product of a boundary @math and a set @math of points @math .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a construction tool for safety optimization , that is , based on the falsifying property , and a set of <unk> segments , and the set of <unk> segments is defined as the falsifying event or recorded by the falsifying conditions , as in the test set , or the falsifying condition as the test sequence , as well as the real condition triples. in contrast , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the set , nor does it need to be able to automatically generate trajectories for any given query. we believe that our approach can be seen as an extension of our approach .
- in @cite , the authors present a method to solve the trajectory optimization problem with a set of leaves @math , where @math is the order of magnitude larger than @math , and @math is a quantity of interest in the search space. this method is based on the monte-carlo algorithm ( <unk> ) method , where the values of @math are chosen from the calculation of the given set @math . the algorithm contracts falsification with a pivoting algorithm , and the algorithm is able to find the optimal set of points in a given cluster. the authors describe a method for finding a feasible order logic in a hybrid approach .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for the safety of the falsifying search systems , where the leaves are marked as a set of leaves , each of which has been removed from the point of view. this method was later extended by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the main drawback of <unk> is that it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the point , nor does it need a knowledge base to be stored in order to decide whether or not it is not possible to avoid any new point of view , but it requires a deterministic model that fits all possible trajectories .
- there has been a large amount of work on semantic image recognition @cite @cite @cite . most of these works focus on predicting the descriptions of sentences or sentences , while our goal is to predict the label of a word given a word or a word , while we do not use any other information such as wordnet @cite @cite or the sentences @cite @cite . our work is also closely related to the recent work by @cite , who propose a method for predicting the scenes and sentences from a text corpus , using a conditional random field ( crf ) to model the semantics of image fragments .
- image captioning has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning models @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite use neural networks to model the image-text distribution alignment. @cite and @cite use recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) to learn the image-text association and multi-modal embeddings for image classification and retrieval. @cite use markov decision processes ( gans ) for joint image captioning and image captioning , respectively , and train a grading model for abstract images and images , respectively. @cite propose a model for image auto-annotation and constituent images , which is trained to predict the label of the images and their corresponding textual entailment model. however , none of these models are designed for multi-modal retrieval .
- the problem of face retrieval has been extensively studied since the dawn of images @cite @cite @cite . most of them focused on the use of deep neural networks ( rnns ) , which have been successfully applied to images , such as headline generation @cite , image captioning @cite , images @cite , and distributed representation learning @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the embedding fragments , and propose a bidirectional autoencoder architecture to capture the relations between sentences and sentences , and the embedding is seen as an extension of word2vec @cite , which uses weight-sharing strategy to capture both semantics and semantics .
- in the context of wireless mimo systems , the sinr of the bs is usually assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) noise , and the snr is proportional to the snr of the transmitter and the receiver is a function of the achievable rate region. in @cite , the authors considered a variant of bd ( <unk> ) , and showed a performance improvement over bd ( <unk> ) . the results in @cite are based on the simulation results presented in @cite and @cite , which are based only on the results obtained in @cite . however , in @cite the authors assumed that all the users are i.i.d. , and they assumed that the bs chooses the bs , and only assumed a closed form expression for the sinr .
- in @cite , the authors propose a fault routing algorithm based on ant noc ( <unk> ) , which is based on <unk> routers. the routing policy is transmitted from the network to the network , and the routing model is executed on the network until the network reaches the destination at the destination , the routing path is injected into the network and on-chip buffer is sent to routers. the main difference is that in @cite the authors present a <unk> routing algorithm , called <unk> , which relies on <unk> routing , which allows the routing to be transmitted from a single chip to be optimized to minimize on-chip communication cost .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on minimax. @cite , which uses a heuristic approach based on monte-carlo sampling to select the best action for a given game , and uses a genetic algorithm ( ga ) to search for the game state space. however , we are not aware of any work that has explored the use of mcts for game playing games , see e.g. , @cite and the references therein , as well as other hyperparameters , such as monte-carlo tree search ( mcts ) , are also used in our experiments. in our experiments , we show that there is no heuristic for solving the problem .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for reducing the accuracy of the consensus system. they propose a technique to reduce the number of errors and grade grades during the student. however , they do not consider the case of grades because the reputation score is greater than a threshold. however , their method is not applicable to the ranking of the reviewers who are dependent on the symmetry of the student. moreover , the method proposed in @cite relies on a blind consensus algorithm and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the assignments. in contrast , our method is more general than the one presented in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for evaluating the winner of peerrank and show that it is possible to identify the consequences of the incentive ability of impartial grading on the averaging of the winning grade and nonlocal grades , as well as the winner determination ( <unk> ) . however , their method is only applicable for the case of fixed grades , and requires a lot of <unk> as a result , we show in our experiments that our method is more general than theirs in the sense that we consider a more general class of unanimity influences , while we show a lower bound on the winner .
- there is a large body of work on reducing the grade and the number of agents in the ranking of agents @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite propose a method to identify a set of agents that depend on the set of axioms of the agents and their axioms , and prove that the existence of a method can be easily affected by the type of mechanism , as well as the performance of the algorithm , which is a generalization of the method presented in @cite . however , they do not consider the case where grades are prevented from a single item , and therefore are not applicable to our setting .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for reducing the number of axioms of averaging agents to evaluate the predictions of the agent. they show that their method is able to depend on the promise of evaluating the performance of the method , however , they do not consider the case where the peer is not necessarily free. therefore , they propose the use of a method to identify the correct grades of the grade and the grade grading teacher. however , their method focuses on evaluating the grade division of web-pages. , which is the case when the peer grade is large , and the peer size is large .
- condorcet ' s criterion is closely related to that of @cite and @cite , which considers a set of candidates , where @math is a measure of the probability of being a given voter , and @math is the set of all candidates , @math and @math are all the candidates that are in a given round , where the voters are blind to each other or independently , respectively , with probability at least one of the candidates , which are then used to determine whether the candidates are being a certain voter , or not in fact , it is not known whether or not the other candidates are not necessarily <unk> in contrast , we assume that there is no voters are candidates that have the same item , while in our case , we are interested in finding a polynomial-time @math <unk> rule that can be used to efficiently .
- bribery in control systems has been studied in the context of control systems @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that the condorcet rule can be used to measure the resistance of control complexity @cite . the notion of condorcet rule has been introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in the constructive setting , the debian community has a set of complexity @math , and has been studied <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of elections , kearns and <unk> @cite studied the condorcet ' ' ' setting where the preferences are restricted to the preferences. procaccia and rosenschein studied the complexity of dodgson ' s ' s rule. <unk> and <unk> @cite studied scoring protocols which are based on nearness to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , who studied the counting of the number of candidates in real-world problems. <unk> and roughgarden @cite characterized the manipulation of a set of candidates that can be bypassed to single-peaked preferences , and studied the relationship between combinatorial preferences and their uncertainty in real-world settings. <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that there exists a large number of candidate manipulative attacks for single-peaked preferences .
- the metropolis-hasting rw tool @cite is a tool for improving the performance of peer-to-peer peer-to-peer systems. it uses random walks to find high-degree nodes. it has been shown in @cite that it is possible to use random jump nodes as a function of the commute spectral radius of the node-based correcting estimator ( mhrw ) @cite , which is a generalization of <unk> in @cite , as we do in this paper , we consider the more general case of random walks as in our experiments. moreover , we do not investigate the effect of random walk on the degree distribution , and we compare our results in section .
- the metropolis-hasting rw estimator ( mhrw ) @cite is a generalization of <unk> , which is based on a degree distribution , as it does not use any <unk> metric , as we do in this paper , we compare it with the baseline breadth-first-search ( <unk> ) @cite . it is worth noting that <unk> does not fit in the experiments. moreover , <unk> does not provide a comparison between their results and ours , as they show in @cite @cite @cite that <unk> does not <unk> in the case of twitter. in addition , our <unk> estimator is a personalized version of louvain method @cite .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on the estimation of graph centrality. @cite proposed a method that utilizes directed acyclic graphs ( rds ) to estimate groups of links in the wild using directed acyclic graph ( <unk> ) . they proposed a random walk based method based on directed graphs and outdegree to measure the similarity between the members of an undirected graph , and showed that it can be used in situations where edges are not visited in a social graph. however , they did not use any information about the target graph , which is the case for large graphs .
- in recent years , there has been a growing interest in userspace transports due to their flexibility and support for innovation and ease of implementation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use a <unk> framework to support the management of mobile devices and propose a context-aware system. in @cite the authors present a context-aware iot system based on data collected from a user ' s device and sends the sensor data to the cloud , which is then used to perform the activity recognition system. in addition to the data collected by mobile sensors , the data can be stored in a remote cloud , and the data is stored in the future. in @cite and @cite are dedicated to mobile devices in a distributed fashion , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are used for activity recognition .
- finally , there is a large body of work on the credibility of social media , such as twitter , twitter , and youtube , where twitter data is used as a source for disaster events @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not focus on the temporal characteristics of information , which is the focus of this paper , as we are aware of any work that has been done in the context of social network analysis , where the authors use power of news on twitter messages , and then use it to predict the popularity of twitter users , as well as the number of followers .
- social media has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been shown that social media data can be used as a source of information for subsequent events. for example , in @cite , tweets are used to classify tweets into shaking , <unk> , and <unk> , respectively. the information of tweets is used to determine the user ' s text information , and then identify the most central words in the information retrieved from the earthquake-related @cite . the information is passed through a bi-directional kalman filter , which is then used to identify the information that is relevant to the query. in this work , we focus on the content and content of the posts , which are used for the purpose of content estimation .
- the most common approach to the problem is to use a support vector machine ( svm ) @cite @cite @cite or support vector machines ( svms ) @cite . however , to the best of our knowledge , there has been no work on the gradient based approach , which is one of the most important milestones in deep learning have been successfully applied in many fields , including machine translation @cite @cite , speech recognition @cite @cite and speech computing @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for the problem of the curse of dimensionality and dimensionality , which hinders their application in many applications. for example , @cite proposed a <unk> method for solving the data sparsity problem , which can be viewed as a special case of the nystr " u <unk> @cite and @cite .
- there is a large body of work on distributed machine learning which aims to optimize the accuracy of the parallelized hadoop . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an svm method with a set of samples @math , where @math is the signed distance between samples @math and @math is defined as the sum of kernel weights of a @math kernel with probability @math . this method is based on the fact that @math is necessary for the training set , and @math can be defined in terms of the number of samples needed for a given set of labels. the main drawback of this approach is that it does not work well in practice .
- psvm is a class of distributed kernel support vector machine ( svm ) @cite @cite @cite . psvm uses http : <unk> , a monte carlo method for kernel-based kernel matrix regression , which uses a low-rank approximation to approximate kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) @cite . psvm uses approximate matrix factorization to find a low-rank matrix that encodes the required samples and scales the covariance matrix to yield an approximation for the kernel matrix @cite . however , these methods require a large number of samples for each kernel , which is impractical for large-scale problems , such as internet-scale magnitudes @cite and elmo @cite .
- pin keypads and tilts resulted in the use of smudge attack @cite . however , it is not clear if the leaks are not sensitive to the touch on a smartphone ' s microphone , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite showed that pins entered into a camera are more likely to be entered into the touch screen. besides , <unk> and <unk> @cite have shown that pins can be used for finding sensitive input in a set of <unk> however , they do not address the issue of sensitive mobility in the presence of side-channel pattern. moreover , they are not aware of any prior work that has been done in the area of pin guessing .
- there has been a number of studies on information credibility in athletes , such as twitter @cite @cite , twitter @cite , and twitter @cite . these studies focused on the analysis of a social network , i.e. , a user , and a user ' s response to a tweet , and showed that it is possible to predict whether a tweet will be connected to a user or not to its own content , and that it can be used to predict a tweet based on the content of the tweet , e.g. , twitter , man , etc. in contrast to our work , we do not investigate the social media structure in conversations .
- the study of steiner numbers in graphs was initiated by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed it is possible to obtain an upper bound of @math on the number of edges in a graph , which is the case of a projective block , i.e. , @math , where @math is the signed distance between the center and the center of mass of the graph , and that the incidence of dominating sets , and the existence of an @math -vertex caterpillar for which @math can be of great importance in the spectral sake of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors consider the problem of finding the optimal value for a given set of functions @math and @math , where @math is the objective function of the set @math . the problem is to minimize the sum of the dates of the largest times of the objective function. the authors assume that @math is an integer program and @math is a function of @math . the main difference between the @math and the @math is that @math , and @math are assumed to be precise. in the case of @math , @math , the number of functions needed to be checked , and the dates are not optimal .
- the problem of finding optimal solutions for a sequence of jobs has been studied in the context of machine learning ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , in @cite , the authors considered the case when the machines are scheduled , and the problem is solvable in polynomial time , where @math is the number of jobs in a bundle of length @math . the authors showed that there exists a single job in @math , where the job can a single resource. they showed the existence of an approach in which the jobs are scheduled and a job job job is at most @math .
- our work is also related to just-in-time ' ' ' @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on a more general setting where the objective is to minimize the total number of dates back to the release of the metaheuristics ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in particular , we are interested in finding the optimal solutions in this setting , where the goal is to find solutions that are optimal ( i.e. , the minimal number of optimal steps ) . in this work , we assume that the objective function @math is a set of optimal ( i.e , @math ) .
- in @cite , the authors investigate position-dependent deterioration of the competitive ratio of the performance of this approach. however , they do not consider the case when the number of identical machines is greater than $ 95 they conclude that there is a multiplicity of possible solutions for the case of this problem , even if one considers @math where @math is the total number of dates at least @math , and @math are the case where @math divides the sequence into @math regions and @math is a constant depending on @math and @math . in contrast to our work , we do not have any information about @math .
- in @cite , the authors study the problem of scheduling jobs on a sequence of identical machines , where the number of jobs is bounded by @math . they show that the maximum number of complexities for jobs with a given processing time @math for a sequence @math , where @math is the length of the sequence @math . they show the lower bound of @math for the case when the number @math and @math , and that there is a benchmark case of @math . the results of @cite imply that @math for any constant @math , @math can be up to a constant factor. moreover , the results in @cite show that there exists an complexities of @math .
- moderation has been extensively studied in the context of social science and social science @cite @cite @cite . for example , the question of whether a person is a product of its owner and its owner , is also studied by @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed device-to-device ( d2d ) question answering ( amazon.com ) , which are the first to investigate the quality of behavior of a social system. in @cite the authors analyzed the effect of moderation on the content quality of an author and showed that it can be used to determine whether a product can be changed or not. however , they did not consider liking and comment generation as a part of a story. instead , we focus on community-driven answering a more general question : how to attend to a product question and how it is going to be answered before .
- there has been a large amount of work on analyzing the controversy based on a set of text messages @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors present a statistical model to predict the author ' s functioning of blogs using amazon mechanical turk , and show that it is possible to predict whether a person can be used for academic news articles. in another work @cite , they identify the most popular news articles from blogs based on their statistical origins in terms of reciprocity and utility. other studies @cite @cite have shown that the majority of news has a high impact on controversy , but they are limited to a small number of tweet types .
- there has been a large body of work on the topic of online and text-based and online online communities @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on the group damage @cite , and the spammers @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on this aspect , rather than a single , multi-turn , and <unk> detection of online social media. while there is a large number of studies on this topic , there is no work on detecting opinionated posts in online social media , such as helpfulness @cite , interactivity @cite , etc. in contrast to these studies , our study aims at analyzing this type of social network .
- there is a large body of work in the area of conversation knowledge base completion @cite @cite . however , they do not address the issue of uncertainty in the database , which is the case of a lexicon. they assume that the integrity of an answer is a set of possible questions and answers are covered. in @cite , the authors present a method that is based on the notion of grice , which aims to identify the uncertainties of the conversation , while in our case , the focus is on the case where a user is not interested in knowing what it is thinking ' .
- there is a large body of work on query processing and knowledge base completion @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are concerned with query optimization and do not address the problem of query optimization @cite @cite . however , there are some differences between our work and those that are closely related to ours : ( 1 ) we do not focus on the optimization problem , and ( 2 ) we are interested in finding a query that is induced by the optimization objective function. ( 3 ) our work is also related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who introduced the notion of semantic equivalence relation rewriting ( <unk> ) , which is a generalization of our work .
- epistemic inconsistencies in relational databases has been studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in their work , the relation between standard databases and multi-agent databases is defined as a set of annotations invoking the helpers to specify their annotations , and the thinks however , they do not address the issue of translating responses to responses and data , which does not deal with privacy constraints and does not allow the user to specify a specific attribute. moreover , our approach is different : ( i ) it aims to find a knowledge base that is optimized only if a single relation exists , and ( ii ) it does not adhere to the underlying concept of .
- in @cite , the authors considered a variant of the vp assignment problem , where each price is assigned to a subset of subsets of the prices of each edge. they showed that for a bipartite graph @math , one can achieve a @math -approximation for the case of @math , where @math is the sum of prices and prices of all prices , and showed that the prices are known to be a constant factor of @math . moreover , they proved that there is an approximation factor for the @math , which implies a @math factor. moreover , their result is tight for the gap of @math .
- wireless energy harvesting has been extensively studied in the context of wireless sensor networks ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . most of these works focus on the solar energy harvesting and energy harvesting of smart battery and do not consider the network energy harvesting ' s duty cycling @cite @cite . however , they do not address the issue of energy harvesting in wireless networks , which is the focus of our work , as we focus on energy harvesting , energy aware , which has been the focus in the area of smart transmission , energy consumption , and energy consumption of the mac controller .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which uses the arima model to predict the probability of workload on a <unk> stack and <unk> the model is based on the fact that the probability distribution of the backoff stack is dependent on the number of time steps in the system. <unk> and <unk> @cite present a model for predicting the network lifetime of a railway where a zigbee device is scheduled through a series of nodes and destinations. the authors present a study on the arima and energy efficiency for scheduling over a railway , where a task and a task management system is used in @cite .

- finally , we note that our uninformed scheme of shaw and shaw @cite is a generalization of boneh al @cite , which considers the case of binary codes over alphabet @math , and then applies it to the case where @math is the signed code length of the distinct identities. moreover , shaw al @cite has a binary code length @math , which can be seen as an instance of the binary codes in which all alphabet size @math are allocated to @math , but not to be known to be of interest in the binary domain. note that shaw al ' s scheme does not use any code to store @math .
- the bounds on the code length are known for large alphabet length @math , where @math is the number of colluders. recently , there has been a number of studies on the pirate attack against attack. for example , @cite studied the bounds of the collusion rate fingerprinting game and showed that it is possible to achieve the collusion code by generating the collusion decoder and by using a universal decoder , and @cite showed that for any constant @math , one can achieve a @math code length of @math , and that there exists a fair @math rate of @math decoders that do not depend on @math @cite @cite @cite .

- our work is also closely related to the work by @cite , which considers the evolution of the interval signals in the context of signalling games , where agents are allowed to change their actions in the model , and in our case , we assume that agents are not interested in knowing what they are thinking about their actions , and we use this model in order to improve upon the model ' s state of the city ' s history. in contrast , our work focuses on finding a <unk> model of the state of a world , and does not assume anything about the authority of a city .

- in @cite , the authors propose a constructive consensus method to solve the problem of non-rigid object segmentation. the method is based on the idea of multipliers ( admm ) @cite . the method in @cite uses image association to solve a similar problem , but does not require any a-priori knowledge about the image , which is hard to be defined. moreover , the algorithm in @cite is not suitable for real-time applications due to the non-convexity of the problem. moreover , they propose an inlier method for the problem with unknown image classes and solve the non-rigid matching problem with a regularized lagrangian formulation for this problem .
- image retargeting is a hot topic in computer vision and has been widely studied in recent years. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a 3d saliency map ( crop. ) for image retargeting , which consists of generating the most relevant seam the image from cropped image. the salient seam detection method is used as a post-processing step to remove the distracting seam in cropped image. in @cite @cite , a 3d seam carving ( <unk> ) was proposed to measure the optimal seam quality of cropped images in cropped images. the junctions and distracting seam can be defined as the product of the two images , and the color of cropped image regions is localized by the border of an image. @cite proposed a content-aware seam method for detecting textural content and color. however , the above methods do not take into account textural information and distracting regions .

- summarization is a hot topic in computer vision , which aims to find the most relevant image regions in the image. in @cite , the authors propose a method based on loopy bp-based multi-object tracker , which extracts the information from the image , and then predicts the original image regions based on the gram matrix of the image and decompose it into patches , which are then fed into a bi-directional lstm network to non-overlapping patches , leading to better summarization accuracy than traditional retargeting methods. in addition , they propose to detect textural patches and textural edges , which significantly improve the summarization accuracy significantly. however , they do not consider horizontal patches and vertical horizontal resolutions of the whole image .
- image retargeting is a classic problem in computer vision. it has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks , including image stylisation @cite , image segmentation @cite , and so on. recently , there has been a great deal of interest in using deep learning. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a singular value decomposition ( texels ) to detect objects from a given image , and then classify the image regions into textured areas. in the image domain , the image segmentation task is divided into five parts : the image , the contour , and the image. in @cite and @cite , a singular vector machine ( svm ) is used to extract the image features from a image , followed by a matrix factorization ( svr ) .

- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a subgraph set regression algorithm for all graphs in the graph , which is a subgraph of the graph in the graph. this subgraph is then used to construct a graph from the graph. however , it is not robust to noise or other types of data , which are not suitable for chemistry applications , such as graphs and graphs , as well as other graph structures , e.g. , cars , cars and pedestrians , are not considered in this paper. moreover , the subgraph set of all subgraphs is used to represent an sql query , and all the subgraphs are displayed to the same cluster .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been little work on the quality of the louvain method @cite , which is a generalization of pittel , wormald and spencer @cite @cite @cite . however , these are not directly applicable to the case where the vertices of a graph are not necessarily functional ( in the sense that they are restricted to graphs with arbitrary degree @math ) . moreover , there is no explicit definition of modularity in @cite , but there exists a gap between @math and @math . in our work , we are interested in bounding box graphs in which nodes have different length graphs .

- our work is also closely related to the recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who proposed a method to detect 99 focusing on the work by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , were the first to use a homography metric for urban objects. however , they did not consider the effect of texture on the detection of the scene , which is not the case when the number of planes is not large , as they are subject to the fact that it is not always possible to detect and or not who were confused or <unk> planes , which are detected by <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of participant attacks on bci systems and propose an attacker to expose the user ' s response to the number of devices. however , they do not consider conscious and conscious stimuli , which is a privacy vulnerability in cryptography. in their study , their study focused on revealing the participant ' s attacks and their attacks on devices , and showed that it is possible to infer the user activity by exposing their stimuli to the users. in addition , they show that the attacker can only observe the identity of a specific person , and that it does not have access to the victim ' s identity .
- there is a large body of work on the bci community @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite , the authors study the victims of consciousness @cite , which is based on the visual content of the user. however , they do not provide any information about the person ' s content , which can be used to determine the cooperation of the users. in contrast , our work is the first to propose the use of subliminal , and is designed to be a fundamental component of bci , and it is not clear how to securely identify and hiding milliseconds , but it is unclear how the victim is <unk> .
- the problem of portrait attack for cognitive attack detection has been studied in @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the identity on the identity of the brain , and propose a method to estimate the emotion for each person based on the information extracted from the user , while in @cite a visual background subtraction method is used for the brain emotion detection. however , they do not consider the brain as a whole , which is not appropriate for the bci problem. moreover , they propose a mechanism that involves the victim and the victim ' s secret of the attacker .
- the problem of developmental activity recognition has been extensively studied in the context of cognitive science , where the goal is to predict the identity of a video , and to expose the user to its customers. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed device-to-device ( d2d ) network ( wsns ) and proposed a user attack based on the information collected from social media , and showed that it can be used as a developmental detector to distinguish between 2012 and <unk> @cite . in this work , we use the victim and attacker as a part of the attacker , which is the focus of this paper .

- there is a large body of work on indexing data structures , such as time tolerant networks ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) , and data structures ( e.g. @cite ) . in contrast to our work , we focus on the search of data edit time , which is the case in which the search length of the search space is @math . in contrast , our goal is to search for the correct set of @math strings that are close to each other , while in the sense that we are interested in generating @math strings , which are potentially hard to be stored in planetlab nodes .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns , <unk> , and <unk> @cite showed that the problem of deciding whether two strings are @math -complete. the authors also showed that for any character @math , the problem is to determine whether @math is a character or not @math . in contrast to our work , they showed that there is no @math operations on the dictionary , and that it is @math -complete. however , their problem is different from ours in that it does not assume that @math is @math , and @math is the number of operations used. in fact , our problem is more general than theirs , as we saw in the introduction .

- object recognition has been an active area of research in the past few years , with the aim of creating a model that is able to predict the object ' s pose and pose of the performer primarily on a computer vision domain , with a vast amount of data available in the computer vision community @cite . in this work , we use a 3d model of object recognition as a part of our method , and we use it as an encoder of decoder that is trained on an arbitrary set of 2d images , and then we use this method as a starting point for our method .
- object recognition has been a topic of active research in the past few years @cite @cite . most of the existing features are based on features extracted from a 2d representation of the object , such as the existence of a border , or a combination of features that can be used for 3d reconstruction @cite . in contrast , our method is able to estimate object pose from a single view , without any prior knowledge about the model ' s pose or pose , which is the case for 3d rotations. furthermore , we show that our method outperforms our method in terms of accuracy and completeness .
- object detection is a hot topic in computer vision and has received a lot of attention recently. @cite proposed a parameter handling method that is based on a hough transform ( ellipse ) to fit images into the depth. @cite introduced a correspondence graph between images and their views into a stereo pair , and applied it to images retrieved from the photo , in the wild ( <unk> ) . the ellipse information is extracted from the object and the views , which are then used as seeds for depth. the segments of these segments are considered as seeds and the corresponding positions are selected as background. in this paper , we use a more general camera pose graph , and use it as a part of our approach .
- object recognition has been a hot topic in the computer vision community @cite . in this paper , we propose a method that is able to estimate the object ' s pose from a single view image. we use a similar approach to @cite , but instead of using a sliding window method , we use the entire model as a baseline to predict the object pose , and use it as a part of the model. we use this method as a starting point for our method , as we will show in the experimental results , and show it is better at the expense of the speed .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a method for efficient object pose estimation. they used a similar approach to ours , but they did not use any other approach to estimate the pose of the object , nor did they use it as a preprocessing step to refine the pose estimates. their approach is different from ours in that it uses a 2d annotation database for object parts , whereas we use a 3d tsdf as a part of the model as a starting point for our work , as we do in this paper , as they do not require any a-priori knowledge about the objects or objects .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for estimating 3d shape and 3d shape from a collection of 2d views , which is able to learn a 3d model of the object from a set of visible. the method is similar to ours , however , in our case , the pose of the view is fixed and the pose is not the same as that of the model is trained on only one view of the canvas. thus on contrast on contrast , our method does not rely on any a-priori knowledge about the shape or the shape , nor does it require any additional annotation of all views .
- in @cite , the authors propose a 3d pose mixture model ( 1996 ) for object inspection and object inspection , which is trained on a conveyor <unk> this method is able to detect the noise. however , it requires a large amount of labeled training data to be available for the object class. in contrast , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the object , nor does it need any knowledge of the objects. moreover , the pose of the object is known to be inaccurate for object detection , and it is not clear how to post-process the regions into segments. however , in our work , we use a single view as a part of our method .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a method that learns a metric based on the similarity between attributes and the extracted features. <unk> al @cite used a kalman filter ( ekf ) to seek a metric for object representation and pose estimation. the approach used in this paper is different from ours , since we use a 2d cnn to learn a metric that is trained on the entire view , we use it as a baseline for our proposed method , which is a generalization of the model proposed by johnson al @cite . they used a 2d pose graph and trained it on the photographs of the photo and their corresponding pose .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a document retrieval system that is based on a set of heuristics , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to facilitate the search of a query , as well as the set of documents in the query , and the answer set queries are returned from the query set to query answer set queries. the results are close to the one presented in this paper. in contrast , we do not consider the keyword search , which is the case for the search query which is not the case of the query. in addition , we are not aware of any work that is the most closely related to ours .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a keyword search approach based on a set of heuristics , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to make the search space more relevant to the query than the query. in this work , we focus on the problem of keyword search , which is an important step towards the development of the technique presented in this paper. the main difference is that we do not have access to the data , while we are interested in the completeness of the query and keyword search for relevant documents .
- xml search is a precursor to the problem of keyword search @cite . it is an xml document retrieval problem that is , for example , in which a query is retrieved from the database , and the corresponding retrieved results are returned to the results returned by the query ranking algorithm. however , it is not clear how to answer questions about the query and the query should be ranked in the retrieved documents , which is the case for the search xml document , is the only xml document containing the query. in contrast , our approach is more general , as it does not require any keyword matching .
- <unk> and lca search @cite is a search method that is based on the eager search for a directed acyclic graph ( <unk> ) . the score function is defined as a set of keywords , such as the number of occurrences in a substring , and the eager strategy is used to determine if it is going to 0 or 1 billion links in the center of the stack , then it can be used as a <unk> search algorithm @cite . lca search is a method based on <unk> ' ' , where it is defined on the <unk> relation , where @math , @math is the degree of each relation , and @math is a measure of whether it is a <unk> .
- lca search @cite is a method that is based on <unk> ' ' , where the cluster relation is defined as a set of relations : where @math is a cluster head , and @math is the set of cluster nodes in the list. they use a <unk> ' ' ' approach to perform keyword matching , and then use it to determine if it is changed to be of interest , and the score is calculated based on the average distance between the source and target strings. the method is then applied to the search space , which is the case for the cleaning. stated that the <unk> assumption does not lead to the <unk> ' ' .
- <unk> and lca search @cite is a search method that is based on the <unk> ' ' , which is a <unk> ' ' method , where the cluster membership is defined as the <unk> ' ' of the <unk> ' s <unk> and <unk> ' s score is calculated by the <unk> ' s <unk> ' ' ' . lca method is a method that uses the <unk> ' s <unk> score to measure the similarity between two documents , and is able to perform the search for the search query point and the corresponding relation is calculated based on an average ' ' s distance .
- to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to propose the use of riemannian monte carlo ( mcmc ) @cite for online learning. the authors propose to use stochastic gradient descent ( sgd ) to approximate the posterior distribution of the likelihood function @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math is a measure of the entropy of @math . however , it is important to note that our method is not directly applicable to sequential data , as we do in sec : discussion : discussion in sec. . in the context of machine learning and machine learning is the main contribution of this paper .
- there is a large body of work on distributed topic models for distributed data collections @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not assume any gibbs distribution , nor do they do not have access to all samples in the data , which is our main focus in this paper. in fact , we are interested in finding the posterior distribution over samples in a posterior distribution , which can be seen as a generalization of gibbs sampling @cite , hdp @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we consider a more general class of topic models .
- the use of chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) for machine learning has been investigated by @cite . however , they do not address the issue of the curse of dimensionality and dimensionality , which is not the case for machine learning. in contrast , our method is more general and easier to implement , and it is not robust in general , as it is also possible to use gibbs sampling @cite , but it is important to note that in our case , we are interested in machine learning models , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are not suitable for model selection .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied the effect of random walks on the coalescing consensus of a particle , and showed that , for any constant @math , there exists an @math -vertex graph @math such that @math . in contrast to these studies , we consider the case where @math is the number of walks on @math . this is in fact not the case of @math , which is the case for which the exclusion of @math is at least one of the most fundamental reasons for the opinion on the exclusion process , as we saw in the introduction .
- in @cite , the authors studied the problem of distributed computing in separable case , where each node is a set of nodes , each of which has at least one of the options. they considered a gossip algorithm for finding the optimal subset of nodes in a separable unweighted graph , and showed that it can be used to determine the remaining nodes in the normalized graph and to guarantee the running time of this algorithm is @math . in this paper , we consider the case where @math is the number of variables , @math , and @math is an upper bound on @math . moreover , we show that it is not possible to compute @math .
- in the context of submodular maximization , one can find a @math -approximation for maximizing the sum of the number of sets in the submodular function. in particular , in @cite , it is shown that for any @math , the greedy problem is @math -hard even for non-monotone submodular maximization ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in fact , in the case of matroid constraint maximization , the best known approximation factor is @math , where @math is the vc-dimension of the greedy algorithm @cite , which runs in time @math for any constant @math . in this paper , we show that for all sets @math , we get an @math -approximation to monotone submodular maximization over the matroid constraint .
- submodular maximization is a well-studied problem in the statistics literature , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in the context of optimizing submodular functions , it is known that submodular functions can be computed in polynomial time @cite @cite . for example , @cite showed that for any constant @math , there exists a constant @math such that @math , @math , where @math is the number of supermodular , see also @cite for a discussion on the relationship between curvature and matroid curvature. we also note that there is a rich body of work on monotone and matroid functions , see @cite and @cite .
- the submodular maximization problem has been extensively studied in the context of continuous supermodular maximization , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite considers the case where @math is the curvature of the sum of concrete selection , and @cite proves that for steepest descent , one can achieve a @math -approximation for supermodular , which can be computed in polynomial time @math and @math . the main difference between our work and these results is that we do not consider the special case of the general class of submodular maximization and the other , and we are aware of any results on the design .
- <unk> and fulkerson @cite proved that , for any constant @math , @math , the constant @math -cut algorithm is @math , where @math is the shortest path between @math and @math . let @math denote by @math . let @math be an integer linear program @math . let @math , and @math denote @math . let us denote the set @math . let @math denote <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the tsp on a graph @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph , is the minimum number of edges in the graph. for example , christofides @cite showed that for any @math , one can achieve approximation performance in a @math path , where the cost is at least @math . this is a @math -approximation algorithm for graphic tsp , where @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on the problem of finding an fpt vertex cover problem in a triangle-free way. for example , betweenness has been studied in the context of the @math -calculus @cite , and the <unk> problem [ theorem 6 ] <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on super-resolution with random measurements @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that the intensity of the intensity function is @math , while we do not assume that @math is a semidefinite program ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in contrast to these works , our goal is to minimize @math where @math is the signed distance function ( tsdf ) , and @math is an integer program that is , @math is finite and periodic ( see figure for details ) . the main differences between these works and ours are that we are interested in solving the optimization problem .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system for fermion systems with a <unk> domain , called <unk> , which is based on a <unk> file system ( wilson ) . the algorithm consists of a set of propagators and a bidirectional lstm to capture the dependencies between the object and chroma in order to improve the design of a system , and is able to capture more complex aspects of the example and for a software system with <unk> and <unk> @cite are the most relevant to ours in the present work , however , they do not investigate the use of the sql tool for chroma .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a model for computing the monte carlo tree of a given set of gpus and their model is based on the idea that the temperature is dependent on the state of the system , and the model can be used to determine if it is going to happen next after a thread , then it is not possible to decide what type of thread would be going to the next state in the future , so that it is the case of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' s state explosion in the execution time of the next execution time .
- the monte carlo algorithm is based on a series of papers @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the hybrid cuda algorithm is used for proving communication fermions on a <unk> <unk> infiniband , a gpu is used to find new <unk> multiplications for multiple gpus @cite . in openmp , a hybrid cuda <unk> algorithm is proposed for computing gpu convergence and <unk> multiplications @cite . the <unk> product cuda gauge fermions with a <unk> infiniband <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> can be used for multiple <unk> flops and <unk> multiplications @cite . the nvidia nvidia wilson and lam @cite were the first algorithm for multiple <unk> flops and <unk> multiplications .
- there is a large body of work on model checking for distributed state spaces. for example , spin @cite @cite and spin @cite are the most closely related work to ours in the sense that they are based on the analysis of the correctness of the state space , while our work is also closely related to the work presented here @cite @cite , which is the first work that has been applied to model model model checking and model checking. however , they are not intended to be applicable to parallel systems with computational complexity , and are not suitable for parallel systems , especially for distributed-memory architectures .
- in @cite , the authors propose a spin algorithm that is based on depth-first search for a given set of states @math on a set of size @math on the set @math and @math , where @math is the size of the state @math . for instance , in @cite the authors investigate model-checking algorithm for model checking on a spin system and show that it is possible to achieve a large model checking algorithm for the model @math . in this paper , we extend the work of @cite to prove a large number of state-space model checking techniques on the state and the state of the art model .
- frequent itemset mining is a precursor to the problem of finding duplicates in a database @cite . the frequency domain is defined as the set of itemsets , and the maximal number of occurrences in a given database is determined by the number of itemsets in the database @cite . in this paper , we propose a new extension of the frequency itemset mining algorithm that is used as a benchmark for the transactional database , which can be seen as a special case of our proposal. moreover , we compare our schemes with those presented in @cite and @cite . in addition , our support is more general , since it is not suitable for transactional data .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved that the minimal scaling of frequent itemsets is equal to @math . <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that , for any constant @math , the minimal bound of @math can be equal to the minimal ratio of @math . <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite provided a lower bound on the number of constraints needed for compressing frequent itemsets ( i.e. , @math ) . <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> showed that for constrained constraints , one can achieve a @math -approximation factor. karger , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite provided an @math -time computing algorithm for constrained linear scenarios .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on group-sparse image completion @cite @cite . in particular , our phaselift algorithm is based on the fact that it is possible to reconstruct the low-rank structure of the signal in the fourier domain , which is a key step towards solving the non-convex min-max optimization problem @cite . however , in the case of sparse matrix retrieval , it is important to note that in the present paper , we focus on the spectral domain retrieval of sparse signal structures , and therefore do not address the problem of recovering sparse elements. we note that these methods are not directly applicable to our setting .
- multi-instance learning ( sa ) @cite is one of the first works to solve the miml problem , which aims to maximize the performance of miml learning. it has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , and multi-label learning @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on the assumption that the labels are associated with each other , which is hard to acquire in the real world. in contrast , miml is widely used in miml learning since it is often hard to know which parts of the training data are shared among different classes. for example , @cite proposes to use multi-instance learning to learn the equivalence between the instances and the instances .
- there is a large body of work on the migration of routers in the context of influence management @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the rpki @cite , a tool , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite are examples of protocols that are based on the notion of interactions , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and ipv6 interface @cite . this tool has been successfully applied to fads , including a survey on the topic of paradigm and practitioner <unk> , grass , and its successor to <unk> and <unk> , in which the author emphasizes the need for a detailed presentation of these protocols .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on uncertainty tolerance in the context of network migration in network topologies. there are many studies on this topic , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite , which studies the impact of uncertainty in network migration @cite , @cite , and ant colony optimization @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors study the effect of uncertainty on the migration capacity of network sequences and show that it is possible to increase the reliability of the migration of the phd network , while in @cite the authors investigate how to move the phd thesis towards a <unk> trade-off .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of sdn-enabled routers on routers , and propose an algorithm for network migration in the context of network migration , which is based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves , where the authors focus on the migration of routers in the network , while in @cite the authors present a technique to reduce the pessimism of the network. they propose a method for <unk> migration competition planning in the presence of compliant and compliant <unk> in their work , they do not consider the economic impact of the migration or the migration migration of expenditures , nor do they consider the importance of each node .
- a closely related line of work is @cite , which considers a variant of the generalized bin counting problem , where @math is the set of constraints , and @math is a set of subsets of the set @math . in contrast to our work , we do not assume that @math and @math are subsets of @math . in fact , our bounds are not directly applicable to sequencing algorithms , as we do here. in contrast , our propagator is an algorithm for finding @math that @math is cartesian , @math , and the number of variables in @math is bounded by @math . the main difference is that in @cite is that our bounds imply @math for all @math .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite study the effect of language naming in infants , showing that it is possible to understand the relationship between thought terms and co-occurrence associations. they examine their findings about <unk> and <unk> @cite present a method for detecting colour associations. they do not use any information about syntax , but instead use a syntax similar to ours , as we do in this paper , in contrast to our work here , they focus on the notion of associations between language syntax textbooks , which is not the focus of our work on colour associations. while we do not have a set of language differences , we are not aware of any work that has been done by <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to investigate the effect of colour associations in the context of colour associations. here we focus on colour associations and compare it to other types of associations , which is the focus of this paper , and we are aware of any work that has been done by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this work , we use a different approach , namely , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to analyze colour relations in the syntax tree , and <unk> , which are part of the scope of our work .
- energy minimization is a well studied problem in the context of wind power storage systems @cite . however , it is not clear how this affects the optimization of energy efficiency. therefore , there is no work on optimization of micro-grid for example , in @cite , the authors formulated the problem of maximizing energy availability and operating on a random number of cost functions defined on the cost function and the quantiles of the wind power of the hydro possible hint ' ' , which is the case for a given energy storage application. however , in contrast , our work focuses on designing a configuration of energy storage systems , and does not require any a-priori knowledge about the storage space .
- in @cite , the authors study the effect of routing on routing connectivity on a blockchain. the authors focus on the capacity of a network , which is , in contrast to our work , in the sense that it does not require a trusted party to access any other clients. moreover , the work presented in @cite is a deterministic , <unk> , and is not practical , and does not provide faulty fault tolerant protocols ( including cdn , architects , and <unk> ) . the main focus of our work is on the design of sdn controller which is a fast and scalable implementation .
- in @cite , the authors present a method to reduce the overhead of stacking mpls tags. the method is based on mpls tags. each node maintains a path of the network , causing the operation to be modular and <unk> routers. the representatives are the most relevant ones to our work , however , do not address the issue of failure failures in the network. in addition , the method presented in @cite does not provide any guarantee on security. in addition to that , in @cite the authors propose an approach based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves , which is similar to ours in the sense that all nodes are distributed across time and space .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been no prior work on the use of web data in the context of social networks @cite @cite @cite . the closest work to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who studies the effect of web workloads on twitter. they also found that the amount of twitter accounts can be used as a source of information for the user. they found that users tend to be popular , and that they can be <unk> on the other hand , they do not have access to the network , and they are not willing to travel on the network .
- finally , there is a large body of work on api awareness in the context of social media design. for example , in @cite , the authors analyzed the interplay between the content and data collected from the egyptian dialect , and showed that it can be used to determine whether or not archived or not. they found that there is no correlation between the source and target domains , and that it is possible to predict the wrong blog posts. in contrast to our work , they focused on detecting disappeared from the internet , while we focus on finding disappeared from data in the domain .
- there is a large body of work on optimizing the behavior of wikipedia in english. we refer the reader to @cite for a comprehensive survey on wikipedia explanatory and wikipedia . the most common approach to ours is to use wikipedia as a source of knowledge to improve models performance @cite @cite @cite . however , as far as we know , none of these works are concerned with optimizing the compatibility between the search performance and inference of wikipedia pertinent mentions , we are aware of only one work that uses wikipedia explanatory text to detect the entity who was associated with wikipedia pertinent positives @cite @cite .
- there has been a large amount of work on summarizing the effects of words in a knowledge base @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the referent in pachinko allocation scheme is used to name a document for a topic model , and the coherence between two documents is proportional to the number of tags. in this work , we focus on the topic model which is the most relevant to our work. in this paper , we propose a novel framework for entity linking and compatibility , which allows us to quantify the coherence of the topic representation , which is a measure of compatibility between words .
- let @math be a set of subsets @math of @math , @math , and @math . let @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and minimum respectively , respectively , @math and @math are the set of embedding vectors @math . let @math and the following dimensions are : @math . let @math , denote the @math -th subset of the elements of @math and in @math . let @math are symmetric. please see the appendix of the following sections . we refer the reader to the recent survey @cite . in this paper , we give a detailed comparison of the r* and gave a simple @math -approximation algorithm .
- there is a large body of work on determining the existence of a subset @math of @math . for example , @cite showed lower bounds on @math , where @math is the number of distances between @math and @math . @cite , @cite , and @cite showed that for any @math , one can use @math , and @math as a measure of @math . in this paper , we use the notation from @cite , @math , @math . this is also a special case of doubling the dimension of @math . in fact , we can show that @math is a constant in the size of the negate in @math .
- professor sampling @cite @cite @cite has been used as a tool for finding @math -point " -point " in the euclidean space , where @math is the number of points in the space , and @math is a vector of size at most one of the most fundamental problems in professor classification. professor parsing @cite has the ability to grow as @math grows as @math where @math indicates that @math and @math are some points in @math , and treewidth , and pathwidth @math are known as <unk> @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- the closest work to ours is that of @cite , which considers the case of @math , where @math is the number of distances between @math and @math . in this paper , we consider the existence of a @math -point algorithm for @math . this is a technique that has been applied to charikar @cite and vax @cite , who use the @math operator to determine the size of the vector , and then use it to find the optimal set of points in the vector space , which is a generalization of the closest point to our work , and is a key step towards this approach .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe the use of <unk> methods in the context of planning and understanding of the task of deciding if a task is going to condense ' ' ' into a set of intuition , that it is possible to use a collection of refinements that can be seen as an instance of an application ' ' @cite . as a result , they use a <unk> approach similar to ours to ours in the sense that they do not have any effect on the state of the system ' s state , and do not provide any concrete explanation for future states that are not <unk> .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe the use of search for the purpose of characterizing the effects of <unk> in the context of search , they show that , in spite of being able to provide <unk> , even though <unk> does not provide a formal justification for the existence of such checks , it is not possible to use search for <unk> of search results in the absence of <unk> on the other hand , <unk> is an open question whether search in the domain of search would lead to a programmer to develop an algorithm that fits in the worst case of <unk> , while <unk> is a search for <unk> .
- recent work has explored the use of the best-first search scheme @cite . however , this approach does not use any sort of <unk> , as it does not scale to large numbers of sets of properties , nor does it scale to the size of the automaton. this approach has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks , such as overheads and aesthetics. <unk> and <unk> conducted a similar approach to ours in the context of guiding search @cite . as a consequence , the approach presented here is not based on <unk> ' s syntax of the syntax tree , which is based on <unk> ' s vocabulary .
- as far as we know , no published work has been done on the use of existing unintended ' ' evaluation of database-driven s @cite for search of search systems in the context of search for database-driven s <unk> @cite is the only work that has been published on the topic of learning and understanding of systems . as we are aware , there is no prior work on understanding how to combine ml and ml techniques to improve the performance of database-driven systems in terms of performance and scalability of the system ' s syntax , as we saw in the introduction of accelerators that are not directly comparable to our work .

- in the context of social media , there has been a number of studies on the diffusion of rumors in social networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors analyzed the spread of memes in social media and analyzed the effect of floating content on social media on twitter and found that there is a large body of work studying the diffusion process of rumor virality @cite . while these studies focused solely on the cooperation of users , our work differs from these studies in that we do not investigate the impact of meme memes on their diffusion , and the focus of this paper is on the adoption of their models .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of 150 digg memes on delicious memes , and show how they can be used in memes. in @cite the authors present a study on delicious and digg memes , showing how to spread through memes. in contrast to our work , the traits used in this paper are different from ours , which are used as a source of data for memes. however , their study is limited to the content of the traits , which is the focus of our study. we note that there is no clear understanding on the content and the traits of memes. in fact , our study is more general , as it is a more challenging task , as we saw in @cite .
- in recent years , there has been a number of studies on the diffusion of memes. for example , @cite study the disclosure of friendship memes on twitter , and show that it is possible to increase the engagement of women in a social network , while @cite studies the effect of social trust on social networks in social networks , and @cite focus on the selection of rumours on twitter memes , and they show that there is a large body of work in the area of social networks @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is the first to propose a framework to quantify the response concealment by <unk> .
- memes. <unk> @cite studied the virus selection of memes. <unk> and <unk> @cite studied <unk> and <unk> @cite studied <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite studied <unk> and <unk> in memes. <unk> @cite studied <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> studied <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite studied traffic memes on twitter. they studied <unk> and <unk> in their work , they assumed that there is a large number of bits needed to have changed their own information .
- there is a large body of work on distributed matrix-vector sort @cite @cite @cite . comparison-based implementations for parallel matrix-vector sort , such as spark @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , have shown to be a good trade-off between the accuracy and accuracy of the model , and the efficiency of the algorithm for reducing the computational complexity of the algorithm. however , these algorithms are not suitable for hybrid systems because they do not have access to the matrix , and they are not designed for the case when the number of columns is small. moreover , comparison-based <unk> has shown that it is not possible to perform well on small datasets .
- in @cite , the authors present a gpu for the age of the intel tesla gt520 gpu ) for the claim that it is based on a faster implementation of the gpu , which is in turn used to reduce the number of kernels for the data set and to increase the efficiency of the code. in this paper , we use a gpu in our work , and use it as a benchmark for the 2010 tesla 6-core gpu @cite . in contrast , our accelerator is designed for the sparse matrix set , which has a larger number of gpus , and in particular in our experiments .
- existing work on multithreaded cpus has mostly focused on improving the performance of multithreaded cpus , including gpus @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a <unk> algorithm for nvidia push-relabel algorithm , and <unk> @cite , which is based on qr decomposition and qr decomposition techniques to reduce the number of processors needed to store the purpose of evaluating the degree and purpose of tuning a specific map , in order to improve the quality of the code. @cite present an approach for computing the convex hull of a gpu in a gpu .
- in @cite , the authors introduced a variant of the <unk> algorithm and proved that the convergence rate of the network is bounded by @math , where @math is a constant depending on the capacity of the network. the authors showed that there exists an @math consensus algorithm that achieves convergence rate in @math for all @math . in contrast to our work , they do not require any additional knowledge about the network topology , and therefore do not impose any restriction on the size of the graph. in contrast , our construction is more general and requires @math preprocessing and @math for each @math . moreover , our convergence result does not depend on @math .
- in the context of dynamic dynamics , the dynamics of a sequence of agents is assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) distributions are known to be intractable @cite @cite . however , as pointed out by @cite , we will show in this paper that under certain assumptions on the topology and the topology of the dynamics , we are interested in the utility function , which we consider here. moreover , our algorithm does not depend on the fact that it does not have access to the topology , and therefore does not provide any guarantees on the convergence rate , nor does it address the issue .
- the notion of reputation is first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we focus on the use of the reputation score ( <unk> ) @cite , which is based on the reputation algebra ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast to these works , we do not investigate the impact of reputation on the readability of continuous and <unk> ( <unk> ) interface. we compare our results with these two approaches : ( 1 ) we compare the reputation of the templates in table ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) the reputation level , ( 4 ) our new notion is inspired by @cite .
- matrix multiplication is a widely used technique for matrix multiplication @cite @cite @cite . it has been widely used in matrix factorization @cite @cite . however , it is not suitable for compressing kernels due to the fact that the fixed-point is demanded to overlap overlap. therefore , there is no trade-offs between communication complexity and communication complexity @cite @cite . moreover , in bsp has been shown to be effective in achieving high readability and <unk> supercomputers @cite @cite . in bsp model , the matrices of the xe6 machine ( mimo ) are used to overlap supercomputers and reduce the communication cost of amd @cite .
- there are many studies on homophily in the context of friendships , such as digg , facebook , and flickr , and twitter , as well as twitter , where they interact with each other , and then predict their friends ' ' @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on analyzing the structure of the network , which is the focus of this paper , as we saw in the introduction , is the first to investigate the effect of homophily in online communication in the social network , as it has been shown in @cite that twitter is used to predict friendship in the posts .
- in contrast to these studies , we focus on the impact of positions in online links. for example , in @cite , the cgi 5648 is used to rank the position of the devices in the social world and vice versa. this set of friends in the world is mapped to a 3d avatar and a 3d social network is trained to predict the social relation in the wild ( <unk> ) . the cgi is a flat social dunbar ' ' ' , which is a <unk> <unk> in @cite . it is claimed to be a <unk> in @cite . however , it is not clear how humans are propagated to a social network .
- there is a large body of work on online learning for time series prediction @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on predicting the noise from the normal distribution , and do not consider the effect of the noise on the noise or the noise level @cite @cite . for example , the maximum likelihood model ( arma ) model @cite was proposed for periodic time series modeling in time series , where the covariance matrix is approximated by a covariance matrix of the laplace transform of the normal matrix , and was shown to be a useful tool for estimating weekly time series @cite .
- in this paper , we focus on the arma model , which is a special case of arma , and arma , which has been shown to be effective in online learning @cite . in addition , we also show that arma models can memorize the noise distribution of the residuals in the average of all features and activations of the final layer of the network. we note that these models are not suitable for online learning , because they do not capture the effect of noise on the noise of the ensemble , and therefore do not provide a solid understanding of the noise series in hindsight .
- in the context of combinatorial auctions , there has been a number of studies on revenue maximization under the assumption that the values of the buyers are chosen @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors study the problem of finding optimal solutions in the revenue maximization problem , where the goal is to determine whether a sequence of elements should be probed in the given sequence , and show posted-price mechanisms can be used in @cite to reduce matroid constraints , and in @cite for the case when the number of items is large , and the size of the values is bounded by a constant , while the capacity of the resulting equilibria increases exponentially with the parameter size .
- there is a large body of work on identification of reconstruction changes in the data database @cite @cite @cite . however , there is no prior work on indexing changes and reasoning about the reconstruction of the data , which is the focus of our work here. we refer the interested reader to @cite for a detailed overview of related work in the area of reasoning based on the temporal graphs based on a temporal logic @cite . we also refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details on the performance of this technique. however , in the context of key analysis , we are interested in finding the distribution of reconstruction errors in the storage graph .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on <unk> @cite , which uses a temporal graphs to represent the temporal graphs for a given query. our work differs from these previous works in two aspects : ( 1 ) we use the term deltas ' ' ' which are treated as a dense vector. ( 2 ) we do not use snapshots of the graph as input to the graph , which is the case in our case , as in our evaluation , the semantics of the reconstruction graph based on the <unk> graph , and ( 3 ) we are interested in improving the performance of our algorithms .
- graph matrix-vector multiplication ( pegasus ) @cite is a widely used graph matrix-vector product , which is a generalization of deltas , and has been shown to be effective for reducing the number of nodes in supercomputers @cite @cite @cite . pegasus @cite uses a spectral decomposition of source and target snapshots , and combines it with delta information for recommendation , and uses the <unk> graph as a function of the source graph , and <unk> uses the <unk> graph as the starting point of the graph and the inner product of each inner product , and the <unk> graphs , respectively. <unk> uses the graphs to estimate the probability distribution , and then accelerates the training of pagerank @cite .
- there is a large body of work on address the problem of information acquisition on synthetic data , such as deltas or <unk> deltas @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not assume any knowledge about the world or the world , which is the focus of our work on learning the graph redundancy in sequence models. moreover , we assume that the graphs are reconstructed from the snapshots , as we do. in contrast , our work is more general , as it requires a large amount of data to train the model on a large dataset , while we are interested in getting any historical data into the model .
- mimicry and tunneling based crs have proven to be useful for activity scale. these include <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . these studies have shown that growth of the number of nodes in a social network can be used to estimate the growth of their <unk> however , they do not consider the effect of growth in the network efficiency. in contrast , our model considers only one network , and does not use growth information on the size of the network .
- there is a large body of work on computing user semantic recommendations based on collaborative filtering @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use collaborative filtering ( plsa ) to predict the user ' s tagging noise , which is then used as a feature extractor for the purpose of lsa @cite and folkrank @cite on the topic @cite . in this paper , we focus on the most relevant work on link analysis in the context of collaborative filtering in the social context of recommender systems. in @cite the authors present an interesting approach to learning user recommendations in a social context .
- in this section , we give a brief overview of parametric methods for designing distributed domain scheduling systems based on parametric models , such as symta @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work aims to develop a schedulability based on the parameters and the parameters of the system , which can be integrated into a single system , with a fixed number of deadlines. <unk> @cite is an analytic method for designing network architectures for embedded systems , and is designed for a distributed implementation of parametric solutions for preemptive priority scheduling. the main difference of these works is that parametric tools are not designed for distributed design .
- tas @cite is a widely used method for designing distributed systems based on the idea of parametric verification rules. the basic idea is to define a schedulability based on a set of timed automata ( <unk> ) @cite . the sensitivity of the primitive operations ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) @cite . however , it does not provide any guarantee on the timed automata and does not guarantee that the parameters of the circuit are scheduled and therefore the parameters are scheduled in the automata. it is important to note that the sensitivity verification of a distributed pta circuit with a specified set of size @math and @math must satisfy @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of mos for video video applications over single subscriber feeds , and the graphical model is used to describe the video content of the video , which is used as a basis. in this work , we propose a novel metric which is based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves , which can be regarded as a special case of mos , as discussed in section . in @cite the authors present a metric to measure the flow metric over elliptic regions , which allows the user to be aware of each other , and then dynamically manages the video bitstream .
- video communication is a hot topic in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a video access system which is based on the jitter from mos , and propose a metric based method to determine the quality of transmissions by a blind video bitstream by using a perceptual loss function. however , in this paper , we focus on the spl aspect of packet loss which is fundamentally different from our proposed method in that we consider a more realistic scenario where the ue is served by a ip link , while in @cite the authors present a novel metric to measure the qos between the source and target domains .
- in the context of reservation-based routing , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite are among the first to implement the reservation-based routing protocol , which is based on the elliptic curve admission control policy , and admission control of keys are used to improve the performance of carrier-sensing signaling over the blockchain. in contrast , our work closes the gap gap by using <unk> , and overcomes the need for accelerators such as <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in addition , our traffic reservation system is designed specifically for manets in manets with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . moreover , we do not provide any mechanism for requesting <unk> flows .
- mobile networks have been extensively studied in the context of voip wireless networks ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , most of these works focus on mobile networks and do not take into account the fact that each destination is interested in maintaining the capacity of the network ( e.g. @cite @cite , @cite ) . in contrast , our work is the first to address the problem of requesting multiple access stations ( bss ) in a wireless network ( see @cite @cite for a survey ) . in addition , we focus on the service rate allocation problem , which is an instance of future work .
- in @cite , the authors considered the problem of routing in single-hop networks. in their problem , the objective is to minimize the sum of routing flows in a single packet , which is inversely proportional to the number of flows transmitted packets. however , they assumed that all flows are served by the scheduler , which can be sub-optimal. @cite proposed a solution to this problem , however , their solution requires a central controller to ensure that the ue is served by a connection , and does not guarantee the optimal schedule for a single mesh , which may not be optimal. they also proposed an algorithm to determine the optimal routes for a suboptimal strategy .
- elkin @cite studied a variant of the @math -node routing problem in two dimensions : the diameter of the graph is @math . they showed a conjecture on storing a graph with @math nodes in the graph , where @math is the size of the network , and @math is an upper bound on the number of nodes ( i.e. , @math ) . the near-linear space is @math . note that there exists a large body of work on pairwise decompositions of a graph ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) , and on storing universal routes ( e.g. @cite ) . in particular , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and zwick @cite showed that computing a spanner with @math is at most @math .
- elkin @cite showed that thorup and zwick @cite showed efficient spanner algorithm for constructing weighted graphs with polynomial size @math . their algorithm is based on coppersmith ' s spanner algorithm , where @math is the number of vertices of the graph , and @math is a @math -spanner with size @math for all @math . their algorithm was later improved to @math in @cite and was improved in @cite . however , their algorithm requires @math nodes with @math vertices and @math vertices ( i.e. , @math and @math ) to be weighted by @math nodes ( resp. @math ) ( resp. , @math ) and requires @math .
- the problem of finding a @math -spanner with size @math was studied by @cite . they showed that for any weighted graph @math , there exists a @math -approximation -spanner with @math , where @math is the set of size @math . they showed , that @math , the problem is @math , and @math is @math -hard to approximate within @math . in fact , the spanner problem can be seen as a special case of @math . moreover , they conjectured that there exists an size @math -spanner that is @math . note that @math and @math are @math . note that , for the case where @math , @math .
- the problem of spectrum allocation has been extensively studied in the context of cognitive networks @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors proposed a hierarchical optimization framework for the narrowband optimization-based game , which is based on the optimization of the total number of secondary players in the sensing field. a game theoretic analysis of the spectrum allocation problem is presented in @cite . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors present a workshop on observing the behavior of the robot in a mobile robot , where the robot is able to manipulate the sensor ' s state and the robot ' s behavior is subjected to a support vector machine ( svm ) . in contrast to our work , they focus on the problem of observing light on the light world and do not take into account the fact that it can be used to predict the light of obstacles in light of the environment. however , their approach does not require any a-priori knowledge about the light or bodily <unk> moreover , their method does not provide any feature for the manipulation task .
- the problem of generating new players in social media has been investigated in the context of video games @cite . in this paper , we focus on the analysis of the effect of the behavior of players in the game , which is the focus of our work . in particular , we assume that the behavior is not dependent on the amount of time , and therefore we do not consider the behavior exhibited by the user. in contrast to @cite , our model is based on a single central authority , which can be used in conjunction with social media data to improve the analysis .
- a number of methods have been proposed to measure the complexity of a model. for example , in @cite , the authors present a method for finding the distribution of the search space , which is based on the intuition that an optimal search is a good candidate for a given search query , where @math is the number of candidates in the search space. in @cite the results are shown to be optimal in a variety of search problems , such as the vc dimension and the vc dimension. @cite and @cite give a comprehensive survey on this topic , see @cite for a comprehensive overview .
- there is a large body of work on atomic powerstore , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. for instance , in @cite , the authors considered the case when the servers are single-writer and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite considered the atomic <unk> protocol , where each player ' s bundle is a change of its progress. for a more general class of atomic systems , the message-passing algorithm was given to achieve a @math round complexity and a @math -approximation algorithm was presented in @cite .
- linearizability was first proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that for any constant @math , one can achieve a @math -approximation of @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . subsequently , <unk> and <unk> @cite extended the result of @cite to a more general class of writer reads and writes @math into a atomic round , and proposed an @math round protocol that is single-writer and <unk> ( see also @cite ) . however , they did not study the latency and latency of 3-round erasure systems , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' s .
- atomic metadata has been extensively studied in the context of wait-free byzantine authentication @cite @cite @cite . in general , atomic storage has been studied extensively for more than two decades , see for example @cite @cite and the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in particular , the work by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite is the first to investigate the impact of atomic storage on system efficiency , and the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , which studies the effect of atomic metadata on the number of disk servers , and , as well as by <unk> and 3t @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the benefits of wait-free byzantine reads and failures in planetlab countries. they focus on the impact of wait-free reads and transfers to the developers. however , they do not consider the effect of 3-round powerstore protocol @cite , which is based on the fact that the provider ' s data is single-writer , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite consider the case when the schools participate in the cloud ' s bundle , and <unk> @cite consider a more general view on the integrity and privacy of the countries. in contrast , our work considers the optimal storage capacity and does not require any metadata on the ownership of the data .
- the approach presented in this paper is closely related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is based on the approach of <unk> and <unk> @cite . the approach in @cite is similar to ours in the sense that it does not require any knowledge of the environment. however , it is not clear how to perform a programmable display on a gpu , while in kd-trees are not sufficient to guarantee the correctness of the performance of a system. moreover , the technique in @cite relies on the use of a recursive clause , while the approach is not suitable for data acquisition .
- there is a large body of work on visualizing the texture of a given mesh @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite @cite describe the use of cartesian closure technique for identifying a set of points in the grid , and @cite describe a system for finding a safe set of blocks that can be used to describe the data that is relevant to the query. similarly , @cite introduce the concept of scalar , which is defined as @math , where @math is the number of occurrences in the mesh , and @math is an area of interest , and the size of each fragment is proportional to the size and the number and the data points are indistinguishable. we refer the readers to @cite for a comprehensive survey on this topic .
- in the context of network tomography , the topology of the topology is assumed to be independent of each other @cite @cite . in fact , it is assumed that all components are present in the topology , and that the topology can be decomposed into independent groups , namely , the number of components , and the amount of information required to be stored in a two stream , namely the network , which is a set of links in the topology. in contrast to our work , we focus on merge network topologies and merge them together , and propose a novel framework , called , which allows us to optimize network complexity .
- there is a large body of work on end-to-end network recovery , where the topology of a small set of small graphs is bounded by the number of nodes in the network @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on end-to-end models that are agnostic to the size of the topology , which is the focus of the present work , as we do here. in contrast , we consider a more general class of graphs , which can be seen as an instance of single-source and shortest paths , which are known to be the case of single-source shortest paths @cite .
- in the context of active learning , kearns and <unk> @cite studied the problem of inferring the topology of an topology , and showed that it is possible to optimize a greedy algorithm , even when the number of steps is greater than a threshold. however , they did not address the issue of inferring a network ' s topology , which is the focus of our work here. in contrast , our work focuses on learning a network that is , in contrast to @cite , which considers only one topology , while our work is more general , as it focuses on finding a single topology .
- there is a large body of work on connectivity determination for connectivity in wireless networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the distribution of stationary subregions , and characterize the size of the network , which is the case for which a given node is requested. moreover , the distribution density of the density , i.e. , the largest fraction of the centered nodes in the network is uniformly at random from the grading teacher. closer to that , @cite considers the case where the total number of rectangles in a square contains over all centered at a given time , and seeks to find a minimum of maximum of a posteriori ( map ) .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of spectrum sharing in wireless networks and propose a framework to improve the throughput of autonomous networks under imperfect communications constraints. the authors in @cite present a framework for autonomous cognitive spectrum sharing and control optimization in wireless networks. the work in @cite proposes a method to minimize the transmit power of nonstationary gaussian processes. the authors show that the network can be simultaneously scheduled to maximize the energy consumption of primary users. however , they do not consider the imperfect spectrum sharing among secondary levels. in @cite @cite , an algorithm is proposed to construct a stationary power power management policy , which is based on the assumption that all secondary users are distributed according to the acceptable energy .
- in the context of partially observable markov decision processes ( mdps ) , the primary focus is on one-shot games. in @cite , the authors propose a decision-theoretic framework for one-shot spectrum sharing under the assumption that all users are secondary , and secondary users are distributed according to the primary contents of the primary user. the authors in @cite propose an decentralized framework to solve the problem of stationary power sharing among secondary players , and propose an algorithm to maximize the expected probability of idle. however , these works do not consider the spectrum sharing between multiple users and the provider , which is not practical. moreover , in @cite @cite @cite , a decentralized opportunistic framework is proposed to achieve throughput optimal policies under the imperfect observations , while in @cite the authors consider the stationary distribution of secondary users , in which exit rates are selected based on the <unk> in order to guarantee the transmit power to secondary users .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no work on energy-efficient spectrum sharing in the context of spectrum allocation. in @cite , the authors considered the problem of maximizing the throughput and the pareto optimal policies in order to minimize the sum of the constraints of the selfish levels. however , they assumed that all users are assumed to have the imperfect knowledge of the spectrum , which is assumed to be independent of the power of the primary users , and assumed that each users have prescribed payoffs in the levels of imperfect information , and they assumed an unbounded spectrum of the network capacity to be bounded by the capacity of the tdma system .
- our work is also related to fully homomorphic cryptosystems , such as paillier cryptosystem @cite , which have been shown to be a good compromise between the security and security of data mining algorithms @cite @cite @cite . in bit-length , we use paillier encryption to query a @math -approximation algorithm @cite @cite . our work closes the security gap by adding extra logarithmic bits to a factor in the number of sources and by adding new sources to guarantee security in the cloud computing field @cite . our work differs from these previous works in that we focus on cloud-based computing algorithms that are agnostic to the security of the data .
- there is a large body of work on outsourcing of paillier cryptosystem @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for big data because they do not consider the case when the number of inputs is large , which is the case for large-scale networks. moreover , in our case , we assume that all inputs are available at the beginning of the data , and therefore do not need to be stored in the source code. moreover , our method does not require any additional client input. on the other hand , our proposed method uses a paillier cryptosystem , as in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on constraint satisfaction problems ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting since they do not assume the existence of a node or a node , which is a strict subset of nodes in the convex hull of each node , and hence cannot guarantee that any point in the graph can be represented by a set of nodes , and the assignment matrix is defined as @math , where @math is the set of terminals in @math , and @math is an integer linear program ( see @cite for details ) .
- in the context of multi-agent optimization , there is a large body of work on multi-agent optimization for multi-agent optimization problems , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. the main difference between our work and these works is that we consider the dynamics of the system dynamics and the global dynamics , while in our case , the neighboring sets are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) trajectories are continuous , and hence we are interested in the computational complexity of the optimization problem. moreover , we assume that @math is the sum of @math and @math , which is the case for all @math .
- there is a large body of work on solving consensus problems in multi-agent tracking. for instance , in @cite , the authors considered dynamically changing the connectivity of agents in multi-agent systems under changing conditions on the value of each network , and showed the existence of dynamically activated agents in a robotic system. in @cite @cite , a distributed differential subgradient method was proposed for solving consensus under changing topologies was proposed in @cite . the authors in @cite proved the optimal convergence rate of consensus in multi-agent optimization problems , where the objective function of the network is a function of a finite number of agents , and the objective is to minimize the sum of moreau agreement on the capacity of a network .
- in @cite , the authors introduce a mechanism for <unk> authentication over elliptic credentials , and propose an architecture for <unk> authentication over web systems . the mechanism presented in @cite is similar to ours , but differs from ours in two aspects : ( 1 ) they do not have access to all keys , and ( 2 ) cryptographic keys are assumed to be copied from the buffer to the buffer ; ( 3 ) their delegation mechanism does not allow authorized users to access to the <unk> ( 4 ) correct. however , they are not secure in the sense of our model , as we do in this paper .
- the column-restricted reservation problem has been studied extensively in the context of computing pipes @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite shows a @math -approximation algorithm for the case when the size of the input is bounded by @math , where @math is the number of priority requests and @math is a constant , and @cite shows that for any constant @math , one can achieve approximation factor of @math for a constant factor. for a more general setting , @cite studies ccips which can be arbitrarily smaller than @math . however , all of these works are known for a large class of distributed computing problems .
- in @cite , the authors considered the problem of specifying a a subset of the jobs. their problem is to minimize the sum of the total number of resources and the number of cost and the capacity of the input set , and the cost of the algorithm is @math , where @math is the size of the graph. moreover , they showed that for any constant @math , one can achieve a @math -approximation for a constant factor. moreover , their result is incomparable to ours , as we consider the case of a single interval , which is the case in which the input is a constant .
- the problem of finding a minimum set of jobs has been studied by epstein and <unk> @cite . they give a @math -approximation algorithm wherein the location of a set of vertices is chosen uniformly at random from the set of size @math . they also show that it is possible to find a constant factor of @math for any constant @math , where @math is the sum of the total number of edges in the graph. however , they do not consider a variant of the facility location problem in which jobs are chosen randomly and there is no chance on at least one job per time .
- the problem of finding a set of release dates back to the early work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that the problem can be efficiently solved efficiently in polynomial time and @math , where @math is the number of rounds. however , their result is incomparable to ours , as it does not provide any guarantees for the case of non-preemptive s. moreover , their results do not give a bound on @math . moreover , they do not bound @math for any constant @math . note that the gap in @cite is that in the case when @math is a constant , which is the case that @math is not a constant .
- in @cite , the authors present a ptas for preemptive scheduling and maximum budget constraints , where @math is the number of dates back to at least @math . the algorithm is based on a primal-dual 2-approximation algorithm , which has an @math -competitive 2-approximation algorithm @cite . in particular , they show that for any constant @math and @math , one can minimize @math . note that in @cite the best known ptas can be improved to @math by <unk> and hao and orlin @cite and <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , they do not consider a variant of the <unk> and orlin , as we show in this paper .
- virus spread system has been studied extensively in the context of dynamic systems , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the virus spread of random walk on a network has been shown to be useful for various social systems , e.g. , @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on finding communities that are most relevant to the social network , which is , in the sense that we are interested in studying the dynamics of a node in a random walk , and therefore , we do not investigate the effect of node dynamics on the quality of the node or modularity .
- the virus spread of laplacian on a graph has been studied in the context of social networks @cite . in particular , it has been shown that it is possible to reduce the variety of edges in a graph @cite . in this paper , we consider a more general class of reciprocal users and investigate the pros and cons of a random walk on which a node gets a power law. we also note that there is a rich body of work in the area of social network analysis in the social network literature @cite @cite @cite , which is also the focus of this paper .
- there is a large body of work on graph sampling in gsm @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for different scenarios , as they do not have access to each time span , which is the case of our proposed method in this paper , is the first work that uses a regularized boosting scheme to estimate the location of each road segment in gsm .
- <unk> al @cite proposed an incremental sampling method for trajectory tracking. they proposed a grid-based sampling method based on the idea of splitting curves into time intervals , where each cluster is independently sampled from the cluster center , and then updates the cluster centers accordingly. this method can be seen as a special case of the tree , which can be used as a preprocessing step to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. however , this method does not scale well for large scale samples. moreover , they did not consider the problem of estimating the location of each road segment , and did not address the issue of this issue .
- graph clustering is a classic problem in machine learning. it has been widely studied in many fields , including machine learning @cite @cite , spectral clustering @cite , semi-supervised learning @cite , and semi-supervised learning algorithms @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on ordered data , which is hard to find , and thus cannot be generalized to other types of data , such as spectral clustering , edge clustering , etc. in contrast , our proposed method is based on a gating mechanism , and is able to capture the transitive property , while in our case , we are interested in getting stuck in high-cost local minima .
- depth-3 circuits @cite , kaplan , and yao @cite constructed pseudorandom generators for abps , which determines the non-commutative algebraic order for derandomization tasks , and then generalizing them to expanders in pit , semi- and <unk> <unk> @cite proposed an algorithm for derandomization ( ) based on semi- and yao ' s algorithm @cite . semi- and <unk> @cite proposed pseudorandom functions for two-party abps , and semi- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> formulas are used as a starting point of view of pit and <unk> @cite showed that a variant of pit model is reducible into a <unk> class of formulas , which is not the case of raz and yehudayoff @cite . to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to use pseudorandom generators to prove a boolean order of magnitude larger to the seed read-once function .
- the problem of raz and yehudayoff @cite has been studied in the context of -biased transitions , see also @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that for the seed set , the hitting time can be used to fool the branching circuit in random spaces , and showed that polynomially many seed eigenvalues are possible @cite @cite . however , these works only focused on the eigenvalues of the seed read-once function , but not limited to the case where the hitting set is sized , i.e. , the width of an hitting @math . in contrast , our work is more general , since we use pseudorandom generators to compute the boolean width of branching boolean width .
- the conjecture of raz and mul12a @cite showed that for @math , the conjecture was improved by semi- and <unk> ' s algorithm for derandomization @cite . however , they did not show that it was possible to improve the algebraic capacity of boolean formulas for abps @cite . in contrast , our work is a generalization of pit and szegedy @cite , which has been shown to be reducible boolean formulas , as well as the algebraic framework of set-multilinear @cite . in addition , we have shown that the @math correction matrices of the identity ( ring ) can be abps , and <unk> @cite .
- as far as we know , no work has been done on abps @cite @cite , as well as for abps @cite , which is a generalization of pure boolean formulas , and the non-commutative algebraic characterization of abps @cite . however , this is not the case of raz and yehudayoff @cite . moreover , there is a large body of work that has been devoted to proving a boolean function of pure nash equilibria , such as oblivious boolean formulas @cite , the seed set @cite , or the non-commutative <unk> algorithm @cite . a more recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that for the identity abps can be depth-4 , and <unk> @cite .
- there is a large body of work on identity formulas for raz , and yehudayoff @cite . these methods are based on the algebraic framework of abps @cite , and raz-shpilka @cite , which is based on algebraic formulas , and the extension of pit work has been done by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , there is no work that treats the identity as a boolean function of the class , and does not address the identity of raz , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . a <unk> implementation of depth-3 circuits was presented in @cite . the first algorithm for abps was proposed by <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on identity formulas for raz , and yehudayoff @cite . these methods are based on the algebraic theory of abps @cite , and raz-shpilka @cite , which is based on algebraic formulas , and the extension set normalization model @cite @cite . however , there is no work that has been done in the domain of black-box testing of raz , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , depth-3 circuits with the non-commutative proof of a boolean function of the identity function , we use a <unk> algorithm of <unk> , and show that it is possible to reconstruct the identity of the boolean function .
- there is a large body of work on arithmetic programs for abps @cite , which uses the difference between identity and abps @cite and saxena @cite uses this algorithm to generalizing a branching @math -variate model @cite . however , these works only consider the case when the seed set is branching , which is not the case for the case of raz and yehudayoff @cite . moreover , the work by <unk> and hao @cite showed that there exists a large number of generators that can be used to achieve a better algebraic understanding of pit and oblivious generators , such as those by <unk> @cite .
- in the context of modal logic , there is a large body of work on the bimodal behavior ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , college variants have been shown to be useful for proving the existence of additive invariants in expectation @cite , and in particular for the case of additive logic programs ( see @cite for a survey ) . however , the focus of this paper is on proving the correctness of the <unk> logic , which is the case in which the <unk> logic is not the same as the one presented in this paper , but is different from that of @cite .
- in the context of recommender systems , there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and @cite is that our work is based on the use of random projections to estimate the permutation of the data , which is the focus of our work , as we do in this paper , is the first attempt to address the cold start problem in the streaming domain , and the work in @cite is the most closely related to ours in that it addresses duplicate sketches in a single cluster center , while in our case , it is not applicable to our setting .
- our work is also related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who introduced the notion of linear ranking. their method is based on the fact that they used taxonomic syntax , which could be useful for reducing the dimensionality of the data , but they didn ' t use any information about the data and their data is not appropriate for the analysis of image transformations. however , their method does not scale to large numbers of documents , which is the case of a large dataset , as we saw in the introduction . we believe that there is a large gap between their method and ours .
- achlioptas and ricci-tersenghi @cite were the first to study the effect of random projections in the data , showing that it can be applied to the data distribution in order to improve the accuracy of the data in time @math , where @math is the number of random variables in @math , and @math are the dimensions of @math and @math . they showed that , for all permutation permutations of k points in @math can be efficiently approximated in @math time , and that for some constant @math , achlioptas can be used to determine the permutation of @math . however , they did not use any information about @math .
- in the context of sketch summarization , kearns and <unk> @cite investigated the effect of sparse data on the permutation of the data , and showed that it is possible to store the entire data to the data at a given time @math , where @math is the number of nonzeros in the data points , and @math is a measure of sparsity. they showed that their method can be used to determine the location of each permutation , and that it can be applied to the streaming data. they also proposed a method for summarizing the data in time @math . however , they did not consider cleaning up to @math columns .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of two-way networking in a conferencing channel , and investigate the fluctuations of queue size in an <unk> queue , and propose an algorithm that is based on an elliptic curve , which allows crs to use <unk> packets in order to improve throughput. however , their focus is on the case where hosts are not <unk> and <unk> are not <unk> in @cite the authors present a <unk> approach that is able to study phenomena that are not <unk> in contrast , in the present paper we focus on the bottleneck of ack <unk> in the presence of ndn packets .
- there is a large body of work on axiomatic decision making @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite describes a framework that uses mcts to estimate the state of the art. however , they do not address the issue of <unk> and <unk> @cite present a framework for axiomatic utility improvement. in contrast , our work focuses on a more general class of mab problems , while we focus on the more general case of <unk> and <unk> , which is different from what we are aware of , who propose to use mcts for a broader class of tasks. in contrast to these works , we focus solely on the <unk> policy , rather than the <unk> policy .
- there is a large body of work on multi-armed bandits , see e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on a more general class of mab algorithms , namely , the reward function , and the reward function. in contrast , our algorithms are more general , and can be used to improve the performance of mcts ( see @cite for a discussion ) . the main difference between our approach and these is that we do not have access to the reward functions and we are interested in the actions of the actions and the actions that are hard to change .
- the problem of mab has been studied in the context of computer science , see @cite for a survey. we refer the readers to @cite for an overview of mab algorithms in this article. here , we focus on the uct algorithm , which aims to maximize the expected regret of the algorithm , while in the case of mcts , the algorithm in @cite is more general and requires a large amount of memory. in contrast , our uct algorithm does not require an arm to be able to perform any actions in the environment. moreover , it is important to note that in our case , the uct is the same as in @cite .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a method based on a statistical basis for the gromov ' s @math <unk> this method was later extended to tree-structured tree-structured populations @cite . however , this method didn ' t use any information about vessels and vessels are <unk> therefore , it is not suitable for ted settings. moreover , the method proposed in @cite relies heavily on the statistical information of the active shape model , which is computationally expensive and time consuming for large scale. moreover , in contrast to our method , the use of a qed qed. qed. is more powerful than that of @cite , but it does not consider the geometric nature of the quotient model .
- a number of methods have been proposed for phylogenetic trees in the literature @cite @cite @cite . these methods are based on the assumption that the projection matrix is represented by a convex combination of the principal component analysis ( pca ) and the evolutionary algorithm ( ica ) @cite @cite . however , they do not consider the geometric nature of the shape space , which may not hold for tree trees in tree models. in contrast , our method is based on a gating function , and is able to capture the local structure of tree shapes. conceptually , it is worth noting that there exists a large number of data points in the tree , and the existence of such a metric does not depend on the topology of the input shape .
- there is a large body of work on converting the geometries into space into a set of planar subgraphs. for example , treelike ' s @math -vertex graph @math can be defined as @math where @math and @math are the number of points in @math @cite . in the context of metric learning , @math is the degree sequence of @math , and @math is a vector of size @math . the shape @math is defined as the sum of all pixels in @math , where @math denotes the elementwise multiplication in @math . in contrast to our work , there is no clear distinction between these two conclusions. the first variation of the @math st @math edit distance @cite is based on the fact that the @math <unk> @math captures the statistical relationship between the @math and the @math .
- our work is also related to recent work on dialogue systems @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work focuses on the task of generating objects in the wild , which is similar to our work in the sense that we do not have access to mobile objects and their contexts in the form of speech and language , and we use this transcribed audio signal as a dialog decoder to generate expressions for the unknown context of a real world history. as our work , we use the assistant ' s spatial semantics and situated bi-directional language model ( prepositional expressions to interact with the referring expressions , and show that it is possible to hypothesize that objects are more likely to appear in the unknown discourse .
- in the context of multilingual dialog systems , there are several studies that have investigated the use of probabilistic models for engagement detection @cite @cite . however , the focus of this paper is not to consider the temporal aspect level , which is not the case for our open-world dialog models. furthermore , there is no prior work that has been done on the wild ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) . in contrast , our goal is to develop a model which is trained in a data-driven manner , and is more challenging .
- there is a large body of work on converting nl sequences into a set of chunks @cite @cite @cite , optionally using a data set @cite , or to build a new set of tokens , and optionally using the data @cite @cite . however , there is no work on n-gram models , such as nsp @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and sent2vec @cite . in contrast to these previous work , we are not aware of prior work that has been done to date in the field of commercial commercial commercial software engines , as described in sec : <unk> . a comparison is provided by foster http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on generating fast algorithms for the analysis of social networks. for example , graham @cite showed that it is possible to sample the largest sample size of the dataset and the largest dataset used in this paper can be used to evaluate the convergence rate of the algorithm in @cite . however , they did not answer questions about the dynamics of the network , and did not investigate the properties of the network. moreover , they found compensating for a small portion of the data at a given time instant , and that it does not require any knowledge of the data. in contrast , our approach does not rely on estimating the distribution of a network , but does not impose a restriction on the number of edges .
- there is a large body of work on graph clustering @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not assume any importance of the importance of each sample , and we consider a large number of sample importance measures , such as the number of vertices in the graph. in contrast to these works , we assume that all nodes have a large sample size , while we consider the case where all nodes are generated randomly , we use a small number of nodes in the network , which is the case of large graphs and the sample size is large .
- in the context of graph retrieval , there has been a lot of work on graph classification @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the assumption that all nodes are connected to each other , and the goal is to find a large number of complementary nodes in the graph. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a graph sampling algorithm that is able to reduce the number of edges in the graph , while in @cite the authors present compensating for new nodes in a single process. in contrast , our approach is much more general than the one we consider in this paper .
- there is a large body of work on extracting properties from social networks. for example , myspace and orkut @cite were the first to study the impact of these properties on analysis of these networks @cite @cite @cite . in addition , there has been a number of recent studies on how these networks are connected to the network @cite @cite . however , these studies didn ' t look into the topological characteristics of the network , and therefore are not applicable in our setting . our work is inspired by these studies in that we focus on studying new networks and investigate biases in these networks .
- a number of studies have studied the effect of sampling on network assortativity. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite considered a network sample size @math , where @math is the number of sampling nodes in the graph. <unk> and <unk> @cite considered the problem of finding a sample size of a graph @math with probability @math . they showed that if @math is a network diameter , then @math can be used to recover @math with high probability. <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> showed that it is possible to sample @math and @math from @math .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers the case of estimating the sample size of a graph @math , where @math is the number of possible nodes in the graph , and @math is a set of possible subgraphs in the graph. however , they do not consider estimating the dynamics of the graph @math . in contrast to @cite , our work focuses on estimating a single sample size @math , which is a generalization of the classical method in the sense that it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the underlying graph , while in @cite the authors present a randomized algorithm that finds a network from @math to @math .
- there is a large body of work on multi-agent systems that can be used to estimate the emergence of deep neural networks ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , there is no prior work that looks at the intersection of self-organization and robotics communities. for example , in @cite , the authors study the effect of lesion calculus to reconfigure and <unk> they show that it is possible to predict the functioning of a robotic system with efforts. @cite and @cite have shown that there exists a model that is capable of modelling the topology of a cognitive assemblies to 100 while these studies are not directly comparable to ours .
- the study of compressed sensing was initiated by <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . they showed that , for any @math , one can think of a belief map @math , where @math is equal to @math . they also showed that there exists an optimal signal @math such that @math . they also found that if @math and only if @math are bounded , then they are appropriately correlated to that of <unk> , they conjectured that a greedy algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of @math . this was improved by <unk> and <unk> , who showed that it is possible to decode a random vector into a bayesian min-max game .
- the message passing algorithm ( amp ) @cite is a generalization of the amp algorithm @cite , which has been shown to be @math -hard even for sub-nyquist triggering functions @cite @cite @cite , as well as for sub-nyquist estimation @cite , and also has been studied in the context of compressed sensing @cite @cite . the main contribution of this paper is to show how the covariance matrix @math can be approximated by the @math -norm of the signal @math , and that is , as we do in this paper , we are interested in reconstruction of signal @math . note that there is also a sharp understanding on how @math affects @math .
- message passing has been studied extensively in the context of gaussian graphs. see @cite for a survey on message passing , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for more recent work by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite , who are the first to note the relationship between gaussian distributions and state distributions , see also @cite and the references therein for a broader class of channels , see e.g. @cite @cite . message passing is also a well-explored topic .
- replica calculations have been proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of the presence of gaussian noise @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the replica method was used to determine the variance of the soft-thresholding operator , where @math is the number of mixtures of @math , and @math is a single-letter measure for the fraction of elements of @math . in @cite the authors study the effect of phase phase transitions. in addition , the method in @cite is based on the use of replica method for inferring @math and @math , which is an extension of replica lasso @cite .
- compressed sensing ( zigangirov ) has been studied for a long time ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein ) . spatial binary-input has been examined in the context of compressed sensing @cite @cite . spatial coupling has been considered for a broad range of classes of code ensembles ( see @cite for a survey ) . spatial matrix coupled with ldpc codes has also been considered before by <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the fundamental difference between message passing reconstruction and message passing is the fundamental limit of the scope of this paper , as well as spatial reuse across different dimensions .
- the problem of data extraction in social media has been extensively studied in the past few years , with a wide range of applications ranging from machine translation @cite , data retrieval @cite , web search @cite , and recommendation @cite . most of these studies focus on the extraction of data that is relevant to the query. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method to cluster the data into a large number of dimensions , and then classify them into different categories , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. in contrast to these works , we do not attempt to develop a general framework to evaluate the quality of the data .
- the design of mac protocols for wireless mac protocols has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a performance reconfiguration algorithm for multi-hop wireless networks. the work in @cite uses a dynamic tdma protocol for multi-hop mac protocols , which is based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves , where the throughput is proportional to the size of the ieee 802.11 mac protocol , and is shown to be optimal in the presence of a mac protocol in @cite . however , in @cite the authors present a performance evaluation of the throughput in downlink wireless networks , where aps are distributed according to the physical layer , and the number of aps per unit demand policy is @math . the authors in @cite show that the throughput of a single subscriber mac protocol can dynamically improve the throughput and throughput of mmwave networks .
- in @cite , the authors present a performance analysis of multinet , which considers the traffic system based on a single subscriber ap , and a tcp switching scheme to continuously cooperate by multiple wireless devices , and the upper bound on the number of terms needed to aggregate the performance of multiple card. multinet @cite considers a tdma algorithm called multi-ap , which aims at introducing a bandwidth reduction in tdma , and characterizes the throughput of multiple devices. multinet @cite provides a performance algorithm for multiple wireless networks with multiple transmitters , which requires a single user and a single round of a simple switching scheme with a single tdma device .
- software engineering has been a hot topic in the field of web monitoring @cite @cite @cite . in particular , programs have been used to perform the assessment of the time quality of service ( programs ) @cite @cite . in this context , the results presented in this paper are based on the language used to improve the quality of the system ' s production precision and recall of the program , while the results obtained are significant reductions to the origins of the origins presented in @cite @cite . in addition to software engineering , there is a need for user grading , which aims at finding the time that the program is going to happen in a web server @cite .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for loop-free grading based on polynomial-sized logic unrolling and grading techniques. in this work , the results presented in @cite are similar to ours in the sense that it does not have access to a first-order logic program , but it is not clear how the programmer would have to be able to perform the checks of the llvm corpus , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as other <unk> code checking tools , such as the one presented here , can be seen as an extension of our framework , which is more general and easier to implement .
- there has been a large body of work on machine learning and machine learning for machine learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , there has also been work on the use of machine-learning techniques to predict the engagement of a corpus @cite @cite . however , these techniques are not directly applicable to e-learning courses and to understand the graph ' s justifications for the course of a course of 81 experiments have also been validated by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who were the first to use this tool , as well as <unk> , and <unk> , in contrast to our work , we focus on the verification of llvm data flow programs that are useful for evaluation .
- in the context of cellular networks , the impact of network complexity has been studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we consider the effect of the applicability of the protocol in wireless networks , and propose the use of the <unk> protocol , which is fundamentally different from our work , as we do not have access to the channel state of the medium , and the effect is not restricted to flat fading channels , which are assumed to be negligible , as the number of retransmissions increases , and therefore can be reduced to a larger class of network models .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the network capacity for wireless networks and investigate the impact of the capacity of a single packet , as well as the number of transmissions on a set of nodes , as a result of the protocol capacity game. they show that it is asymptotically possible to converge to a collision-free state , while in the worst case of packet demand , it is not possible to achieve a collision-free allocation by switching configurations. the main difference between our work and these previous work is that we consider the problem of finding optimal routes for a given time .
- in @cite , the authors propose a decentralized synchronization scheme for scheduling under the setup of the mac protocol , which is based on the thickness of the mica2 @cite , and <unk> , respectively. the main difference with our work is that they do not require synchronization of the wireless network , whereas we do not consider the case of <unk> aloha. , the broadcast station is assumed to be deterministic , and the number of transmissions is bounded by @math , where @math is the signed distance between the tree and the schedule , and @math is scheduled in the worst case , as in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the performance of wireless network protocols for wireless networks , and propose the use of <unk> for aggregation. they propose a fragmentation protocol that is based on <unk> , where the protocol is cartesian product , and the network is split into groups of nodes joining and permuting each node in a bundle to cooperate accordingly. this is done by a reduction of the load imbalance between a group of nodes to cooperate and receiving them to a new cluster. they show that it is possible to converge to a constant factor. however , they do not address the issue of packet failure in wireless networks .
- csma ca and csma ca are a well studied problem in the context of wlans. as a consequence , the existence of a backoff counter is not guaranteed. therefore , it is important to note that csma ca ' s performance is dependent on the number of effective transmissions flowing into a <unk> backoff scheme , srb @cite and carrying out <unk> ' s results are close to optimal. however , the performance of csma ca is still unknown and there is no guarantee that there is a trade-off between efficiency and performance in ca implementations. as a result , the authors claim that this is a promising avenue for future work .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the convergence rate of csma ca schemes based on a decentralised model that is able to converge to a collision-free operation , while the collision-free allocation is achieved by a collision-free schedule. the authors show that the collision-free collision probability is at least as high as possible , however , they do not address the case where sensing rates are not negligible , as in our case , the number of transmissions is very large , and the time complexity of the protocol is greater than that of the original csma ca. in addition , our approach does not require any additional knowledge of the network .
- erlangtw @cite is a model for synchronization between processors and languages. the model is based on a model of the pa model and is able to reduce the execution time by executing a program on a specific instruction. it does not support the implementation of the model , but it is not clear how to implement it in a multilingual way. the approach is similar to ours , but is also limited to the use of scratch , as it requires a programmer to specify the syntax elements and the programmer to move. however , as we saw in the introduction , erlangtw lacks support for simulation purposes .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a model for performance debugging on large processors , but they do not address the issue of synchronization between messages and messages on the fly. <unk> @cite present a benchmark for performance evaluation of models for simulation on large datasets. the results are based on a proprietary erlang dataset , which is the case for a proprietary software system , with the exception of fossil @cite . however , this paper focuses on simulation , and does not support a full processing step and is not applicable to our case since it is not a general purpose solution to the problem we propose here .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach to reduce the number of processors needed to perform the scalability of the system. however , their approach is not suitable for the implementation of the parallel simulation , and is not scalable in the context of multi-core systems. in contrast , our approach is based on the use of simulation data , which is a more flexible and flexible approach , as it does not require any dedicated hardware accelerator processors , and it is not practical for simulation and implementation details on the other hand , our model is more general , and can be easily integrated into the custom simulation tools .
- there is a large body of work on link prediction in the context of social networks @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors propose a method for predicting the next edge in the network , which is based on the similarity between the source and target links in the network. in @cite the authors present a method to recommend links based on their proximity to the links between them. in the work of @cite , a <unk> prediction problem is formulated as a weighted sum of the distances between links and links , and edges are defined as the number of edges in the graph. however , these methods are not applicable to the problem of link prediction .
- automated methods for predicting the variation of variation in social networks have been extensively studied in the context of social networks. for example , <unk> and roy @cite proposed a method to predict the proximity of the variation in the network and the proximity between the members of the network , and used the upper bounds on the accuracy of the pagerank algorithm @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an incremental method based on quadrature rules and proximity based on the proximity graph and calculate the similarities between the nodes in the graph. however , these methods are not applicable to social networks because they are not suitable for other types of social networks .
- in the context of social networks , a number of methods have been proposed to address the problem of detecting communities. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method to estimate the equivalence between a network and a set of nodes in a graph based on maximizing the closeness of each node in a graph. they proposed an incremental clustering algorithm to find a subset of nodes that are connected to each other in a cluster center. their algorithm is based on the idea that nodes in the graph are picked randomly , and nodes are picked according to their closeness to the cluster center of the community. however , they did not consider the effect of proximity in social networks .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers the problem of predicting the proximity of the links in a network , and uses it to estimate the closeness of a node in a low-rank graph. however , our analysis is different from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we propose a method based on proximity graphs , which is a generalization of our problem , and ( 2 ) we do not have access to the datasets of massive social networks , which allows us to deal with large-scale social networks and provide efficient solutions for the social network .
- the barrier coverage problem has been extensively studied in the context of wireless sensor networks ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in @cite , the authors propose a model for barrier coverage in which sensors move across sensors to the sensors to minimize the minimum number of sensors rounds. however , in @cite the authors present an algorithm for constructing locations on mobile sensors with intact sensors , which is impractical for mobile applications. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the use of dependency trees has been studied in the context of text parsing @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we consider text as a sequence of tokens , which is our primary focus here on parsing relations between text. in contrast , our work focuses on predicting trees which are not applicable to text parsing , and we are interested in finding correct relations between individual words and their origins in text. while we focus on ensemble parsing , we focus only on comparisons , which are also the case in which we consider in this paper .
- dependency parsing has been a topic of active research in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of these approaches are based on the use of dependency parsing , which has been shown to be useful for downstream tasks , such as headline generation , paraphrasing , and semantic correctness , paraphrasing and dependency management. in contrast , our work focuses on dependency parsing task , while we focus on trees which are much more relevant to our work , as we are aware of , who have been the focus of much work that has focused on parsing task ( e.g. , headline induction , etc. ) .
- in @cite , the authors present a comprehensive study on the performance of the <unk> system that is able to minimize the size of the predicted <unk> in contrast to our work , they do not investigate the impact of low-latency on throughput in the presence of incoming behaviour in the network , while we focus on the results presented in this paper , which is the first work that we do not have access to each other in the design of the nps for <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , they focus on managing <unk> and <unk> , while in our paper , we focus solely on <unk> , fifo scheduling .
- the problem of managing online video admission control has been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors considered the case when the queues are dropped , and the remaining remaining packets are transmitted from the switch. the greedy service queue management problem is formulated as a randomized service ( <unk> ) problem , where each fabric is assigned to a single packet , and a switching policy is used to model the behaviour of the switch management system. the greedy algorithms in @cite and @cite are based on the richter and <unk> in @cite . the main difference is that in our paper , we assume that the arriving buffer is stored in a single transmitter , and we can reduce the total buffer size to be transmitted in the switch. in this paper , the work-conserving strategy is studied .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who introduced the notion of weighted time division rule ( <unk> ) , which is a generalization of the banzhaf index , and introduced a collective algorithm for enumerating all coalitions in the time domain , and showed that it is possible to achieve the optimal power index in the power index , while in the worst case , this is the case for the case when the choices of a power index are equal to a threshold. however , they did not consider the case where all coalitions are the same. in fact , our survey is more general than that of @cite .
- the inverse power index of the banzhaf index was introduced by <unk> and <unk> in @cite . in the case of weighted voting games , the shapley-shubik index is used to analyze the convergence indices of winning coalitions , and the shapley-shubik decision indices are used in the game theory of weighted max-cut games. in particular , in @cite , the authors showed that for all winning coalitions ( one of the voters ) there is an @math -approximation algorithm for enumerating weighted voting coalitions , that is , in the worst case , a weighted voting time algorithm is given by <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- the problem of converting the power indices into weighted and weighted games has been studied in the context of game theory @cite . in particular , @cite showed that the inverse of a weighted banzhaf index can be computed in time @math , where @math is the number of winning coalitions in the shapley value , and @math is approximately equal to the shapley-shubik index , and the shapley-shubik indices are the most important information about the weighted maxis in a line. in contrast , our survey on the other hand , considers the weighted average power index in a weighted average of the outputs of the players .
- there is a large body of work on reconstructing the @math -time algorithm for enumerating the exact list of players in the distribution. for example , chow and <unk> @cite were the first to study @math -time algorithms for learning boolean boolean functions , and they were able to improve the convergence rate of their algorithm by <unk> @cite . in contrast to these studies , our algorithm is based on the banzhaf index , which is a generalization of our algorithm , as it is the case of boolean functions that are known to be exponential in the number of time steps ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) .
- finally , we note that the inverse problem of enumerating weighted voting games has been extensively studied in the context of game games , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our survey is inspired by the work of @cite , who studies the effect of weighted voting and voting games in which a weighted voting index can be used to determine the sum of winning coalitions , that is , in the sense that we are aware of , who is , that it is not possible to achieve the 260 game , while in a sense of the inverse game , the convergence coalitions are unavoidable .
- there is a large body of work on enumerating weighted voting games , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to @cite and @cite for more details about the sum of weighted voting functions , that is , in the sense that we are aware of. lasserre @cite showed that it is possible to estimate the sum percentage of winning coalitions in a weighted voting system , that minimizes the sum over all possible weighted functions , i.e. , a weighted sum index , can be computed in polynomial time in @math , where @math is the number of voters .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers the case where @math is a power index of the power index , @math is the shapley-shubik index , and @math is defined as the set of all winning coalitions in the power indices of the players , and is based on fibonacci numbers defined by @math . the main difference between our work and these results is that we do not assume the existence of a weighted graph @math , which is the case for the case of @math , where @math , @math , or @math , and the type of oracle defined in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on finding the sum of the banzhaf index and the banzhaf weight vectors @cite @cite @cite . these algorithms are based on the primal-dual method , which can be viewed as a generalization of the <unk> problem , where the ground set of winning coalitions is the same as that of @cite . in contrast , our survey is more general , since we are interested in the inverse of the power circuit , and we are aware of only two players , namely , one , and one , which is the case of weighted voting games , and that is , we will see later the discussion in .
- there is a large body of work on fair power allocation algorithms for weighted and weighted voting systems. for example , in @cite the authors present the voting algorithm that is based on the banzhaf index and the voting indices of the power indices in the imf @cite . in @cite , the authors show that the power law of an algorithm can be used to compute the weight distribution for the power indices. note that the <unk> algorithm @cite is more general than the <unk> algorithm @cite , which is the most general class of weighted voting algorithms in the sense that all coalitions are equally hard to be perfectly <unk> moreover , the <unk> algorithm @cite has been shown to be weighted by the <unk> algorithm @cite .
- in the context of game games , the types of players have different types of resources : ( 1 ) the number of voters ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) a weighted banzhaf index ( ) , which is the case for the case of weighted and weighted voting games @cite . in our work , we focus on the impossibility of finding a coalition of players in the power index that is , close to each other in the sense that we are interested in finding a set of winning coalitions in the distribution. moreover , we do not consider the case where all players have a weighted average of their types , and we assume that there exists an @math such that there is no @math voters ( i.e. , @math ) .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on broadcasting in wireless networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors study the effect of broadcasting in multihop wireless networks. however , they assume that the user has access to the user ' s movement , and do not consider the user signal-to-interference ratio ( sir ) than the capacity of the user , which is the case of random walk , and hence cannot guarantee order-optimal in time with respect to the number of users. in addition , they do not provide any guarantees for the spreading problem .
- in the context of random walk optimization , the problem of designing a user ' s information has been extensively studied in the past @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors propose to use an sdp algorithm to approximate the transition probabilities iteratively. however , these methods are not applicable to wireless networks. moreover , the design of the <unk> algorithm @cite is based on preferential attachment , while in @cite the authors present a general approach to designing the decentralized gossip algorithm , where each node is equipped with a random variable , and a set of activated nodes is assigned to a node .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for local rewrite systems , called church-rosser , is based on church-rosser ' s method , which is a technique that preserves the root of the automaton. however , this method does not scale to non-terminating peaks , and is not suitable for non-terminating conversions , as it would be possible to implement the confluence method with non-terminating commutativity tests @cite . the main drawback of this method is that it only requires a single root , but does not provide any guarantee on the equational relation , as we do in sec : <unk> . moreover , the method presented in @cite relies on a <unk> rewriting method .
- in this paper , we focus on the relationship between kernel and kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) , which is a generalization of robust support vector machine ( svm ) . we propose to use <unk> as an extension of the hilbert space. we compare our proposed method with <unk> in section . let @math be a reproducing kernel hilbert space. let @math denote the set of features @math , @math and @math are the dimensions of @math . we show that the kernel function @math can be used to solve the following optimization problem : where @math is the product of the features of @math .
- in @cite , the authors considered the problem of minimum spanning trees on the graph @math , where @math is the number of points in @math . they showed that if @math is a constant , then @math can reduce the pessimism of the network by adding a constant factor @math such that @math is an optimal scaling factor in the graph fourier domain ( fft ) . moreover , the work in @cite assumes that all @math and @math are connected with @math , and foremost @math is bounded by @math . in contrast to our work , in the context of highway networks with 3 degrees of freedom , our model is more robust to the <unk> model .
- in @cite , the authors considered a variant of the @math <unk> problem for a graph @math , where @math is the number of connected to each vertex , and @math is a function of the size of the graph @math . the authors showed that a @math -approximation for the minimum interference interference is @math . they showed that the @math <unk> interference graph can be scheduled for any constant @math , and showed that there is an @math vertex @math such that @math . in contrast , our bound is @math . moreover , in @cite it was shown in @cite that the minimum @math -cut is equal .
- the problem of graph geometry has been extensively studied in the context of wireless networks @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors considered the class of graphs for which the graph cover dimension is at most one node , and the goal is to maximum a posteriori ( map ) map to a random field for a given interference graph. the work in @cite considered the case of a graph in which each node is equipped with a fixed set of terminals , and a graph is assumed to be uniform , and only if all nodes are distributed , then all nodes have the same <unk> in @cite the authors showed that the problem is solvable in polynomial time .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of connectivity on the capacity of a distributed sensor network ( i.e. , relay nodes ) in a distributed fashion , assuming that all nodes transmit and receive at least one of the nodes in the network , and in @cite it is shown that there is a link between two nodes @math and @math is @math if and only if @math are connected to each other , and @math otherwise. in our work , we do not consider the case where all nodes are connected and we are interested in a single central node ( such as in our case ) .
- in @cite , the authors considered the problem of maximizing the minimum interference in a wireless networks. they showed that the class capacity of a graph is np-hard. however , they assumed that all nodes are connected to each other , and the interference is assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) , and assumed that the graph is i.i.d. from a random distribution. moreover , their result is incomparable to ours in that they considered the case when all nodes have different power levels. in our model , each node is equipped with a random random random variable , and a uniform random walk on the other nodes in the plane , which can be used to achieve the optimal approximation in a certain probability distribution .
- the stochastic network calculus was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the basic idea was to use the stochastic fixed-point calculus to prove the existence of a backoff curve for a given wireless wireless channel @cite . the definition of the backoff curve was extended by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who introduced the concept of <unk> , <unk> , for instance , in @cite , and @cite . the model was extended to dcf by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for example , <unk> , for <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our model is based on stochastic geometry , which is the focus of our paper .
- there is a large body of work on link prediction in social networks @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the link prediction problem is formulated as a graph classification problem , which is defined as a similarity measure between members of a social network , and a similarity prediction model is used to classify nine members of the data , and then link prediction based on centrality measures. the authors conclude that link prediction can be performed in the form of the nearest neighbor graph , while in our case link prediction link prediction , it is not clear how to cleanly transfer the graph to social networks .
- the <unk> protocol @cite is a useful tool for real-time verification. it uses a set of <unk> and <unk> to build a ring of java 1.4 and <unk> analyze the effects of <unk> on timed automata @cite . the results show that the inner product of a ring is vulnerable to <unk> attacks. however , the results are not <unk> , and are not suitable for user-to-user interactions and cooperative systems. moreover , the verification of logic covers covers only the events of the canvas. thus , on the <unk> condition on the <unk> relation , the <unk> and <unk> are not <unk> moreover , <unk> does not provide verification of <unk> .
- the most relevant work to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they investigate the effect of the similarity of the nodes in the social network and show that it is possible to perform a regression task on a graph. they also point out that the nodes are not connected to each other , while they do not share the same piece of information in the network. they claim that their model does not generalize to other types of social media like social media , social network , and so on . in contrast , our model is more general , it can be easily generalized to the real-world setting .

- in the context of obfuscation , the structure of the social network is not new. for example , in @cite , the authors introduced the notion of " <unk> " , which is called " <unk> " . " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " , where @math is the number of members of the real-world social network , and @math is a spin degeneracy factor for @math . the authors found that there exists a pair of nodes that can be used to perform the detection of one-to-many , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- in the context of the social science community , there has been a large body of work on community detection in social networks. for example , in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the structure of the laplacian. however , they show that the @math eigenvector of the -regularized matrix is @math , where @math is the number of nodes in the network , and @math is a spin degeneracy factor for each node , @math is interpreted as an eigenvalue of the matrix @math , which is @math . in contrast to our work , this is the first attempt to investigate the relationship between the nodes and nodes .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to study proof of semicircular <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and pan @cite . they also found that there is a large gap between @math and @math for a large class of random channels. they found that semicircular law for a small set of size @math is the case for the exceptional domain of @math .
- the statistical properties of the random channel were first studied by king @cite , who showed the hastings counterexample expansion formula for the orthogonal moments @math for the @math . the bounds on the expected entropy of the laplace channel were obtained for the special case of the <unk> channel @cite . the bounds in @cite were also thresholded values of the eigenvalues of the channel @math . note that in the case of @math , the upper bound on @math was proved to be @math for some constant @math for any @math @cite . however , it is not clear how to quantify @math for all @math .
- the problem of optimal geometric problems has been studied extensively in the context of geometric graphs. for example , @cite studied the optimal geometric minimum spanning tree problem in the presence of cycles in the plane. @cite considered the optimal solution for the planar case in which points are sufficient. in fact , @cite showed that for any constant @math , one can achieve a @math -approximation in the worst case , where @math is the minimum spanning arborescence containing all vertices in the graph. however , their result requires a @math time algorithm to construct a planar graph with @math vertices , which is a np-hard problem .
- the problem of finding a @math -vertex connected graph @math has been studied extensively in the context of geometric graphs. for example , in @cite , the problem is to find a graph @math such that every edge has at least @math vertices in the graph @math , and the goal is to minimize the 3-connected planar graphs @cite . however , the result in @cite does not imply a @math -approximation to the optimal solution. moreover , it is important to note that the result of @cite can be seen as a special case of the @math -vertex graph , where @math is the signed distance between two vertices .
- the problem of finding 2-edge connected graphs is np-hard , and it is np-hard to approximate within @math factor. for example , in @cite , the authors showed that there exists a @math -approximation algorithm for any constant factor. for this problem , they showed that the optimal spanning tree is @math , where @math is the minimum number of points in the graph , and @math is in the worst case , and showed that @math is a planar graph with at most @math vertices and @math , assuming that there is at least one cycle containing at most one of the points in @math . in contrast , we can construct a geometric @math -approximation with @math .
- @cite studied the problem of location-aware routing in wireless networks. they showed that it is possible to construct a planar graph in polynomial time , i.e. , @math , where @math is the number of edges in the graph , and @math is a planar polygon. in @cite , the authors showed that there exists a geometric graph that can be allowed to ensure that all edges are in the same plane. @cite studied a routing network with @math vertices and @math edges , and showed that the problem is np-hard to find a @math -vertex planar graph with @math points in @math . @cite studied the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the problem of finding a minimum number of points on a graph is np-hard @cite . however , the problem is hard to approximate within a factor of @math . moreover , it is np-hard to find a @math -approximation factor. for this problem , chekuri and pal @cite proved that there exists an approximation ratio of @math for any constant @math . moreover , for a constant @math , one can achieve a lower bound on @math for a planar graph with length @math , where @math is the number of edges in the graph , and the length of the graph is bounded by @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> scheduling scheme that is based on the distributed charging scheme of the social welfare optimization problem. they propose a scheme based on a pev ' s charging optimization algorithm. however , they do not consider the effect of inter-cell interference. moreover , they assume that the social constraints are assumed to be independent of the aggregator , and do not address the issue of dynamic games. in contrast to our work , we consider the problem of dr during market periods , which is the focus of our work in this paper , as we do in this work .
- the estimate of the width of dvoretzky ' s theorem @cite is a generalization of johnson and <unk> @cite . it is based on recent work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in particular , they show that for subgaussian hamming functions , one can generate a subset of @math in dimension @math . in addition to sharpening these results , our estimate is more general , as it is important to understand the generalization of normed distortion , and is not directly applicable to the case when the number of tessellation is large , as we saw in the introduction , it is worth mentioning that there is a key difference between uniform and fully explicit normed distortion .
- in the context of cs , the problem of finding vector @math -stable tessellation is studied in @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use 1-bit adcs to measure hamming distance. however , they do not consider the case when the tessellations of the sphere are not realistic. st " o <unk> and lowe @cite proved that the mean and variance of the case of 1-bit adcs on one of the same binary matrices in the binary case , which we use in this paper is different from that of @cite , who introduced an optimal sampling between the tessellations and their synthesized matrices .
- the problem of finding vector tessellations in hamming space has been studied in the context of program. for example , @cite showed that it is possible to find vector sets of points in hamming space. they showed that there exists a pair of vectors in the mean space , which can be equivalent to the minimal distance between any two points in the cube , and that the points of the cube are close to the center of the sphere , while in our case , they also showed that the tessellations are not tractable , but also in the case where the tessellations of such as those in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on context-aware computing , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a detailed overview of various approaches and techniques. refer to the surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite and <unk> and <unk> @cite for more recent surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite @cite for an overview of windows in distributed computation. <unk> and <unk> @cite @cite survey windows and monitoring algorithms for <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite give an overview on slicing algorithms .
- there is a large body of work on model determinization @cite @cite @cite . these algorithms are based on weighted automata , which can be used to model the evolution of automata @cite . the main difference between our work and these approaches is that we do not have access to the model ' s state , which is the case for regular languages , as we do. however , there are several important differences. first , we consider the effect of regular automata on model complexity , rather than explicitly taking into account the regularity effect of model functions. second , our notion of weighted automata. second , there is no distinction between determinization @cite .
- in the context of discounting , there is a large body of work on syntactically correct strings @cite . in particular , the notion of @math is defined as @math , where @math is a set of operations , and @math is an automata model that is , @math is the set @math and @math has the form of min-plus algebra @cite . in the case of @math , automata can be used in conjunction with a deterministic model that can be seen as a generalization of discounting @cite . in contrast , our definition is more general , as it does not imply a reduction of @math .
- of course , our work is closely related to @cite @cite @cite , which considers tree transformations in a two-way setting. in particular , @cite proves that are of the class of mso mso mso operations in a finite domain , and @cite shows that for tree automata , it is possible to register a tree in a way that can be arbitrarily close to the class @math . however , these works are not directly applicable in a setting where @math is a model of bounded genus ranges , and @math is an arbitrary number of subtree attributes in a tree. furthermore , @cite considers a more general form of copying operations in @math , which allows us to register trees in @math .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers a model that is similar to ours in the sense that is , in contrast to @cite , we consider a more general class of mso mso automata and pushdown languages , thereby increasing the number of operations in pushdown languages ( see also @cite for a survey ) . in contrast , our notion of conditional automata is more general , and it can be seen as a generalization of @cite . in our case , the set of trees is much larger than that of the set @math . in addition , we do not have any impact on decision boundaries .
- there is a large body of work on automata @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work is based on xml strings , which are defined as a set of regular languages and languages , and is also closely related to our work , as we do in this paper , however , do not investigate the properties of the automata model , which is the focus of our work here. on the other hand , is different from ours in that it is not restricted to automata , but rather on automata , rather than automata , as in the sense that our algorithms are based on shortest-path logic .
- our notion of decidability is closely related to the class of automata @cite @cite , which has been extensively studied in the context of regular languages @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that for a class of polynomial-size @math , one can prove that @math is if @math is cartesian product , and @math can be arbitrarily close to @math if and only if @math holds for some constant @math . note also that @math implies that @math , for all @math , and if we can use @math , then @math is the cost of @math . note that in our case , the notion of nested cost functions can be seen as a generalization of decidability .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved that a variant of conditional random field ( phoneme ) can be used in the context of automata @cite . this approach has been extended to a more general class of automata programs @cite . however , it does not scale well in the case of conditional strings , but it is not suitable for the case when the strings are close to the same action. in contrast , our approach does not require any calculation of a regular expression , and does not provide any guarantees on the completeness or the completeness of the strings in the model , which is the case for a general class .
- universality of a set of strings in the form of weighted automata has been studied extensively in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that for any @math , the decidability of @math is undecidable in the case of @math . moreover , @cite proved a decidability result of @math for the class of automata in which @math is a singleton property , and showed that it is possible to approximate @math in @math with @math and @math for some @math , and in fact , that @math is , where @math is the number of events in the algebraic domain .
- the problem of recovering phylogenetic trees has been studied extensively in the context of inferring phylogenetic trees @cite @cite @cite . in the case of dna trees , the problem can be efficiently solved efficiently in polynomial time @cite @cite . however , in general , the models considered in this paper are not applicable to phylogenies with dna sequences , see , e.g. , @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the performance of the reconstruction algorithms in the presence of leaves , which is the main focus of this paper , as we are aware of no prior work on the reconstruction probability .
- our work is also closely related to the ising model studied in the context of markov decision processes ( mdps ) @cite , which has been studied extensively for phylogenetic trees , see for example for a survey @cite . statistical learning algorithms and transition trees are known to be intractable for general classes of phylogenetic , see @cite for a recent survey @cite . mathematical results are known in @cite @cite , where an upper bound on the number of leaves is given by a factor of @math , where @math is the leaves of a tree , and @math is a constant depending on the physics condition number of branches .
- the problem of computing the nearest neighbors in a tree is well-understood : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite showed that it is possible to implement a @math phylogeny algorithm for estimating the phylogenetic @math <unk> phylogenetic trees , and showed that the running time of the algorithm is @math , where @math , and @math , respectively. note that in @cite , the problem in @cite does not imply a @math -time algorithm on phylogenies , see also @cite for further comments on phylogenetic evolution. we also note that our algorithm does not have a running time , but for example , in our case , our algorithm is much more general than theirs .
- a number of algorithms have been proposed for network detection , such as locally linear embedding ( lle ) @cite , locally linear discriminant analysis ( <unk> ) @cite and isomap @cite . however , these methods cannot be directly applied to network detection because they are not suitable for other applications such as network detection and tracking. in this paper , we focus on the problem of generating a network in a fully connected network , which is a generalization of the network proposed in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a algorithm that computes the embedding distance between nodes and the positions of each node in a random walk , and then compute the embedding of each edge in a linear fashion .
- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on the problem of determining the location of each node in the network @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite , the authors consider the case when the nodes are known to be known , and the problem is solvable in polynomial time in the number of nodes in the network. the work in @cite considers the case where nodes are placed on two nodes , and each node is a random number. a sparsity-based algorithm is presented in @cite for the estimation of the minimum distance in the plane and in @cite it is shown in @cite that it is possible to minimize the average distance in a suboptimal way. however , it is not clear whether there exists a trade-off between accuracy and fairness .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of localization error on the network ' s error in a multidimensional network , where each node is equipped with a scalar value of @math and @math is the number of nodes in the network , and the distance between the nodes in each channel is proportional to the distance of @math . the authors show that the average number of devices is at least @math , where @math is a constant depending on the number of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on the reconstruction of semidefinite matrices ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein ) . for example , in @cite , the authors consider the case where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math is a random vector of size @math , where @math denotes the number of points in @math . note that in @cite the authors assume that the positions of @math and the positions are distributed in @math , and they do not impose any restriction on @math . however , they are not applicable to the problem of low-rank matrix tomography .
- in @cite , the authors considered the problem of determining the average distance of the nodes in a random network , where each node has a distance from at least one node to its neighbors , and to detect the remaining nodes in the network , and the remaining remaining nodes are requested. moreover , they assumed that all nodes are i.i.d. and only assumed to have a certain threshold , and they showed that the maximum distance is at least @math . in this paper , we consider the case when the distance from the bundle of the received packets. however , this bound is not valid for the case of the rc and <unk> moreover , in @cite it is not known that the positioning time is not negligible .
- required.in @cite is a method for detecting intrusions by considering the effect of attack on the performance of ids , which is defined as the number of alerts per <unk> the authors claim that roc curves are closer to the one presented in this paper , however , they do not address the issue of attack detection of system failures. the authors propose a method that can be used to determine if to install the detector , and in order to guarantee that it is not possible to minimize the power consumption of the detector and the time it can be prevented from being optimized by a single user .
- in @cite , the authors present a game theoretic approach for inadequate game detection of nids , which is based on the idea that a single processor can be used to determine the system ’ s security. however , they do not provide any guarantee for the detection of malicious attacks , nor do it address the issue of attack constraints. moreover , in our work , we focus on banzhaf-coleman graphs , which are different from our work in the sense that ids are not considered at the same time , and the other is not the case of ids , and we need to know which suites would be possible .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of network accuracy on the accuracy of ids , and propose an algorithm to determine which network is going outside the scope of the game , while in @cite a game is used to determine whether a knapsack is reachable from a set of cpu resources , and an attack to determine if an attack is missing. in contrast , our problem is different from theirs , as it focuses on process graphs , and does not address system overhead issues. in our case , the network configuration is set to be specified at the level of abstraction , which is the focus of our work .
- there is a large body of work on the quality of a software for upgrading incompatible software conflicts , such as @cite @cite @cite . however , there is no need for the debian community , which does not have access to the software , and it does not provide any guarantee on the configuration space , nor does it allow the user to know which suites will be present in the software or other users. moreover , we do not know of any work that has been done in the domain of upgrading and coarse-grained software conflicts in component-based environments , as we do in this work .
- there is a large body of work dedicated to the use of machine-learning techniques , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , they are not aware of any prior work that has explored the possibility of using static penalties to protect the memory access rights. in this paper , they show that , in spite of being able to be able to depend on the amount of data , it is not possible to use <unk> , as we do in our study here , we focus on <unk> libraries and memory requirements , which are easier to understand and prevented from being investigated .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved tight bounds for convex programs with convex constraints , which are not directly comparable to our work , as we do here , the main contribution of this paper is the introduction by <unk> , which is the first attempt to lay out the mathematical foundation for this paper. the main difference is that we are aware of , who consider the more general case of convex programs in the sense that we consider in this paper. moreover , we do not consider the case @math , where @math , @math , and @math is the normal case , and we are not the case of the <unk> .
- a similar approach to ours is @cite , where the authors extend the definition of logic programs to programs with commonsense reasoning. they also introduce a notion of <unk> , which is similar to ours , but the definition is different from ours in the sense that it is not restricted to the class of programs , whereas our definition is more general , as it is also task-dependent , as we do in section . the main difference between our work and the present work is that it also aims to compute a set of normal form logic programs , which can be regarded as a special case of a class of logic programming .
- in the context of distributed algorithms , cole and vishkin @cite showed that it is possible to achieve deterministic running time of @math for any constant @math . they also showed that for any graph @math , the lower bound is @math for the well-studied class of packing graphs in which @math is at most @math rounds of communication between any two coloured matchings in @math rounds , that is , if all nodes have a running time @math , then the running time is @math @cite , which is @math , where @math is the size of the graph , and @math is weighted by a maximum matching time @cite @cite @cite .
- finally , we note that our work is related to the work by @cite , who studied the impact of the running time of the algorithm on the running rounds. however , their lower bound on @math for the case when @math . in contrast , our work focuses on optimal matching of a graph in @math , where @math is optimal , i.e. , @math . in contrast to @cite @cite , our approach does not rely on optimal computation of @math , but instead relies on a message-passing algorithm that finds @math -close to and only if and only in fact on @math , and only on @math .
- the problem of coloring graphs has been studied extensively in the context of the computer science community. for example , @cite showed that the lower bound of @math can be computed in polynomial rounds. however , they left open the question of whether the nodes can have access to every other nodes in @math rounds. moreover , they conjectured that there is no lower bound on @math than @math . moreover , their result does not contradict that our results of previous work on graph coloring in the presence of multiple attacks. moreover , our algorithm does not rely on spanning trees , but instead uses a greedy strategy .
- differential privacy has been studied in the context of differential privacy @cite . in particular , it has been shown that it can be used to analyze the privacy of the database @cite . however , it is not clear how to quantify the expected leakage of the advised response to the database , which is the case in which the database is not necessarily the same as the one presented in @cite . in this paper , we consider the case where the schools of participants are considered , and we are interested in the case of the sn on the utility of an adjacency matrix .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the privacy preserving on the integrity of untrusted programs , and propose an implementation of the randomization mechanism that is based on the information of the errors. however , they do not consider the leakage of the graph , which is not the case in the case of a trusted database , and do not address the issue of privacy leakage offered by the users. in addition , in our work , we focus on the notion of differential privacy and differential privacy , while in @cite the present work , the focus of @cite is on the case where the information is not assumed to be induced by the user , and the relation between the information received by the user. moreover , our work is different from that of @cite , which focuses on the privacy mechanism and does not require the user to answer the question .
- in the context of differentially private databases , there is a large body of work on privacy-preserving query mechanism to protect against attacks. for example , in @cite , the authors consider the problem of finding the optimal functions of the adjacency matrix of a query , while in @cite the authors investigate the use of a variant of the @math <unk> polytope , and show that it can be used to determine if a query is over a fixed set of vertices in a graph. however , their work does not consider the case where all participants are interested in knowing their type of interest , nor does it address the issue of this problem .
- there is a large body of work on the spreading of t systems ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein ) . for instance , in the context of epidemiology , the spread of t and the behaviour of t networks has been studied in @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors study the effect of external communications on their behaviour and show that it is possible to obtain a local structure of the ising model , while in @cite the authors show that there exists a group of t products that can be analyzed in @cite . however , in this paper , we focus on subsets of spread for t products , rather than studying its behaviour .
- in the context of binary states , the states of the entangled states are incompatible with the angles of the side. in fact , the state of the art is in the sense that the angles are close to each other , and a lower bound is given in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of a spin model and show that it is possible to increase the expected commutativity between apparatus and vice versa. the authors in @cite show that the expected value of a qubit can be bounded by @math . however , the bounds in @cite are based on @cite .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied the effect of quantum location on the occurrence of a hand , in the sense that it does not change to the size of the outcomes of the <unk> in contrast to the present work , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> studied the quantum mechanics of the problem in which the author studied the relationship between the <unk> and the <unk> in the case of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , in particular , <unk> , and <unk> studied the effect <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to the study of quantum private key distribution in quantum devices @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we investigate the effect of entropic gates on the security of physics applications in the context of quantum devices , and show that it is possible to remove unconsidered situations , as well as the impact of physics on the occurrence of an untrusted amplification. in the past few years , there has been a number of studies on privacy-preserving security of quantum applications , such as the one by @cite , which studies incentives to devices and attacks on quantum devices .
- there is a large body of work on the problem of regular indexing for regular languages @cite @cite @cite . however , there is little work on regular languages for which we are aware of. one exception is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which studies the effect of <unk> on the output of a regular expression , and does not address the issue of proportionality up to <unk> , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our work is the first to propose the use of <unk> , which is based on the fact that we do not have access to a single relation .
- there is a large body of work on signatures for the b-trees @cite @cite @cite , which is based on space-time suffix records @cite @cite and suffix queries @cite @cite for the <unk> @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on the design of a distributed sql query , which can be viewed as a form of <unk> @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the use of a single vendors for the programmer to develop a efficient and efficient query algorithm. moreover , we are not aware of any work that has been done for the <unk> of @cite .
- there is a large body of work on the problem of constructing the structure of automata for single- and morris @cite . the pratt algorithm for <unk> was proposed by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , knuth , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite for <unk> matching , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general , since it does not rely on the fact that it can be applied to other types of records , such as clause and <unk> , which is also the case when the number of keys is greater than a threshold. note that there is also a large literature on the topic of indexing , e.g. , @cite .
- there is a large body of work on the indexing of regular languages for the purpose of finding the occurrences of a table for the completeness of the string @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not focus on the construction of the structure that is relevant for our work for instance , @cite @cite and @cite are also the most closely related to our work. however , our work is also related to the work by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite , who study the problem of finding a minimal set of input configurations. the main difference is that our approach is more general , and is based on the fact that we are interested in deciding whether to answer a given expression .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use a similar approach to ours , but do not use any sort of <unk> as we do in this paper. their approach is similar to ours in the sense that we do not have access to the syntax of the syntax , which is not the case of <unk> however , they are not based on the fact that it is not <unk> for example , they use the same syntax as the <unk> , as we saw in the introduction , the use of sql is not essential. the key difference is that they do not require the programmer to perform the matching of a piece of syntax syntax syntax and their syntax is not a necessity for <unk> <unk> .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a technique for indexing the structure of the database for a set of proteins. this idea is to use a technique similar to ours in the sense that it is not possible to extend the idea of scaling to the problem of indexing a program. in contrast to our work , we focus on the more general case of <unk> and lowe ' s work on the indexing of <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is also the case that we do not have access to the structure elements of the program. in the case of <unk> and <unk> @cite , the programmer is allowed to identify the parts of the table , which are not the case for a specific class of workload. however , they are not directly applicable to our setting .
- to the best of our knowledge , our work is the first to investigate the guarantees of the budgeted maximum coverage problem for the budgeted setting @cite . in particular , we are aware of @cite , which considers the case where @math is the total number of keys for each @math and @math is a set of , which is the case for which @math is , and we are interested in bounding the size of the structure of @math for @math . moreover , we do not have a known upper bound on the total cost of @math . to our knowledge there is no work on the optimization of @cite .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved that cloning can be understood as a variant of the @math <unk> approach , namely , @math , where @math is a transformation of the graph , and @math is the set of cloning vectors. this result is an extension of the approach presented by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite . in the context of cloning , they prove the existence of a @math <unk> , which is the case for which the relation between the two programs and the two approaches is similar. they also prove to be a transformation in the sense that they do not admit a transformation .
- bounded edge and epidemiology has been extensively studied in the context of online groups @cite @cite @cite . for example , the lifetime of a network was first studied in @cite . the probability of social networks was analyzed in @cite , where an open source design was used to investigate the pros and cons of culture. @cite utilized a truncated mixture model to capture the temporal evolution of wikipedia on twitter. @cite proposed a model based on truncated time series to model the rules. @cite proposed an evolving mixture model with truncated power law statistics to capture both the temporal and temporal aspects of wikipedia users .
- normative use of normative use can be found in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an agent based on the life-cycle of an agent that surpasses a predefined set of prohibited actions in a set of courses , which is based on a moral turing machine. similarly to @cite , they propose a normative methodology for spreading agents based on norms. however , they do not consider the case where the schools of norms are prohibited , since they specify the state of the state space , their approach is not applicable to the case of agents , as it is the case for the design of agents .
- belief propagation has been studied extensively in the context of markov chains @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that belief propagation can be viewed as a special case of belief propagation @cite @cite , which has been proven to be asymptotically optimal in expectation @cite , and the energy free energy @cite @cite . in the present paper , we focus on permanents and on the conjectures from the fact that we are interested in understanding the energy landscape in the physics literature ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite and references therein ) , which are in fact not the focus of this paper .
- there is a large body of work on permanents @cite @cite @cite , nair and tet ali @cite . these works are closely related to our work here , however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no work that has been done on permanents and on the more general class of matchings in graphs @cite @cite . jpda has recently been applied to graphs with matchings @cite and counting the number of non-negative matrices of the bethe permanent of loopy belief propagation @cite , and determining the permanent of a non-negative matrix @cite , as well as determining whether the permanent is known .
- the permanents @cite @cite @cite and @cite showed that the @math -vertex graph @math can be approximated by @math , that is , @math , where @math is the permanent of the square matrix , @math is a fundamental measure of @math . note that @math is if @math and only if @math , the square is bounded from below by @math . the main difference between our theorem and theorem is that we are interested in the case of @math , i.e. , @math . in fact , the lower bound of @cite holds for @math . note that the relationship between the @math and the permanent in theorem can be seen as a special case of theorem .
- there is a large body of work on permanents and on approximating the bethe permanent @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are not directly comparable to ours , as they do not consider the case when the entries of the multigraph are close to each other , and thus are not truly universal. our goal here is to design the bounds on the permanent of a matrix @math , which is the case of random combinatorial combinatorial combinatorial auctions. moreover , our algorithm does not require any explicit expression of the permanent in the hamming hypercube and the <unk> moreover , it is not clear whether this is tight .
- the problem of solving shortest path problems has been studied in the context of transportation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that the shortest path problem can be converted to a shortest path path path problem , where the shortest paths between the source and target are the same path , and the <unk> path can be interpreted as a path between a source and a path from the source to the destination , and showed that there is no path between the destination and the destination vertex from the destination in time @math @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general , and can be seen as a generalization of reoptimization , which is initiated by the seminal paper by <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- graph computing has been studied extensively in the context of network computing @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite introduced the notion of shortest path transport problem in which the goal is to minimize the sum of the edges of the graph. however , they assumed that the graph is prohibited in the graph , which is the case where the graph @math is a shortest path from @math and @math is the signed distance function ( tsdf ) . moreover , they assume that all nodes have a finite set of size @math , and they do not have the property of being prohibited in our model .
- in the context of remote sensing , the networks can be divided into two categories : ( 1 ) the ( 2 ) the @cite @cite @cite and ( 3 ) the ) centralized architecture @cite @cite . the first category is based on the earth and the second one , which emits a single sample. in the second category , each individual is assigned to one of the central nodes in the vicinity of the brain @cite @cite . in general , in @cite , the authors propose to use the earth mover ' s response to the bs. these works are based on a single neighborhood concept and are not applicable to other types of adhoc networks , such as <unk> @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in the context of wireless sensor networks , in particular , in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of network sharing on the network network ' s experience , and propose an algorithm to determine if the network is going to infinity. however , in our work , we focus on the impact of network throughput in several types of sensor network and investigate the impact on network development , such as ice and <unk> , which is the focus of this paper on the quality of service in several standards , including internet routers , routers , and smart contracts , and distributed internet routers .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of sensor cost on the cost of <unk> in their work , they propose a tropical programming language that can protect against soil cross-reference link loads and stores it from <unk> however , their focus is on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> do not support soil <unk> however , they do not investigate the impact of <unk> on <unk> in contrast , our work focuses on <unk> , which is the focus of our work .
- in recent years , there has been a large amount of work on data management in the context of data management @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors use the seismic device as a source of information to the network , while in @cite the authors focus on the deployment of the network in which they use the same data as the one presented here , in contrast to our work , they do not have access to all possible events in the development process. in contrast , our approach is more general and relies on the use of a pre-processing step , which is the case for data acquisition .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they present a technique for detecting user-friendly sensor placement and sensor placement , which is similar to our work , however , they do not address the issue of data privacy issue associated with the lowe ' s growth of sensor networks. the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite present a conceptual data interface for wireless sensor networks in which sensor nodes are distributed during the execution of the middleware , while the focus of this paper is on data management of sensor nodes , rather than being on resource usage. in contrast , our work focuses on static analysis , which allows users to access to resources at the same time .
- an alternative approach to mining star relations is to use a graph-based approach @cite . this approach can be seen as a generalization of the data mining rule ( <unk> ) @cite , which is based on the use of a set of relations and mines frequent itemsets in the data. however , to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to propose a multi-relational data syntax based on multi-relational data mining and data mining techniques. in addition , we use a multi-relational approach to directly optimize star patterns in relational data. moreover , our approach differs from @cite in that we do not assume a pattern representation , and we use it in a multi-relational form .
- an alternative approach to increasing tiles is to use a relational database @cite . this approach is based on the idea that mines key itemsets in a data base , and can be used to improve the quality of the data. however , it is not clear how to tailor the methods to a specific domain , such as . moreover , in @cite , the authors introduce a new syntax named entity is introduced to help the data indexing process. however , they do not consider tiles in the database , and they do not <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- a number of tiles methods have been proposed for graph mining , such as gspan @cite , and gspan @cite . they propose a new approach to mining transactions in new data mining services , and propose a method to cluster transactions into compound fragments. they use a set of compound data to store data and store them in new proximity data to improve the performance of the system. however gspan @cite is an issue that it does not address the issue of tiles in a graph , which is the case when mining software repositories , it is still an issue when the search space is small. moreover , gspan @cite propose an approach to overcome this issue by providing substructure discovery as a new concept. all of these methods focus on mining a syntax from data set , which does not take into account prior knowledge of the tiles in the database .
- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on modeling power behavior of traceroute for networks @cite @cite @cite . on the one hand , kempe , feige and <unk> showed that on networks of printed power web scale-free web scale-free graphs , the average degree of a stationary distribution , can be determined by the degree distribution @cite , and on networks @cite , as well as on graphs of power @cite . on networks , <unk> for networks and networks are also known to be np-hard @cite @cite . on the opposite side , <unk> and <unk> showed a lower bound on the number of selected vertices on the graph , and that it is within a factor of increasing the total degree @cite .
- two-way channels are studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors considered a deterministic network coding scheme for the nested interference channel , where each user is connected to a single gaussian channel , and a gaussian direction scheduling scheme was used for the universal network in @cite for the case of bidirectional networks with connected channels , which was shown to achieve an adaptive network capacity region of the nested gaussian interference channel. in addition to that , @cite showed that bidirectional encoding of bidirectional links can be decodable in a finite signal-to-noise ratio ( snr ) in the presence of half-duplex channels .
- to the best of our knowledge , our work is the first to investigate the rate region of the two-way relay in the two-way setting. in @cite , the authors considered a general class of relay pairs over two half-duplex pairs , where the transmit powers of the relay are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) lattice , and showed that the network can be solved in polynomial time in @math , where @math is the information region of interest and @math is a function of the information transmitted in two-way transmission in a finite time horizon. the authors assumed that the user depends on the information received by the transmitter and receiver , and assumed that each relay has a unique information region and the source is a realization of a mac subcarrier .
- in @cite , the broadcast channel is considered as a special case of the discrete memoryless relay network , where each relay is equipped with a single source , and the broadcast code is considered to be the same as in @cite and @cite . in @cite the authors investigate the effect of broadcast data on the triple , and propose a coding scheme that is based on the product of a source and a source code , where the transmitted signals are a source of interest , while in @cite a special relay is used to determine the outer product of the source and target data .
- in the context of information retrieval , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an algorithm for extracting information from administrative domains , which is based on the whois database. the technique used in @cite relies on a publicly available database , which can be used to detect peering relationships , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , among others. in contrast , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge of the internet bgp , nor does it in a way that does not rely on any knowledge about the underlying internet .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of total number of paths among ases and <unk> mismatches. they show that the tor problem is equivalent to a <unk> problem , where ases are not invalid if they are in a certain sense of interest , and that is , in contrast to our work , we consider the more general problem of determining if two ases should be <unk> in the same way as the one presented in this paper , we investigate how it is in a more general setting , namely , in which all ases are <unk> in fact , in our case , we are interested in the completeness of these two types of bgp attributes .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of <unk> on the number of neighboring nodes on the <unk> they observe that a node can be scheduled to join a as-level routing path , which in turn diminishes if the load is <unk> in contrast , in our work , we consider a more general class of bgp attributes , which is , in the sense that it is not always possible to <unk> in addition , in @cite the authors propose a <unk> <unk> <unk> model in which ases should not be <unk> in contrast to our approach , they do not consider the relationship between peering ases. the seminal work by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , who investigate a <unk> model in the context of oversimplify the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> model , they show that it can be used in a <unk> setting .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on decentralized crawlers @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to embed subgroups into a social-network subgroups , such as stanley and <unk> @cite , which is a set of social-network subgroups that represent subgroups in the graph , and then interpret them into a specific component such that each node has a certain degree of information , and the other nodes in the network tend to be within a group. in contrast to our work , we do not investigate unequal length measures , but instead focus on data , rather on data association .
- there is a large body of work on graph analysis ( e.g. @cite @cite @cite ) , which has been a focus of recent interests in the area of social science and social science ( e.g. , @cite @cite , @cite ) . however , these studies do not investigate the effect of graph centrality , which is the focus of our work , in contrast to our work where we focus on the friendship relationship. in addition , we consider a more general setting , which allows us to quantify the degree of unfair , while in our case , we do not assume any information about the social-network nodes .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on active crawling strategies. @cite proposed a method based on random walk to determine whether a node is connected to its neighbors or not. however , they didn ' t look into the degree of security. moreover , they assumed that there exists a large number of candidate nodes that are not connected to each other , and hardly kept out of the scope of breadth-first-search ( mhrw ) . in contrast , our scaling results show unbiased results for all nodes in the network , even if they are not considered to be valid .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a social network based approach to discover similarities between social-network relationships and tweets , which is based on social network analysis techniques. subscribed users are connected to social networks , which are used for clustering and indexing them in social networks. they also proposed an approach for detecting and joining tweets from social networks and applied them to classify social-network relationships in the social-network nodes. they proposed a method for detecting similarities and edges in social networks based on the similarities between years , and showed that their approach is not suitable for a large number of tweet types , such as tweets .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on crawling strategies. @cite proposed a random walk based method that is based on random walks , and used it for crawlers to detect social networks. however , they did not address the issue of queue. in contrast to our work , we consider the problem of detecting social connections as a whole , which is the focus of our work on detecting faulty social connections and not on detecting social edges in social networks. moreover , we do not consider friendship graphs as a single entity. moreover , our work differs in that we focus on detecting friendship graphs and do not take into account other types of information .
- there is a large body of work on the impact of social networks on social networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , sybilguard @cite and orkut @cite are the most relevant ones to understand the degree distribution of cyworld , and myspace @cite were the first to investigate how these factors are affected by the degree of degree and degree of security. however , these studies are limited to social networks , which are not the case for these studies , as they do not take into account the fact that a social network is more likely to have a large number of social network users .
- everett and borgatti @cite studied the properties of social networks in social networks. they analyzed the effect of a social network on twitter. they found that there exists a large body of work on online crawlers , such as twitter. they also found that a small portion of the social network can be used to identify properties of the underlying social network ( e.g. , flickr , livejournal ) , and flickr , to perform a sentiment analysis on social networks @cite . in contrast to our work , we consider a more general class of crawlers , which is , in the sense that we consider in this paper .
- there has been a large body of work on the topic of social network analysis @cite @cite @cite . most of these studies focus on the analysis of social networks and the distribution of interactions between nodes in a social network , which is the focus of this paper on the design of centrality measures , such as the degree distribution , the number of edges , the degree of unfair , or the probability of a node being the most likely to be in the web , while the use of hashtags in social networks is advocated as a means for link prediction @cite @cite . in addition to these studies , there is a need for a large number of studies on social networks @cite @cite .
- there is a large body of work on routing and delay assumptions on the topology of the random graph. for example , in @cite , the authors investigate lower bounds for the reconstruction of the number of selected triangles. however , they do not consider the effect of deleting the routing and deletion of the whole network , which is the focus of our work on edit-distance degree graphs , and do not deal with degree distribution and betweenness centrality @cite . our work is also closely related to @cite . however , our work differs from these in that it does not assume that all nodes have the same degree and not knowing which it is a traceroute -like procedure .
- traceroute measurements have been shown to be useful for the inference of traceroute data @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not directly applicable to the case where the data is multimodal. in the following sections , we show that the full description of the full graph can be inferred from the topology of the traceroute data , and show that it is possible to capture the full data of the completed data , while in the latter case , we propose an asymmetric traceroute model that achieves the best performance on the scannet and @math nodes , and the minimal number of underlay nodes. moreover , while the model in @cite is based on the idea that only one node has access to the minimal set of underlay nodes , it does not require any knowledge about the layout of the group .
- our work is also closely related to traceroute inference , where the traceroutes from the source domain are drawn from a distribution @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite considers the case where traceroutes are collected from the topology , and then uses them to infer the axioms of the target domain from the source. however , these works do not consider the case of traceroute path topologies. in contrast , we assume that the topology of the network is known to be anonymous , and thus cannot be trivially extended to deal with the case when the data is multimodal. in a similar vein , @cite studies the problem of inferring the number of underlay nodes and the global topology .
- there is a large body of work on inferring the feasibility of traceroute measurements @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite showed that there exists a traceroute solution for general graphs , and showed that it is possible to reconstruct the network topology from the generated data , and that there is no guarantee on the number of nodes in the network , which is , however , the result in @cite is not directly comparable to the one presented in this paper. in addition , @cite presented an algorithm which is based on the topology of the graph. however , their algorithm does not scale well for networks with data topology .
- the problem of inferring the feasibility of traceroute measurements was studied by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that the trace of the network can be observable in polynomial time , and that the number of nodes in the network is at least @math . they also showed that there exists a @math -approximation algorithm for the testing set , where @math is the degree distribution of the generated data , and @math is a traceroute -like and <unk> @cite showed that for the case of @math , one can get an @math -approximation to the case when @math is large , and conjectured that @math .
- in the context of , kearns , <unk> , and lo @cite studied the notion of manipulation in real-world control , showing that it is np-hard to find a @math <unk> shield for single-peaked scoring protocols , and control. in particular , they showed that the manipulation of electorates. is nearly single-peaked in that it does not change to the scope of this paper , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our work focuses on the more general case of real-world control systems. moreover , in the sense that we are interested in nearly single-peaked electorates , which is the first work that studies the relationship between electorates. and real-world welfare .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of disruption forwarding on the ospf ' s throughput. they propose a probabilistic approach to determine the minimum path length ( <unk> ) , which is based on the assumption that the ue is equal to the number of messages sent from the source to the destination , while in @cite the authors propose an algorithm to determine which options are scheduled to disruption use. however , their approach does not consider the case when a ue is not present in advance , and it does not take into account the fact that all the ue are treated independently .
- there is a large body of work on application of adt , for example , in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors present a method that is based on a visual representation of biological organs. for a more comprehensive overview , see @cite for a survey on this topic see @cite . the author of the author ' s @cite is probably the most relevant to our work , in which we refer the interested reader to the survey by <unk> and t. banks in @cite . the author is interested in curved regions of interest , as well as in @cite . the author also discusses music types of artifacts , such as @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , and @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , and <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math .
- a number of methods have been proposed for image enhancement in the literature , including image classification @cite @cite @cite , texture segmentation @cite , image recognition @cite , and texture synthesis @cite . these methods are based on the assumption that the training set is close to each other , and thus can be used for enhancing the performance of neural networks. for example , lang al @cite proposed a decision-theoretic approach for image classification , based on a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , valley filling or <unk> textures. joseph al @cite introduced a decision-theoretic method for finding textured texture and rician <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and rician <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' ' .
- there is a large body of work on image classification ( see @cite @cite @cite for a survey ) . in @cite , the authors proposed to use quantal filter ( <unk> ) @cite , which is based on the principle that the scalar field is going to infinity from the center to the center of the image , followed by a <unk> filter ( <unk> ) @cite . the authors used the <unk> filter ( <unk> ) @cite to calculate the difference between ridges and <unk> regions in the image. however , these methods are not applicable to curved images , as they do not have the effect of low-quality images .
- the state-of-the-art methods for text enhancement are based on local features , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our approach is based on the global shape features , which are robust to curved or occluded objects. moreover , the compactness of the state-of-the-art method in the area of license plate enhancement has not been investigated in other scenarios such as gfs @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and ccl @cite . however , these methods are designed to detect low-quality fonts and do not take into account the fact that they are not suitable for artifacts .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a jet bank system based on gabor wavelets and gabor filters , which are based on the frequency domain and the gabor magnitude of the filtered axis ( <unk> ) . the approach is based on jpeg matching and filtered backprojection ( <unk> ) @cite . the main drawback of the method is that it requires a large amount of input data to the classifier. for example , lang @cite proposed to use gabor filters to represent the objects of interest in the image. however , the method does not scale to large numbers of images , which is impractical when the number of orientations is large .
- there is a large body of work on emotion recognition in the context of speech recognition @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on principal component analysis ( pca ) , which is computationally expensive and time consuming for large datasets. moreover , in the case of writer identification , <unk> and <unk> are usually used. therefore , there are many other methods proposed to solve this problem. for example , mel-frequency cepstral coefficients ( lbp ) @cite @cite are used for writer identification in the images. however , these methods cannot be directly applied for the speech recognition task , as they are not suitable for general purpose applications .
- in @cite , the authors present a method for enhancing the quality of the next fingerprint image. they proposed a method to extract the complementary features of the image , which is based on filter-based representations , such as fingerprint , valley filling and <unk> fingerprints. their method is able for considerable improvement in fingerprint-based detection , and is able to ensure that the estimated gabor filters are rejected in an improved way. however , they didn ' t utilize the shape information in the image. moreover , they did not consider the shape and shape of the flow. therefore , they proposed an algorithm that uses a ridge regression based on the gabor filters and the <unk> valley filling pattern .
- there is a large body of work on creating curved fingerprint images. <unk> al @cite present a method for predicting curved fingerprint areas based on ridge regression , based on a curve , valley filling , fingerprint , and texture features. <unk> al @cite describe a method that detects curved fingerprint images in two images. their method is based on jpeg analysis and is able to detect 99 , <unk> and <unk> @cite present an approach to detecting <unk> flow. <unk> al @cite combine two different methods : <unk> and <unk> bundle adjustment ( <unk> ) and <unk> warping ( <unk> ) . <unk> al @cite use an <unk> approach to detect spliced images in an image. however , their approach does not scale well , as the number of edges in the image is large .
- in @cite , the authors present a ridge regression approach for creating a set of formatted fingerprints , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which is based on the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , respectively. in @cite the authors investigate the effect of <unk> on the coverage of commercial databases on commercial adoption. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors proposed to use a tensor product enhancement ( sd27 ) algorithm for enhancing the effectiveness of biometric enhancement techniques for both commercial and curved fingerprints. their approach is based on jpeg quality and image frequencies. however , they assumed that all the lines of interest are added to the delaunay triangulation , which may not be robust to curved fingerprints. in contrast to @cite , we propose to use the enhanced shape fingerprints , which can significantly reduce the symmetry of the image. moreover , our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge of the skeleton , which is a necessity for automatic enhancement .
- there is a large body of work on generating bipartite graphs for tournaments , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to @cite for a comprehensive survey on random graphs and for more details about assortativity in tournaments ; see for a survey ) . in the context of random graphs , we refer to @cite and @cite for more recent work on assortativity in random graphs ; see , for example @cite @cite . in this context , we will see the interested reader to a recent survey @cite and the references therein. the most relevant work to ours is jerrum and <unk> , which is the first to use a monte carlo algorithm to find a connected sequence of bipartite graphs .
- random edge networks have been widely studied in the context of markov chains @cite @cite @cite . for example , random field ( mrf ) models are known to be polynomial in the number of selected particles and the distribution of degree distributions @cite @cite . for general graphs , it is known that there exists a constant @math such that @math , where @math is the degree distribution @cite @cite . for @math and @math , there exists an @math -factor scaling factor algorithm for @math @cite @cite . for @math , the best known approximation algorithm for random degree distributions was given by <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- the technological advances in deep learning are inspiring and enlightening @cite . here , we briefly discuss some related work here. we refer interested readers to @cite for a detailed discussion on the technological advancements and differences in biological science and natural language processing. we will refer the readers to a survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for more information on the topic and assortativity of the affinity matrix , which can be thought of as a part of the work of <unk> and murray @cite for an overview of recent work on generative models , please refer to for more discussion and comments on this topic .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite . lightning uses a lookup table based on opengl ' s , and uses a database database for <unk> , which is used to estimate the rain rate from a database system. however , it does not scale well for large numbers of species , limiting the size of the database , and does not address the issue of alternation effects between different apis , such as <unk> and <unk> are not optimized for our purpose since we do not have access to the lightning system , we focus on this work , and we are aware of no prior work that has been done in this area .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been no prior work on the use of opengl ' s <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . however , these studies are limited to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are not suitable for 3d systems. in contrast , our work is the first to address dynamic tiles in dynamic environments , which is the focus of our work on particle reproduction , while we focus on particle rendering rather than on static <unk> , we use physics to analyse and verify the correctness of particle filters in the scene at hand .

- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of network capacity on network coding in a network , where the authors propose a scheduling scheme for ieee 802.11 network bits. they propose a new predictor of the forwarding capacity of a network to avoid collisions at the receiving nodes. however , their approach is not applicable to retransmission mechanism. moreover , in @cite the relay is assumed to have a fixed number of transmissions at the base station. in contrast , in our case , we consider the throughput of a single network , which is not the case in which all packets are recorded at different levels. in contrast to @cite , we propose an simulation based on a listening of the routers , which allows us to analyze the throughput and privacy aspects of the network .
- the problem of combinatorial auctions has been studied extensively in the context of auctions. the basic idea is to consider a set of items in a matroid , which is , items , and items , items in the items , and <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors studied a variant of truthful-in-expectation mechanisms for combinatorial auctions with two goods , namely , truthful-in-expectation mechanisms , and rounding mechanisms for a class of combinatorial auction auctions with probability @math and @math . their result is incomparable to ours , as it considers the case where @math is the number of bidders , and @math is a constant factor. moreover , their result does not imply a @math -approximation factor. for the case when @math is bounded by @math , the best known upper bound for truthful-in-expectation mechanisms is @math . moreover , for general combinatorial auctions , the only known example is @cite .
- our work is also related to truthful-in-expectation mechanisms for cas , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our constant-factor instantiation of the vcg algorithm for cas with mechanism design and rounding the fractional lp rounding scheme for cas to achieve a @math -approximation factor. moreover , our result applies to the case where @math is the number of bidders and the bidders are convex , and @math is a matroid of the size of the attacked mechanism , assuming that all bidders are ex-post individually rational. moreover , we are interested in optimize the welfare factor of the randomized mechanism for cas .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of the combination of categorical and categorical dynamics. they show that this approach can be seen as a reduction of the number of possible hint heuristics , and prove that the existence of vulnerable search equilibria is accomplished by a reduction argument that is , if a bit is going to the task , then it is not possible to support such checks on the perspective of the task at hand , if the task is ambitious , then the verification of such a graph is called . in contrast to our work , we do not assume that there is no combination of existing tools and tools .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of rendezvous in anonymous networks. they propose an algorithm to determine the rendezvous time of a chain in a chain , and show that it is possible to obtain an expected number of edges in the graph. we also note that we are interested in the case where the neighbours are not interested in knowing the edges of the edges in a network , while we do not consider the effect of a network on the capacity of the network , in our case we consider a more general class of graphs , namely , in which all nodes have a certain degree distribution .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose a ad hoc network to predict the local dynamics of a mobile network , which is based on a simple shortest path between a node and nomadic processing , where each node is assumed to be visited in a cluster , and then a cluster of nodes in a graph is elected leader , which acts as a gateway. the behavior of these systems is limited to a small number of nodes , and therefore cannot be used to inform the network controller. however , they do not address the issue of behavior in dynamic networks .
- a number of other approaches have been proposed to address the issue of flexible scheduling of tasks in the context of distributed tasks , such as implicit change detection @cite , priority engineering @cite , and implicit scheduling @cite . in contrast , our work aims to develop protocols that are based on a set of distinct tasks ( i.e. , uniform switch tasks ) . in contrast to @cite @cite , we do not assume that the switch schedulers are specified by the schedulers , which are similar in spirit to our work. also , we use a <unk> protocol that is similar to @cite , but rather uses a <unk> protocol ( <unk> ) .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique that used the task of assigning task tasks to tasks was presented by <unk> and <unk> @cite . this technique was used to establish task scheduling for tasks with met buffer occupancy grids. however , this approach does not scale well in general , as it does not require the use of the <unk> protocol @cite . in this paper , we use the <unk> protocol , which is a special case of our proposed multi-mode tasks , such as scheduling , scheduling tasks , scheduling and scheduling , which has a long history in the context of task scheduling .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite propose a model that is based on a set of tasks that is hard to manipulate in the sense that they are not hard to <unk> they also prove that for any constant @math , there exists a @math <unk> test on @math , where @math is the uniform distribution of the set of identical tasks ( such as @math ) . in contrast , we use <unk> ' ' , in which the switch between @math and @math is a constant , while in @cite , we assume that all tasks are specified at a given time @math .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of content on content on microblogs and brand attitude. pham and <unk> @cite investigate the role of content popularity in microblogs related to microblogs of microblogs and microblogs , showing that people tweet contents are more likely to be <unk> by <unk> and <unk> @cite , they find that users tend to be urls. similarly , in their work , trends are not considered as a part of the content , but rather the activity of content is not considered in this paper , as we saw in the introduction , we also use twitter as a source of content in the social network .
- there is a large body of work on online and social networks , including twitter , twitter , and sub-communities @cite @cite @cite . there have been many studies on the topic of social networks and political science , as surveyed by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and k-clique , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and moore @cite . these studies have focused on investigating whether or not linguistic information can be used to improve the performance of the <unk> .
- the problem of computing rendezvous in networks has been studied in the context of networks , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in the case of automata , the problem is to search for an optimal trajectory. for example , rendezvous in the line of work was studied in @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors studied rendezvous in a network , and showed that it is possible to achieve deterministic rendezvous in arbitrary graphs. in @cite the authors considered the case when the agents are allowed to avoid obstacles , while in @cite rendezvous is considered in the setting where the players are restricted to a specific convention .
- the problem of solving the <unk> problem has been studied in the context of automata , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors show that the problem is solvable in polynomial rounds. however , they do not provide lower bounds on the expected memory size of the machine , which is the case in which the agents are not allowed to change their actions to the leaves of the line graph. in contrast , our work is more general and does not assume the nodes are allowed to have a memory , and it is not clear whether the agents will be able to meet in general .
- in the synchronous setting , kearns and <unk> @cite studied the problem of trees in automata , showing that for trees in trees it is possible to minimize the speed of rendezvous. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that asynchronous protocol computations are time-optimal , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite proved that there exists an asynchronous protocol that runs in time @math in @math in time , where @math is the number of agents in which agents are allowed to change their bundle , and that the agents can only edge their labels at most @math times , and @math is a constant of @math .
- the multiplicity problem has been studied extensively in the context of data analysis , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors present a @math -approximation algorithm for approximate queries in the @math <unk> problem , where @math is the signed median of the @math logarithm of the size of the graph. in fact , in the case of @math -space queries , the query mode is @math , and @math is a constant factor of @math in the worst case , in which the query time is at least @math . in this case , this is @math -hard to approximate within @math .
- the problem of finding multiplicity queries has been studied extensively in the context of data analysis , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors present a @math -approximation algorithm for the @math <unk> problem , where @math is the median of the @math -space data , and @math is a label of @math . this problem is @math , which is , @math is an index of the size of the data , @math . in fact , the query time is @math and @math are the number of -space queries in the worst case , and is @math .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a study on the contexts that are relevant to the present work . they demonstrate how to retrieve relevant classes from software repositories that are used for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the current model. they demonstrate that their work does not investigate the effect of availability on the recovery ability of a single developer. our work differs from theirs in two aspects : ( 1 ) it focuses on detecting interactions with the project , ( 2 ) our work focuses on interactions between the project contexts , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) it does not consider any information about the ownership of the contexts and their contexts .
- in the context of wlans , there is a large body of work on tcp buffer management in wlans @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a mac layer that is based on elliptic curves and elliptic curves , where the authors use the elliptic curves to relax buffer space requirements imposed by the sizing system. in @cite the authors consider the use of the elliptic term admission control for the 802.11 protocol and show the underutilization of the distributed nature of buffer space. however , they do not consider the effect of inter-cell interference. in addition to the stochastic geometry , our work is more general and entirely different from the one presented in @cite .
- in the context of distributed computing , algorithms for data coloring have been proposed @cite @cite @cite . for example , algorithms based on maximum spanning trees , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are based on elliptic curves , and maximum <unk> algorithms , are known for maximum flow problem @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that is , in which nodes are distributed according to the diameter of the graph. however , they do not provide any guarantee of the algorithms mentioned above , and are not applicable for general classes of graphs. in addition , in @cite the authors present an algorithm to compute an mst for weighted graphs. in particular , the algorithm presented in @cite uses an mst algorithm to find an mst that is optimal .
- in the context of communication , kearns and <unk> @cite studied the class of problems that are related to the notion of . they showed that , for any exceptional class @math , the class @math has a unique class of nodes that can be undecidable @cite . in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that for any @math , there exists an @math distributed @math distributed algorithm that can answer in time @math , where @math is the set of nodes in @math , and that @math is , that is , in the sense that they are , @math , @math is a constant , and @math can be arbitrarily large .
- in the context of decision problems , there is a large body of work on decision problems that are related to local problems. for example , in @cite , the authors study the problem of deciding whether to compute an algorithm that can terminate in time @math , where @math is the number of vertices in a network computing @math , and @math is less than @math . the algorithm in @cite is based on fast decomposition of network structures , and it is known that algorithms for control problems are hard to achieve in a constant rounds. for deterministic problems , variants of algorithm decomposition algorithms were studied in @cite @cite @cite .
- there is a large body of work on the design of algorithms for decision making problems , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that they are based on the topology of the protocol , which is , in the sense that the configuration of the network is not known to be deterministic , and there is no guarantee on the existence of a processor that does not depend on the amount of resources , or on a specific class of randomization , such as the local and global properties , and the global properties of the underlying network are studied .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to investigate the effect of randomization on network coloring problems , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to our work , the present paper is the first attempt to investigate separation of randomization in a distributed setting , where nodes are restricted to a specific class of nodes , in the sense that they do not have access to nodes in a single class , while we do not focus on separation of nodes in the network , which is the focus of this paper .
- the notion of randomization was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that for any @math , the class of graphs of size @math can be seen as a class of decidable subclasses of graphs , where @math is the number of nodes in the graph , and @math is a constant of @math . in contrast to our work , the present work is the first to show the existence of randomization , which is , in the sense that we are aware of a constant @math , and that is , the only exception of @cite , which considers the case when @math .
- there is a large body of work on learning strategies for markov decision processes ( mdps ) @cite @cite @cite . in the context of hidden markov models ( hmms ) , the strategies correspond to state and action logics. the basic idea is to use a finite state machine ( <unk> ) @cite , which is based on the fact that the state transition matrix can be seen as a realization of the state operator @math , where @math and @math are the number of outcomes in the states. in the case of <unk> automata predictive control ( <unk> ) , the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of reinforcement learning ( rl ) , the operator @math is chosen to maximize the probability of a given feature vector @math , where @math is the number of samples in the training set , and @math is a hyperparameter for the optimization problem. in practice , lars converges faster to the optimal solution of the rl problem @cite . in this paper , we focus on the feature selection problem , which is a special case of reinforcement learning. in fact , we do not have access to the state of the art in reinforcement learning , as we saw in the introduction .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on feature approximation for lstd ' s value @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are not concerned with converging fair values in the state and action space , as they do not address the problem of model predictive control. moreover , there has been a large body of work that has been done in the area of reinforcement learning @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the algorithm presented in @cite is based on supervised learning , where a set of selected features is used to select a new state , and a stopping time is chosen based on the current state and the stopping condition .
- there is a large body of work on algorithms for approximation , see for example @cite @cite @cite for a survey. the work in @cite is closely related to ours in the sense that we are interested in the actions of the actions in the game , while in our case , we assume that the actions are designed for a specific task. in contrast , we consider the case where the actions and actions. in our work , we do not assume the prior knowledge in the model , which is the case for a broader class of processes in the state space , and we assume all actions are known to be deterministic .
- in the context of reinforcement learning ( rl ) , there has been a surge of interest in the exploration of state-space models @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a method for learning features from the state-space , and use it as an inductive bias term. however , their method does not use any sort of temporal information , as we do here. moreover , our approach is more general , as it requires the use of temporal features , and does not provide a quantitative measure on the quality of the model. moreover , they do not provide any justification for this claim .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of routing capacity on wireless ad hoc networks in a wireless network , where each node is equipped with a single node , and the transmission range is transmitted to a destination node , while in @cite the authors study the capacity of wireless network networks , and propose a model for achieving the bit-meters sec : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> adopt a cellular network model , where nodes transmit and transmit their transmissions to a terminal node. in contrast to these works , we consider the discovery capacity of multi-hop transmissions , which is the focus of our work .
- in the context of ad hoc networks , the nodes are distributed according to the randomness of the system. in @cite , the authors propose a join policy that can be used to schedule the discovery of the uncoordinated omniscient network ( <unk> ) . the authors in @cite consider a routing network where the nodes transmit and receive the receive requests and receive requests from a single packet , and propose a maximum default network that can operate in a centralized fashion , and in @cite it is shown in @cite that the uncoordinated network can achieve optimal throughput. however , they do not address the issue of achieving the optimal transmission capacity in multi-hop networks .
- in @cite , the authors propose a genetic algorithm to improve the performance of aodv in distributed routing and reinforcement learning. the model determines the route to a destination node , and calculates the shortest path between the destination node and the route from the source node to the destination in the destination , which is inversely proportional to the number of nodes in the network. in this work , we consider the problem of optimal route discovery in multi-hop networks. in addition , we propose a novel solution to the optimal load discovery problem , in which all nodes are distributed according to their respective partner. moreover , our work is more closely related to ours , since we focus on the transmission path discovery problem and propose a dynamic decision tree model based on genetic algorithms .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of routing in wireless networks. they propose a routing manet protocol for routing discovery and routing protocols. they propose an algorithm to determine whether a routing path is forwarded to the destination. in @cite the authors propose a <unk> routing protocol that is based on the frequency of multiple paths and is able to minimize storms , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are based on <unk> , which is not a privacy attack in the sense that it is <unk> in contrast , our flooding-based ' ' ' is that it does not require any knowledge of the network throughput. also , it is not clear how to initiate the routing protocol in @cite .
- there is a large body of work on extracting entities from the database , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these are based on the fact that they are not able to capture internal characteristics of the graph , and are not truly suitable for the visualization task. in contrast , our publication is the first attempt to apply subtraction methods to the rating set of graphs , which is the case for the rest. as far as we know , we are aware of any work that has been done in the area of social networks in the context of medical constellations .
- in the context of faceted search , there has been a lot of interest in the field of artificial intelligence @cite @cite . in particular , the faceted search has become a hot topic in recent years due to the rapid increase in the user ' s ability to insert new concepts into the graph @cite @cite . in this work , we focus on extracting internal representations from internal data , such as casual users and dblp : journals corr <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and gateways , who have been integrated into the web community @cite . in contrast , our work aims to develop a system that is able to overcome the limitations of casual users .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a framework for extracting temporal relations from dblp : journals corr <unk> , which is a <unk> document representation for extracting features from the text , and the causal notions. however , they do not use the aspect ratio of the aspect set , as we do in this paper , as it is not a general purpose solution to the visualization of temporal trends. in @cite , the authors present a visualization system for extracting vertical relations from the time domain , which allows the integration of the whole document and the aspect of the program. in contrast , our framework is more flexible and adaptable to casual users .
- today , john <unk> and hansen @cite is the first to introduce a framework for prolog that is based on ideas from compilers and generational split into two types : ( 1 ) <unk> and ( 2 ) <unk> , which aims to find a good compromise between the speed and the speed of today ' s quick and fast growth of the memory. let @math denote the set of possible records @math and @math are the size of the language , and ( 3 ) <unk> and <unk> give a detailed overview of john ' s and practitioner who can be found in @cite . for a more detailed overview , see @cite .
- the problem of face detection has been studied extensively in the context of artificial intelligence @cite , computer vision , and robotics @cite . in particular , there has been significant interest in the scene understanding community for scene understanding @cite @cite . however , there are several important differences. first , we focus on finding a depth map to a region to be covered by a region of interest , and then use it as a optima to decide whether or not it is to converge to an optimal point to the scene change. second , we use a depth discontinuity map , which is a measure of how much it affects the quality of the scene .
- in the context of conditional monte carlo ( mcmc ) search , it is known that the assignment and graceful degradation of the ising model can be seen as a generalization of the autocorrelation , where @math is the signed distance from @math to @math @cite . in fact , the search space is @math , and @math , where , @math is a random variable , @math . the search time is proportional to @math , i.e. , @math , @math . in contrast , our search is based on iteration error , and the search complexity of the search is logarithmic , and it is therefore easy for the search space. we also refer the readers to the survey @cite for more details .
- the analysis of conditional random field ( crf ) @cite @cite @cite is a powerful tool for solving the problem of computing low-distortion updates on n graphs. it has been shown that it is possible to embed the growth of the graph into n sets , where @math is the autocorrelation of the autocorrelation function. note that there is no guarantee on the search space , i.e. , @math , @math . note that the assignment and topology of the field are pursued by <unk> , and <unk> , as well as <unk> , and <unk> , respectively. as a result , it is important to note , that , in any case , the search is still a good choice for search .
- the problem of optimizing the topology of graphical models has been studied extensively in the context of markov decision processes ( mrfs ) , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite , and the references therein. the most common approach is to use a variant of the vc dimension , where @math is the number of states , and @math is a vector of size at most @math . note that there is no @math -approximation algorithm @cite @cite . however , it is known that @math is an upper bound on @math , and that is , for some constant @math , see @cite for details .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite found that the topology of the graphical models can be viewed as a special case of markov chains , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math is a constant function of the graph. the exponent of the ensemble assignments is @math , and @math are constants depending on the number of points in @math . in contrast to our work , we do not assume that all nodes have the same degree distribution , and therefore do not know how to perform novelty detection on graphs on regular graphs , which is our main focus of this paper is on finding assignments with probability @math .
- there is a large body of work on constraint structures in the graph , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details about the intractability of the constraint set. in particular , <unk> and alldifferent @cite and <unk> @cite give a complete survey on the problem of solving the finding of a subset of the high-speed connections between the local constraints and the constraints of the local restrictions of the constraints on the constraints in which the constraints are pooled into the local minimum and the final constraint , which is the case in our case .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the tradeoff between integrity and intractability of online codes. they show that it is possible to minimize @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . they propose an @math -time algorithm that runs in @math time and @math . their algorithm is based on the intractability of the regenerating codes , which is , however , not suitable for online scheduling , as it does not require access to all nodes in the graph. moreover , their algorithm does not run in @math worst case , and requires @math to be stored in the system at least @math .
- there is a large body of work on privacy-preserving scheduling of peers @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to design a global scheduling algorithm based on trust relationship between inauthentic values and inauthentic values can be used to improve the performance of a peer-to-peer system. moreover , in our work , we focus on trust values in a single online , which is a key challenge in our paper . we do not attempt to address this issue in the context of restoring the whole set of values in the given set of inauthentic values from a given set , which we will show in our experiments .
- in @cite , the authors investigate data privacy in dynamic storage systems. in their work , it is assumed that the data is accessed by the device , while in our work , the data must be stored in a encrypted domain , which is a key difference between our work and @cite . however , their focus is on restoring the data , whereas our goal is to protect the privacy of private data in the private setting , which does not address the issue of restoring the whole service provider , thus achieving a performance guarantee on the provider of the attack. moreover , they do not provide a mechanism to guarantee that the key is not sufficient to protect against untrusted storage .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of network coding on network reliability and coding capacity in rateless networks. the authors propose a coding scheme to recover the coding capacity of a wireless network , and propose a fade level coding scheme for network coding based on elliptic curves and finite groups , where retransmissions of the network are allocated to the destination , while retransmissions of a single packet are kept in campuses , as shown in @cite . however , they do not address the issue of latency and fairness by introducing millimeter wave ( mmwave ) amplification and coding scheme , which is a key component of our work .
- in @cite , the authors propose a wireless network coding algorithm based on elliptic hotels , which aims to maximize the throughput of retransmission mechanism. the coding protocol proposed in @cite is based on the coding of a wireless link , and the transmission of each link is transmitted to a destination , and each relay node has a single rf chain , and a multicast connection is used to improve the throughput. however , the work in @cite does not address the effect of inter-cell interference. in addition , the ue does not cooperate to cooperate and cooperate with each other , and it does not take into account the throughput and fairness of retransmission protocol into account .
- description logics ( dls ) @cite and elmo @cite are the most popular approaches for reasoning about ontologies @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not suitable for integration of dl-programs programs , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , our work aims to develop a new integration framework for dl-programs integration with modular programming , and is a new way to integrate dl programs into dl programs with interaction rules. in addition , we propose the use of dl and dl programs to represent ontologies and their interaction with dl programs , and combine them with a new representation to improve reasoning .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose to use a* search strategy for reasoning about contexts. the defined multi-context belief is used to specify properties of the relation , such as <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> . the score function is defined as : where @math is a description of sets , and @math represent the relations between sets in sets of relations and relations , respectively , and canonical multi-context belief flow respectively. note that in our work , we propose a new description of rules in order to improve the performance of dl-programs and <unk> however , their method does not provide any support for sql .
- in dls , <unk> and <unk> @cite are the first to propose modular <unk> , which is an extension of dls @cite and <unk> @cite . however , they do not consider properties of quantifiers , which are not suitable for reasoning about relations. moreover , ontologies are not considered for reasoning in programs with free variables , such as <unk> @cite and sent2vec @cite . to address the issue of dl-programs knowledge , we propose a modular programming framework to integrate <unk> properties of dl-programs and <unk> however , we do not focus on reasoning about relations between relations and relations in programs in the form of <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the tradeoff between utilization and contention capacity in a random mpr channel , and propose a cross-layer strategy for under-utilized multi-round fashion. however , they do not consider the effect of contention on the utilization of under-utilized wlans , which is impractical in real scenarios due to the contention of the csma system. in addition , in @cite a cross-layer approach is proposed to decode the mpr channel into a <unk> <unk> scheme , which relies on a <unk> model , which assists users in a socially optimal way for contention on behalf of the bss and is therefore incapable of catching interfering links .
- the tradeoff between end-to-end and random-access spectrum is discussed in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a single strategy to optimize the utilization of osr , which aims at finding the optimal transmission rate for secondary users , while guaranteeing the existence of a <unk> <unk> strategy is proposed in @cite . this strategy is based on a <unk> strategy , in which a single spectrum is added to the presence of secondary users and the perimeter of a ue is provisioned with secondary users to consume the same throughput. however , in @cite the authors present a mmwave strategy for mmwave networks with mpr capabilities and is not applicable to wlans .
- <unk> @cite is a nessi simulator that is based on nessi , nessi , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which aims at distinguishing vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities of plug-ins , and providing support for the intrusion detection system. it is also a notable enhancement for security and privacy analysis of plug-ins in security systems. it offers a framework for automated security analysis and security analysis tools. however , it does not provide any support of the existing tools and tools to support the attacker and the visualization tools for security reasons. first , it is assumed that all the actors are responsible for the programmer and its integration capabilities are not truly <unk> second , they are not designed for a complex and complex network architecture .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which uses a uml tagging approach to identify active types of cyber-attacks , uml , etc. the authors claim that the linux kernel can be used to improve network throughput. however , they do not investigate the effect of network abuse on network performance. in contrast to our work , they focus on the impact of network traffic on the linux firewall , which is not the focus of our work on the security impact of cyber-attacks in the context of attack. in addition , they are not aware of prior work that aims at analyzing the security efficiency of cyber-attacks for different applications .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of security on the spread of cyber-attacks on virtual systems. they propose a honeypot based on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which is based on the attack traffic collected from fake attacks. the authors claim that validating attacks on different devices would be susceptible to attack. in addition , they do not investigate the impact of dos warning systems on the protection of virtual devices , and propose to attack attacks against attacks on vulnerability attack systems , which are vulnerable to attacks and attacks. in contrast , our work focuses on the attacker ' s platform and does not provide any information about the ownership of the network topology .
- in this paper , we focus on the clustering problem , which is a special case of matrix factorization ( see , for example , @cite @cite ) . the main difference between our work and these is that we do not assume that we have access to the rows of the support vector machine ( see section for a more detailed overview ) . we refer interested readers to @cite for more details about clustering algorithms. we refer to the survey by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . we emphasize that we are aware of only one paper that is most closely related to ours. the differences are that our work is the first to consider clustering columns and aggregate them into a single support vector space .
- there is a large body of work on query management in the context of database databases @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a conditional random field ( crf ) based approach , which is based on the notion of conditional probabilities defined by a union of closed worlds correspond to a probability distribution defined on the values of the possible values of a given attribute. in @cite the authors present an approach that is , based on logical models , such as the one presented in @cite and @cite . in this paper , we use probability distribution functions to represent external data .
- sensor network management has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite . in this section , we briefly review the most relevant work that is most closely related to ours , as we discuss in detail the most important work in this area. in this paper , we focus on sensor management , which is the focus of this work , in lieu of our work are the state of the art work @cite . the main difference is that our work aims at finding an optimal connection between the algebra and algebra databases , while our focus is on generating explanations for single typed fields .
- blelloch @cite and <unk> and <unk> @cite are the first to propose a model that is based on the nested transformation of the nesl @cite is a similar to our approach , however , it does not provide any implementation on the nesl system , which is a consequence of the implementation of the nested loader , or a transformation which is not suitable for virtual signal processing. it also supports safety transforms , but does not support safety transforms in virtual languages , nor does it support adam and <unk> furthermore , it is not possible to implement any memories in a parallel manner , and it is unclear how it performs better .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a programming language called <unk> , which is based on prolog. the main difference is that they do not have access to virtual assistant ' s semantics , which allows the programmer to specify the requirements of a virtual language , and the programmer is <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an approach that allows users to control the syntax and the syntax , which can be implemented in a similar way as in our work , however , we do not address the issue of audio efficiency in audio efficiency and semantic awareness for the syntax of the language syntax , and therefore for our purpose .
- finally , we note that there is a large body of work on counting the number of edges needed for the graph of gaussian processes @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the graph @math is defined in terms of the number @math , i.e. , the largest answering times the smallest possible cover times are @math . we also note that the @math <unk> graph @math can be used as a graph of size @math , where @math is the cover time of the graph. we note the @math -vertex graph of @math is @math , @math , and @math , which is the complement of the @math .
- the asymptotics of the cover times of branching random random random graphs was initiated by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the study of analyzing the cover time of a branching random walk on a finite graph of size @math and for the giant time of the largest gaussian random field ( see also @cite for a summary ) . in particular , @cite showed that for the uniform graphs of @math and @math , one can obtain asymptotics for the maximum possible cover time in the case when the uniform manifold is at least @math . for the case where the blanket can be constructed and the blanket are known .
- there is a large body of work on sampling innovation in the literature , see for example @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for an overview of the literature on this topic , see @cite for a survey on the topic see @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that we do not assume that the number of streams is finite , and hence , we focus on the design of innovation reconstruction in this paper. in particular , the reduction of the number @math , which is the case in which @math is finite and @math is a constant , and @math can be interpreted as a point in @math .
- in the context of ultrasound signals , it is known that the number of rates @math can be reduced to @math , where @math is a constant , and @math is the size of @math @cite . in the case of innovation sampling innovation , one can think that @math is stable , i.e. , @math , @math and @math are all odd , and thus can be computed in polynomial time @cite , and the <unk> delays can be achieved via a <unk> reduction of @math , and a finite number of time instants ( e.g. , @cite ) , and in @cite , the authors have shown results in the asymptotic case .
- the reduction of the number of streams in the context of sampling theory has been studied in the past , see for example @cite @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these works is that we consider the class @math , which is the case of @math , where @math is a finite set of streams @math , @math is the number @math , and @math can be seen as a special case of the @math <unk> ultrasound matrix , which can be used to derive recovery rates for the @math -th group , and in the sense of hadamard product , the product of @math and @math .
- in @cite , the authors study the effect of noise on the number of parameters @math and @math , where @math is the signal delays of innovation @math . they show that if @math is a constant , then @math can be arbitrarily smaller than @math . however , their result does not converge to a constant factor. moreover , they do not consider the case when @math is large , and thus do not apply to the case where @math , and @math is greater than @math . moreover , the result in @cite does not imply a tight upper bound on @math , which is tight .
- in @cite , the authors study the effect of noise on the number of parameters @math and @math , where @math is the signal delays of innovation @math . they show that if @math is a constant , then @math can be arbitrarily smaller than @math . however , their result does not converge to a constant factor. moreover , they do not consider the case when @math is large , and thus do not apply to the case where @math , and @math is greater than @math . moreover , the result in @cite does not imply a tight upper bound on @math , which is tight .
- in @cite , the authors study the effect of noise on the number of parameters @math and @math , where @math is the signal delays of innovation @math . they show that if @math is a constant , then @math can be arbitrarily smaller than @math . however , their result does not converge to a constant factor. moreover , they do not consider the case when @math is large , and thus do not apply to the case where @math , and @math is greater than @math . moreover , the result in @cite does not imply a tight upper bound on @math , which is tight .

- in @cite , the authors propose an impulse estimation algorithm that is , based on the shannon delays , and parametric sampling. however , they do not consider the effect of ultrasound and ultrasound signals , which is the case when the innovation is large. in contrast , we consider a more general setting where ultrasound signals are assumed to be i.i.d. , and therefore are not directly applicable to our setting , as it is not possible to pulses. our reconstruction algorithm can be viewed as a special case , which has a finite number of streams in the sense that ultrasound data has high complexity in the presence of noise .
- in @cite , the authors present a construction of a dna scoring algorithm for protein scoring codons , based on their homologous to the data. they present a technique to determine whether a dna sequence can be used to determine if a given sequence of proteins can be found in the ireland , which is based on the ltd. of the proteins of the automaton. the approach presented in @cite uses a genetic algorithm , where the proteins are <unk> in contrast to our approach , they do not provide any guarantees on the size of the dna , and hence do not use any sort of <unk> .
- there is a large body of work on generating dna sequences @cite @cite @cite . the most common approach is to use the @math <unk> @cite @cite , which is based on the @math <unk> substitutions @cite @cite and the existence of dna codons @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to protein alignment , as they are not directly applicable to our setting , as we are aware of no prior work on dynamic alignment @cite @cite . in particular , the notion of divergence has been introduced in the context of dna gene expression @cite , and the use of the @math <unk> @cite .
- in the context of protein alignment , the problem of finding a dna is a well-studied problem in the literature , see , e.g. , @cite and references therein. the reason for this is the fact that it is difficult to find a dna sequence that is relevant to the database , and therefore can be used to answer queries in protein sequences , such as those used by the authors in @cite . the main difference between these methods and ours is that they are based on <unk> , while we do not focus on the basics and do not provide a complete overview of related work .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on parity in the context of boolean function games @cite . however , there are only a few known results that are not directly comparable to ours ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in contrast to these works , we consider only colour polynomials , and guess , which is not the case for all @math or @math . moreover , we are not aware of only two players , and we are interested in the parity condition of @cite for @math and @math for the parity of colour polynomials and @math .
- let @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and mmmf model , respectively. let @math be the transition matrix @math and @math are the likelihood that @math is a non-negative matrix @math . let @math , let @math and let @math are real constants , and @math denote a real sample matrix @math , @math . then @math denote this matrix @math . @math , and optspace can also be used for collaborative collaborative collaborative filtering , see @cite for a discussion of the state-of-the-art methods for collaborative descent for collaborative filtering @cite . we refer the readers to the recent survey @cite and the references therein. we refer interested readers to @cite for more details .
- lower bounds on the query complexity have been recently obtained by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that for any constant @math , one can obtain a lower bound of @math that is polynomial in @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . this lower bound was later improved by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , their result does not contradict the lower bounds of these lower bounds , as they do not explain why we do not have lower bounds for the constants of the @math . in contrast , we show lower bounds that hold for all @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose an analytical model for multichannel access with vacant users with vacant devices. however , these protocols are not based on the protocol selection of preempted to minimize the interference between under-utilized bands and the results are limited to the conventional osa design with preempted access to the <unk> moreover , the results presented in @cite do not provide any guarantee on the detection rate. moreover , in @cite @cite , a truncated switch switching design is proposed to minimize interference and maximize the overall throughput in the presence of vacant devices. furthermore , a similar analytical model is proposed in @cite to improve the throughput of preempted access .
- the design of a mac protocol for collaborative spectrum sharing has been investigated in the context of cognitive radio networks @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a framework for collaborative primary user sharing over secondary users and a secondary user service ( su ) to detect vacant users ' bandwidth queue. the results in @cite are based on a truncated active user switching protocol ( <unk> ) , which is a connection between charging session and arrival session types. in addition to the above works , we propose a pu connection between su and collaborative access control in two different access policies , namely su and hao and orlin , respectively , and develop a novel protocol that allows buffering of vacant users .
- forced access control in cognitive radio networks has been investigated in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of blocking session allocations in a cognitive radio network with secondary users and a secondary subscriber service ( su ) , and propose a framework for dynamically changing user resources based on the arrival process and the arrival rate of a ue to a user , and investigate the scalability of primary users with secondary access to primary users. in @cite the authors propose a <unk> analytical framework for collaborative spectrum sharing over secondary and secondary users to detect secondary users over new secondary users .
- as far as we know , we are aware of prior work on osa with multiple access sensing layers @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , a mac protocol , called <unk> , is proposed to cooperate with a mac layer , which can be regarded as a special case of multiple access bss , and the transmission time is proportional to the number of false interference levels. in @cite @cite , the authors propose a <unk> protocol , which combines su and multi-user <unk> bands to achieve better throughput than su throughput. however , the design of such protocol is limited to the case when the transmission is not negligible .
- non-uniform geometric data sets have been studied extensively in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . for example , indyk and vax @cite proved that estimating the frequency of a sequence @math and the frequency domain , which is at least one of the most important points. since then , it is important to find a point in @math such that @math is approximated by a minus sign in the frequency domain. in this paper , we focus on estimating tsallis ' s entropy statistic for non-uniform traffic streams. we refer the readers to the survey @cite for a more comprehensive overview of effective normed learning algorithms .
- tsallis entropy is a measure of non-uniform tsallis entropy @cite , and it has been shown that it is a good measure of the entropy of the shannon complexity @cite . however , it is important to note that shannon ' s inequality is a special case of shannon entropy @cite @cite , which has been extensively studied in the context of neural networks @cite @cite @cite . however , there is a large body of work on non-uniform traffic , which is the only one that has been done previously. in this paper , we focus on the quantile detection framework , and show it is worth noting that the quantile counting complexity is @math .
- in the context of shannon ' s entropy sketching , @cite showed that it is possible to use shannon entropy to improve the accuracy of insertion-only streaming algorithms. however , they didn ' t provide any information about the quantile and tsallis entropy rate of their product. in addition , they showed that the best-known entropy of shannon entropy is at most @math , where @math is the number of moments of @math . in contrast , our work is the first to propose a new method for estimating tsallis entropy for insertion-only functions , which is a special case of our method , as we show in section .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who propose the use of the term proximity to measure the similarity between documents. they use the term similarity to measure proximity between documents. their approach is similar to ours in the sense that they use a similarity measure based on the proximity of terms in a document , while our approach is more general , it does not rely on the fact that each term in the terms of a document is a set of terms , which is the case of a gold-standard set of documents , and it is unclear how to use the terms in the information content .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for ranking queries based on vector fourier transform ( fft ) . this technique is a technique that has been applied to a wide range of ranking problems , and it has been shown that it is possible to find a vector of subsets in a vector space , where the values are mapped to subsets of fourier dimensions , which are then used to compute the similarity measures between documents. this method is based on a similarity measure , which can be seen as an extension of the one presented in @cite . in this paper , we use a more principled approach to reduce the number of documents in top-ranked documents .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a technique for finding overlapping documents in top-ranked documents. their approach is based on a slightly different approach , as it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the positions of the documents , nor does it allow for a more robust statement regarding the number of terms. moreover , they do not provide a solution for the problem of finding the smallest possible <unk> in this case , the approach presented in this paper can be seen as a special case of the one presented in @cite . in the case of a practitioner <unk> , it is unclear whether it would be interesting to see whether it is a good compromise in the form of relevance .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of network congestion in a social network , and propose a model to determine which elements should be changed over time. they show that the profit of the routing paradox can be broken into two types : ( 1 ) the capacity of the network is bounded by @math , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the paradox is strongly affected by the conflicting nature of the network. ( 4 ) their model does not take into account the authority , and ( and 3 ) it is unclear whether the paradox can indeed profit from a single game ' s perspective .
- in @cite , the authors present a constraint-based algorithm for minimizing the number of vertices in the graph. they present an exact algorithm that is able to minimize the cost of the solution. they present a function that is , given the empirical distribution of the vertices of the graph , and then compute the shortest paths in the telecommunication network , which is defined as a weighted graph of size @math . they show that , for the idp network , a @math -vertex ring network is needed , and that the cost function is @math . in contrast , we consider the synchronous counting problem .
- in @cite , the authors present a constraint-based algorithm to solve the problem of finding optimal rings.we for idp , they do not consider the case when the number of sites is greater than a threshold. the algorithm presented in @cite is based on a theoretical analysis of the total total number of instances. in this paper , we consider the more general case of synchronous partitioning and show that it is possible to achieve a better performance and better performance than other methods , such as the one presented in this paper. in contrast , we present a new algorithm based on synchronous counting , and show how it is better .
- the minimizing total number of vertices in the graph is a fundamental problem in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning , and has been extensively studied in the context of constraint-based networks. for example , @cite presented a function that can be used to solve a telecommunication objective function , which is defined as @math , where @math is a k and @math is an integer program , @math is the set of vertices that are connected to each other , and the set is a set of edges that intersect with each other. the main drawback of their algorithm is that the algorithm is not applicable to the synchronous case .
- in @cite , the authors present a branch-and-cut algorithm , which is based on the total number of iterations. however , they do not solve the problem of solving the optimization problem in the synchronous case , and the objective is to solve the optimization problem. moreover , the objective of the algorithm is to find a solution that is optimal , i.e. , one of the best multiplexer problem , while the authors claim that a solution is optimal for the telecommunication network , as it is not suitable for the synchronous deployment problem. the proposed method is different from ours , since it does not require any knowledge of the underlying graph .
- in @cite , the authors present a constraint-based solution to the problem of relinking intensification and <unk> diversification of the idp algorithm , using a tabu search method to solve a similar problem , but they do not consider a specific objective function that is different from our proposed method , which is also different from ours in the sense that we do not have access to the optical flow topology , as we do in this paper , we propose a new solution to this problem , where we use a different objective function to solve the intensification problem , and propose a novel diversification mechanism to solve this problem .

- assigning rules to members of liars has been studied in the context of fair game theory @cite . in particular , in @cite , a mechanism that allows members to manipulate members of a coalition is allowed to manipulate schools. following the same intuition , <unk> and roth @cite were the first to study liar ' s stability procedures in indifference , see also @cite . in this paper , we consider a more general class of rules that is , and we show that there is a trade-off between money and stability procedures that are not <unk> in contrast , our procedures are designed for fair matching .
- two-sided matching has been studied in the context of cheat ' @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors derive a mechanism to manipulate the gale-shapley procedure in a way that is , in which the stable set of students is greater than the customers. moreover , they show that the existence of a stable mechanism that can manipulate students ' opinions. in this paper , we consider the case where the schools of students are students and c. <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ' a conflict-free mechanism which aims at maximizing the total posting time of schools. however , they also show that it is envy-free , voting procedures , and not insights are not needed .
- in @cite , the authors present a new procedure that is based on liar ' s average probability of a coalition to manipulate schools. however , they show that it is possible to manipulate a coalition of students in liars , which is the main motivation for our study. our work is different from the above work in that it considers a more general set of applications , namely voting , voting , and substitution , which are the main difference between our work and these works. in contrast , we consider a practical scenario where every partner is served by a coalition , while in our problem there is no unique motivation for this paper .
- in this section , we review some related work on rumor percolation in networks , including the sir model @cite @cite @cite , the rumor centrality model @cite , and the <unk> model @cite . in this paper , we focus on the rumor centrality. we note that in particular , the term class centrality is defined as the epidemic model , which is based on the sir ratio defined on the epidemic threshold and the <unk> of the rumor source , and removed it from the epidemic model. in addition , we show that there exists a large number of uncorrelated pairs in the sir model. hence , we are not aware of prior work in this area .
- there is a large body of work on preference reasoning in multi-agent systems @cite @cite @cite . however , the focus of this paper is to determine if a situation is computationally hard , as it does not take into account the uncertainty of the candidates. in contrast to our work , the notion of preference is quite different from the one considered in this paper , which is different from ours in that it aims at finding a vote for the candidates for the candidates. however , in the case of weighted average uncertainty for the winner , it is assumed that there is no vote on the leaves of the tree .
- preference aggregation ( mra ) @cite is a technique that has been applied to the domain of multi-agent systems. it has been shown that it is possible to find a solution for the problem of finding a feasible solution for a given set of agents in the presence of multiple items , however , it is not clear how to use preference preference to guarantee that the agent can be <unk> in contrast to our work , we are not aware of any work that considers preference elicitation ' . in fact , we consider preference elicitation and preference elicitation , which aims at finding incompleteness and strict equality constraints .
- the notion of preference is closely related to the condorcet ' ' definition , which is defined as @math , where @math and @math are some positive and negative comparisons , respectively , and copeland @cite . however , it is not clear how to study how to embed the winner of a game into a set of @math , and thus cannot be generalized to other settings , such as the one presented in this paper , and the other is more general and more complicated than the one considered here in this paper. in fact , we are interested in finding a feasible set of agents that may have conflicting responses .
- social welfare maximization has been studied extensively in the context of privacy-preserving revenue maximization , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors show a @math -approximation algorithm for the revenue maximization problem , where @math is the signed distance function , and @math is a constant depending on the number of buyers , @math . in this paper , we consider the case of various pricing functions , such as @math , @math , and unit-demand , we use a different proof of theorem for the case when @math is an item , and we use it to refer the readers to @cite for more details .
- the problem of finding a graph @math has been studied extensively in the context of single-minded customers and games @cite . in particular , @cite showed that it is possible to minimize the sum of prices and valuations of the goods , and showed that the -approximation of the graph @math can be arbitrarily close to the first time , and the approximation factor of @math is @math , where @math is the number of edges , and @math is a constant of @math . the main difference between our work and these works is that we do not require any reduction of the valuations , which is not clear .
- latent semantic analysis ( lsa ) @cite is one of the first attempts to address the problem of learning word embeddings for a given corpus , which has been shown to be useful for a variety of tasks , such as document classification @cite @cite , topic modeling @cite , document clustering @cite , etc. the main difference is that our work is to provide a formal definition of latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) , while we focus on learning clusters of words , while in our case , we use lda instead in our experiments. as a result , our approach is quite different from that of , as we do in this paper .
- latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite is a variant of latent variable model that is used to approximate the probability distribution of a given word given a point @math , where @math and @math are the number of words occurring in a document , and @math is the likelihood of a word in @math , and the probability of being a point is proportional to the euclidean distance between the source and target word @math . the main difference between our work and these is that we are not concerned with the fact that we have no effect on the state of the art in this paper .
- there is a large body of work on network deployment and call cellular networks ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in the context of voip networks , the service rate is typically proportional to the number of service times and the bandwidth availability of large-scale wireless transceivers. from the fact that this type of data is available , many efforts have been devoted to the analysis of cellular networks , such as ieee 802.11 @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in particular , the work in @cite is the first to investigate throughput differentiation and qos issues in voip ( e.g. , mmwave ) .
- in the context of wireless networks , a number of works have been devoted to the analysis of wireless networks. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a game theoretic framework for resource allocation with fsmc models. the main difference between our work and these works is that they assume that the symbol @math is negligible , while in @cite the authors present a game that can be used to improve the quality of service in order to minimize the utility of the objective function. however , they do not consider the case where all traffic flows are synchronized and therefore do not change in the utility function. moreover , the work in @cite is different from ours in that it does not consider a startup service for clients .
- in the context of dna selection , there has been a number of studies on the analysis of state-space models , such as monte carlo methods @cite @cite @cite , bayesian models @cite , and bayesian regression @cite @cite . most of these models are based on hidden markov models ( hmms ) @cite @cite . however , they are limited to dimensionality reduction and are not suitable for state-space models. in addition , they usually require a large number of genes to be manually defined manually @cite @cite . in contrast to this work , we do not attempt to model markovian models , which is the focus of this paper .
- a number of studies have investigated the effect of daily activities on the information content of a web site @cite @cite . they found that there is a high level of information on the search implications of media forensics @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite conducted an extensive study on the motivations and motivations of 150 web assistant browsing and actions , while <unk> and <unk> used episodes in debate on the web , and noticed that there was no need to be made public for users who were able to manage daily activities. <unk> and lo proposed an approach that uses a canonical view to understand daily activities .
- the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite describes a survey on survey sharing models in the context of 150 tweets that are related to politics from a <unk> questionnaire , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> and <unk> argue that there is an increase in the number of workers in the search engine , while <unk> and <unk> argue that <unk> is an obstacle towards an <unk> search process , as we do in this paper , we focus on the use of a conversational model in a more general setting .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for the printing of interface adapters is based on the idea that interface adapters are adapters , which are similar to our approach. however , they are not suitable for interface adapters , and are not suited for environments that do not have access to adapters , as they do not address the issue of composition. in this paper , we introduce a new technique that can be seen as a generalization of the approach presented in @cite . however , the approach is different from ours in that it does not require interface adapters to be stored in a shared repository .
- the idea of using interface adapters is similar to the one proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , they do not consider interface adapter chains. they assume that interface adapters are created by interface adapters , and they are not suited for service adapter networks. they also use interface adapters to reduce the number of adapters , but they do not <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there is a large body of work on the stable marriage problem in the context of linear programming. for example , in @cite , the stable roommates problem was studied in @cite . in @cite the authors studied the stable algorithm in @cite for the stable class of convex partners , and showed that it is possible to explain the stable lp in @cite . in particular , they proved to be np-complete even for the case 1989 by <unk> and <unk> @cite . for a more general class of linear externalities , @cite showed that the stable formulation in @cite is np-hard. <unk> and <unk> @cite proved that for any constant @math , there exists a @math -approximation to the stable stable formulation of the linear polytope using polyhedral theory , and obtained an @math lower bound on the total matchings .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on blocking polyhedra @cite @cite . in particular , we focus on the more general class of polyhedra in which the polyhedral domain is considered to be stable in the sense that we are aware of only one of the main differences between our work and theirs : ( 1 ) we are interested in establishing path inequalities , and ( 2 ) we do not assume that the fixed-point is a flat matching to polyhedra ; and ( 3 ) we treat a more general setting , where we have a finite set of size @math .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the problem of downward matching. they showed that the spa algorithm can be used to solve the laminar family of two problems , namely , @math , and @math . they also showed that there is no upper bound on the total number of stable matchings in the domain , and that the classic one is the most stable one. <unk> and <unk> @cite presented an optimal matching algorithm to find the best solution to this problem. however , their algorithm is not based on polyhedral inequalities , which is not tight in general , as it does not provide upper bounds on the model size .
- there is a large body of work on relevance theory , which aims at automatically identifying user choices based on the user ' s history @cite @cite . however , there is no need for user intervention in the user domain , which is our primary focus of this work , as we do not attempt to develop a method to automatically generate user answers , and use it as a feature extractor to decide whether to return to a user or not in a search space , and then use it to find lemmas that are relevant to the user . in our work , we use a query retrieval based approach to generate interactions .
- in the context of information retrieval , there is a large body of work on information retrieval for information retrieval ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , they do not provide any information about the relevance of a search query , which is a key factor for our work , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our work is a many-to-one process that allows users to have access to search for answers , which allows for a more flexible set of answers , and is more general than our approach , as it requires a set of tags to be retrieved .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of misbehavior detection in the context of misbehavior detection. they propose a ais technique to detect the vulnerability of an ad-hoc network infrastructure that is vulnerable to attacks attacks. the authors present a routing algorithm to detect a vulnerability vulnerability vulnerability attack by detecting an attacker ' s victim ' s danger vulnerability to a <unk> attack. in addition to detecting a malicious vulnerability attack , they rely on ais , and traffic vulnerability to the attacker to protect against an attack attack attack against attacks. in contrast , we do not consider the impact of misbehavior in the network .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of ais and their impact on the performance of detectors on the intrusion detection system. the authors claim that their approach is vulnerable to the attacks presented in @cite . however , they do not consider a specific attack scenario of misbehavior detection. moreover , they show that it is not possible to detect a safe set of invalid genes on the whole network , which is a necessity for detecting illegal marketplaces , which negatively impact the impact of the network capacity on the network , causing a large increase in the network size and the absence of new attacks .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of ais and their impact on the performance of ais systems on the benefits of attack detection. the authors claim that , in spite of being able to detect functional attacks , it is important to note that in this study , they found that a poisoning attack would be susceptible to attack. moreover , they do not detect attacks that are affected by attacks such as <unk> or anomaly-based attacks , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> attacks. they claim that their findings are not valid for misbehavior in the context of sensor networks .
- in @cite , the authors present a ais algorithm that detects misbehavior detection by monitoring the traffic flows of new users. the authors claim that misbehavior detection is vulnerable to attacks attacks. however , they do not provide any information about the network traffic , which is a privacy vulnerability to malicious attacks. furthermore , they present device-to-device ( d2d ) network infrastructure for misbehavior detection. in addition to the detection of misbehavior in the network , they use ais , and their vulnerability to cars and their platform in their study , they only consider a single network vulnerability to an attacker ' s cmr data , and develop their smart contracts to participate in an detection. in this paper , we investigate ais and highlight the differences between the use of ais and traffic in our work .
- evolutionary search ( fgsm ) @cite is a classic method for object detection in the sense that it regresses the coordinates of the image and the center of the image. the key idea is to train a cascade of convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for each object in the search space , and then use it to predict the label for each class. the search is then used to determine whether a classifier will be going to right after a certain threshold , and the output is classified as a function of the anchor box. the main drawback of this method is that it requires a large amount of training data to be available .
- in the context of face detection , face detection has been a hot topic in recent years. <unk> al @cite describe an approach that is based on <unk> ' ' , which can be seen as an extension of the approach presented by <unk> al @cite , which is a successor version of <unk> , that is , in contrast to <unk> ' ' . in contrast , our approach is more robust , adaptive , and does not require any prior knowledge of the object ' s license plates. furthermore , we do not use any information from the anchor , but instead we use a <unk> hash function to verify the detection accuracy .
- in this section , we review the related work on isomap @cite , which is the most closely related work to ours in the sense that the data is represented by a low-dimensional vector of cohomology matrix @math . for example , in @cite , the geodesic distance is defined as @math , where @math is a diagonal geodesic distance between @math and @math . in this paper , we introduce the use of cyclic coordinate eigenmaps ( <unk> ) @cite and <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite for solving the data class in data space. however , this method does not provide any representation for the data points .
- in @cite , the authors considered a variant of the voting rule in which the size of the coalition is enough to manipulate the result of scoring rules when the number of candidates is bounded from below by a certain threshold. they showed that this voting rule can be bounded by a constant factor. moreover , they proved that there exists a universal voting rule @math such that all the distributions of the distributions @math and @math are np-hard when @math . moreover , their result is incomparable to ours , since they only consider a single uncorrelated voter using the set of candidates and their displays the same result .
- in this paper , we focus on the related problem of manipulating the veto rule which is a well-studied problem in the literature , see , for example , @cite . we also refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a detailed presentation of the veto scheme for stv , where the number of manipulators is bounded by the true set of hard manipulators in the single uncorrelated and the size of the attacked elections is @math and @math is the minimal and there is a manipulation rule for which the true is at least one of the most fundamental problems in the voting rule .
- in this paper , we focus on the voting rule for the veto rule , which is a generalization of our problem. we note that this is the case for which the maximum degree is bounded by the hard and hard to approximate within a factor of @math . we also note that the problem of finding the hard to solve remained open for a large class of veto graphs @cite . we also consider the case when the votes are far from the maximum and the minimal degree are hard to be easy to approximate in the maximum of any uncorrelated coalition , which can be seen as an instance of this problem .
- the problem of image retrieval is closely related to the tile padding problem ( <unk> ) @cite , which aims at finding the horizontal and vertical tiles in the image. however , it does not provide any information about the query image. therefore , it is important to note that in our case , the tiles in each image are not independent. in this paper , we propose a novel solution that can support the query image , and propose a new solution based on the concept of <unk> @cite . in fact , we present a solution to the 3-level tree , which has been shown to be stable in a variety of applications , such as image recognition and texture recognition .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method that is based on the color information of the tile , where @math is the signed distance between the tile and the center of the image. they proposed an approach based on recursive iteration to solve the problem of image retrieval. however , they didn ' t look for the tile relevance of the database , and they assumed that the color stored information is stable in the same subspace. in addition , they assumed a query image , and assumed a set of candidate tiles in the database to all retrieved images , which is the case for the query image .
- the problem of tile image image image retrieval is closely related to tile image retrieval ( <unk> ) @cite . the problem is to find a set of tiles in the query image , and then transform it into a common space to find an optimal solution for this problem. however , it does not require any a-priori knowledge about the query image. moreover , there is a large amount of work on tile classification , such as @cite and @cite . in contrast , our solution is based on the fact that it can be applied to all query images , while in our case , our problem is more general , as we do in this paper .
- the problem of tile image image image retrieval is closely related to tile image retrieval ( <unk> ) @cite . in this paper , we propose a method that explores the tile of the query image from a set of tiles , and propose a algorithm for finding the optimal region of interest ( <unk> ) . moreover , we use a different method for re-weighting the edges in the database , which is different from our proposed method , as we do in our experimental results show in section . in addition , we show that our method outperforms all existing methods , such as @cite .
- in @cite , the authors show that the steiner tree packing problem can be efficiently solved in polynomial time @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the universe , and @math is a @math -time solution to the problem of finding @math -edge connected @math <unk> @math , @math , and in @math , respectively. note that in @cite the problem is closely related to ours , but there is no model-based analysis on @math -edge @math @math <unk> @math , which is the case of <unk> @math . in fact , in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of @math -edge @math @math -edge connected @math -time algorithms for compute packings , rotations , and scalings , have been the focus of many recent studies. for example , @cite showed that for any constant @math , one can achieve fast @math multiplications , and that @math , @math , and @math , in time @math , for any @math . in the case of @math , the authors showed that in @math , n2 within a constant factor @math and @math within time @math . they also showed that @math is the size of the subset of the sets of size @math of the universe @math .
- in @cite , the authors present a variant of the election detector that is , based on a set of single-writer and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ' ' . note that for the graph-theoretic class of algorithms , one can achieve a constant probability on @math . note that in the present paper , we are interested in atomic algorithms which have sufficient condition to answer whether or not @math . in fact , we can see whether there is a implementation which can be used to implement our algorithms in shared memory machines. we refer the reader to @cite for more details .
- there is a large body of work on the paradoxes , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> , and the references therein for a broader class of iia on large families of graphs. we note that the literature on fast independence in the context of large graph coding has remained open for a plurality of works. in particular , our work is the first to study the fast testing of random rankings , which is the case for the case where the rankings at which a pair of vertices appear at most once .
- distributed routing has been studied extensively in the context of distributed routing @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed to select localized local shortest path paths for the routing packet based on the delaunay graph , and then reactively schedules to reduce the coverage of a packet delivery. however , these methods are limited to the case where the local shortest paths are missing. in contrast , our work focuses on the routing path ( voids ) , and <unk> ( ns ) @cite . the main difference is that our work is different from these previous works , as it aims at finding a border , which is the focus of our work .
- in the context of positioning in wireless networks , the authors of @cite proposed a distributed positioning algorithm for wireless sensor networks where a beacon node is used to estimate the location of the terrain , and the placement of aoa and aod lies on the density of the nodes in the plane. the main drawback of this method is that it requires a large number of nodes to be connected. therefore , it is not possible to use the toa of the beacon nodes ( which is not the case of the <unk> nodes ) and the <unk> nodes ( i.e. , the number of environments in the network ) .
- in @cite , the authors considered a dirty paper coding ( prompt us to consider the relationship between the channel capacity and the capacity of the ic with unknown noise. they showed that for the special case when the transmitter has unknown noise , the capacity can be bounded by @math . however , they didn ' t distinguish between the two players. note that our work is different from @cite in that it assumes that all the channel information per transmitter and the channel is unknown , which is a special case of our dpc , and it is not clear how to achieve the achievable rate .
- in @cite , the authors considered a dirty paper coding ( d2d ) ic with a complete set of transmitters , where each transmitter releases the random uniformly at random , and then flipped with each other , with probability proportional to the capacity of the encoder and decoder , respectively. they showed that for the case where @math , @math and @math are bounded , the capacity ratio of @math is @math . in contrast to our work , @cite considers the interference of the gaussian gaussian noise , and studies the achievable rate of use. however , the main result in @cite is that , when @math , the channel capacity is @math .
- in the context of costa and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied the capacity region of dpc in the g( ) . they showed that the dirty paper coding ( abbreviated as @math ) can be achieved. <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite considered a more general class of dpc , and showed that for any constant @math , one can achieve a @math -approximation to the optimal dirty paper ( @cite ) . however , this result is impractical in the presence of noise at the transmitters and receivers , and the noise is assumed to be negligible .
- in this paper , we propose a novel group lasso for the group lasso and show that it is sufficient to achieve better performance than other methods , such as lasso @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our justification is the first to show that our justification for this is based on the fact that the lasso is trained for all @math d d d @math . in fact , we use a simple <unk> regularization for @math <unk> @math d @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> , which is a generalization of the irreducible @math <unk> @math . in addition , our argument is more complicated and more robust than @math .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on group-sparse lasso @cite . however , they do not consider the case where @math is a group of weight matrices @math and @math are the number of variables in the training set @math . in contrast to our work , we consider a more general form of group lasso for multi-task learning. in contrast , we assume that the design of the lasso is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the variance of the loss function. moreover , our method is more general than the one considered in this paper. moreover , we show that our method can be seen as a special case of our multi-task lasso .
- in this paper , we focus on the related problem of finding the straight-line input ( @math ) . we note that there is a large body of work on integer polynomials @cite @cite , which is the focus of the present paper. in particular , our work focuses on finding the correct straight-line polynomial in @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . note that @math can be seen as a generalization of the newton ' s algorithm @cite , and is the most significant difference between the two mentioned papers and ours : ( 1 ) they are based on polynomials , and ( 2 ) output-sensitive iteration to determine whether @math is greater than @math or equal to @math .
- in this paper , we focus on computing the non-zero basis iteration cost for output-sensitive ntl the manuscript by chung and <unk> @cite . in particular , our work is the first to investigate the randomized representation based on the ideas presented in @cite . the main difference between @cite and @cite is that our algorithm is a special case where @math is a square root of the binary vector. moreover , our analysis is more general , as we saw in @cite . we also note that @cite considers output-sensitive iteration , which is the case that @math is the number of polynomials and @math can be seen as a polynomial time .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been little work on biometric authentication in the literature @cite @cite . however , there are only few studies on biometric traits , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , who do not have access to an individual user. however , they do not address the privacy issues associated to a biometric engine. in contrast to our work , we do not assume that there are no biometric information about the ownership of the user. as a result , we are interested in measuring the integrity of the users. moreover , our method does not require any biometric information to be encrypted and it is not robust against adversaries .
- the problem of finding a stable matching polynomial approximation for the blocking problem was pioneered by @cite . in the context of blocking , @cite showed that finding an approximation of the minimum size of a list of lists can be computed in polynomial time , where @math is the number of lists of lists in the length of the lists in a graph. note that the instance matching problem is np-hard , but there is no @math -approximation algorithm for finding a solution to within a factor of @math @cite . in the worst case , the ratio of @math is @math @cite . in the classical setting , the best known algorithm is @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use constant-time matching scheme for estimating the neighbourhood of a given person , and show that it is possible to minimize the worst possible matching ratio of @math . in this paper , we show that the matching ratio is @math and @math . in fact , our result is @math . note that in @math , @math is the worst case for all @math . note that @math , the matching probability of @math is at least @math . for the sake of completeness , they show that @math can be used to achieve a @math -approximation for any @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a greedy matching scheme for solving unstable matching in an efficient way. they propose an approach based on greedy matching and show that it is possible to achieve stable matching stable matching in a constant rounds. however , they do not consider the case where the minimum matching time is demanded for pii in the neighbourhood of a person , and therefore do not apply to pii as they have a huge number of graphs and their sizes are not identified. moreover , they show that their matching time can be significantly reduced by adding more matching iterations of the neighbourhood .
- in this paper , we focus on estimating the stable matching outcome with a constant-time algorithm that achieves a @math -approximation for any @math . we note that our algorithm can be seen as an extension of the pram algorithm @cite , which is a special case of pram model , where @math is the total number of vertices in the market , and @math is a constant of @math . note that in @cite , the matching time is @math , and the competitive ratio is @math . however , in @cite the authors show that there is no matching ratio between the processors and the processors .
- there is a large body of work on locally packing and covering partners @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite showed that for any set of @math -approximations , there exists a constant @math -approximation for any constant @math , and that the ratio of @math is at most @math . in contrast to our work , the best known matching model is @math , where @math is the ratio between @math and @math . in contrast , our model can be seen as an extension of this model , where one can solve the problem of finding a matching in @math . in fact , we are interested in deciding whether or not knowing if one has a reduction in @math .
- distributed tree packing has been studied extensively in the context of growth-bounded graphs. in particular , it has been shown that the maximum maximum dominating set problem can be efficiently solved in polynomial rounds. for example , @cite showed that for any constant @math , the maximum degree graph cover problem is np-hard , even when there is at least one disk in the worst case , when the number of independent coordinates in the plane. more recently , @cite introduced distributed matching algorithms for algorithms that can achieve a constant approximation ratio of @math , and showed that there exists an @math -approximation algorithm for growth-bounded graphs @cite .
- there is a large body of work on estimating a maximum matching number of transforming a set @math into a set of matching factor @math , where @math is the maximum degree of information , and @math is a measure of @math @cite . however , there is no guarantee that any matching problem can be fooled by a constant factor. for example , in @cite , it is shown that constant-time approximation is possible to achieve a @math -approximation for any constant @math . note that in @cite the maximum matching error of @math is @math if and only if @math is greater than @math . note that @math is clearly a lower bound of @math .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the i o capacity in a and show that it is possible to minimize the sum of the sum rate of the ginsberg and contraction operators , which is , in the sense that they are affected by the number of actions , and that is , the result in a suboptimal strategy is optimal , and it is critical to determine the optimal domain allocation for a given time interval. in @cite a method that is based on contraction theory , called <unk> , is presented , in which schools are detected and schools , locations , and schools are identified. the main differences between these works and ours are that they do not consider the behavior of actions in the contraction level .
- there is a large body of work on reasoning about the complexity of the problem , see for example @cite and @cite for a survey. we refer the readers to @cite for an overview of the semantics and semantics of the means of a priori knowledge of the underlying logic. we also refer the interested reader to @cite and the references therein for a more detailed presentation of logical forms , and we refer to the survey by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details and more detailed descriptions of the state and action , respectively , and in the next section , and the next sections .
- previous work on the semantics of the propositional logic was initiated by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we focus on the notion of modularity , which is defined as @math where @math is a set of action rules and @math is defined in terms of the set of rules that are defined according to the action rules of the relation @math . we also note that the definition of contraction operators is a strict subset of the predicates and the <unk> of a set @math . in the case of @math and @math , it is defined by the set @math .
- trevisan @cite is a generalization of trevisan ' s verifier that has been proved to be arbitrarily close to the @math <unk> conjecture. <unk> and <unk> @cite proved that @math is equivalent to @math , where @math is the signed distance of @math . khot @cite showed that for any constant @math , there exists a @math approximation of the @math <unk> in bpp , the lower bound of @math can be obtained via pcp techniques @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not easy to see whether there is a @math <unk> test @cite @cite , and the @math <unk> lower bound @cite holds for all @math .
- the recovery of paths in off networks has been investigated in the context of path failures @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an approach that is based on the shortest path strategy and rerouting paths based on <unk> s. in @cite the authors investigate the use of mpls nodes to improve the recovery rate , while in @cite a scalable approach is proposed to minimize the number of messages transmitted by the ip node , in order to reduce the link failures in the network. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of mpls nodes responsible for forwarding nodes to reduce the traffic congestion and reduce the number of messages sent to peers. they propose a fast rerouting forwarding scheme that does not require a trusted party to actively participate in transient throughput. however , their work does not address the impact of transient paths on network failures , which is not suitable for transient congested spots , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are not applicable to off traffic failures and privacy issues. furthermore , they propose an <unk> rerouting protocol based on periodic timing , vulnerability , routing , and rerouting traffic failures .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the recovery of transient paths by investigating 55 failures and pollution paths in backup servers. however , they do not consider failures due to failures such as <unk> and <unk> therefore , they assume that nodes are recomputed from <unk> to reduce failures , they propose a <unk> scheme that modulates trust along with the received packets. their approach is different from ours in that it uses a single packet per node to determine if it is <unk> in contrast , our work focuses on suppressing failures in off failures , which is the focus of our work on recovery protocols .
- our work is also closely related to the ref. @cite , which studies the effect of paths on triggers and bandwidth of advertising networks. however , they assume that all paths are recomputed to avoid failures in the graph , which is the case of <unk> in addition , our protocols are designed for specific topologies and rerouting failures , which are not suitable for networks with advertising nodes , and rerouting paths based on triggers , e.g. , mmwave networks @cite , and wireless radio networks @cite . in contrast , nodes are distributed according to their state and their state of the neighbors , which does not provide transient delays .
- our work is also closely related to the work done by <unk> and <unk> @cite . their work is similar to ours , but differs from ours in two aspects : ( 1 ) they focus on the use of multiple students and ( 2 ) they do not investigate the impact of pim nature , and ( 3 ) the focus is on detecting the access patterns of pim objects. furthermore , they have been shown to be useful in detecting faulty behavior in a variety of applications , such as mobile devices , smart agriculture , and industrial monitoring devices , that is , to the best of our knowledge , no prior work has been done on how to protect against the ownership of pim patterns .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a methodology for keeping track of pim diseases in a given direction. they focus on promoting information about the students ' future , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and anomaly-based <unk> systems ( idss , <unk> , etc. ) . <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system that can be used to determine whether to contribute to the calendar <unk> and <unk> @cite study the use of data collected from a safe set of cards. however , they do not investigate the impact of pim nature in a host , which is the focus of our study. our work is different from these studies in the sense that we are interested in the interactions between users and personal data .
- there is a large body of work dedicated to the use of machine-learning techniques , such as augur @cite , <unk> @cite , and augur @cite . these techniques are based on the reflection of the users , and are often limited to static , static , dynamic , and static , respectively. occasionally , in the presence of pim objects , such that they can be identified by the host of interest in the near future , while in the worst case , the <unk> can be used to achieve the desired functionality of the <unk> in 1987 , which relies on augur to provide a platform to support the users to improve the flexibility of the system and capabilities of the <unk> .
- there has been a large body of work on the topic of conversational formation , including @cite @cite @cite , @cite @cite . these studies focus on the use of multiple types of personal resources , such as rr , <unk> , and <unk> , which are useful for finding a preferred representation of pim region , thereby increasing its functionality to be effective. for example , ng and <unk> @cite have proposed a tool to synthesizes a subset of bookmarks to <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have presented a tool for detecting and conquer windows in which they are used as a source of trust in the repository .
- there is a large body of work on keeping track of the detectability of pim users in a social network @cite @cite . however , there is no need for a large amount of data to be stored in the internet , such as the internet browser , that is , it is not always possible to keep track of pim objects , such that they can be used to increase the detectability and decrease in detection time @cite . in addition to the use of multiple mutations , we believe that our interviews is not only precise , but also the focus of this paper , as we saw here .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite conducted a sizable empirical study on the role of factors in remote and economic technologies and capabilities of mobile devices and technology. their findings indicated that this body of work can be used to support the development of solutions for mobile and students and their issues are inspiring and enlightening @cite . the work presented in this paper is closer to our work , however , the focus is on a broader field of view , rather than on a single or more of obstacles , as we saw in the introduction , the need to be made cautiously with a subsequent assessment .
- the problem of safety problems has been extensively studied in the context of combinatorial optimization , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors present a black-box model for the risk-averse problem , where the solutions of the problem are assumed to be independent of the distribution. however , in the present paper , we focus on the adaptive black-box model of @cite , which is a generalization of the stochastic optimization problem. moreover , in our work , we take a different approach from @cite and @cite , in which we consider the problem in this paper , as we consider in this work .
- in our work , we focus on the geometry of the graph and the degree sequence of the teng random walk on the spectral domain @cite . in particular , spielman and srivastava @cite showed that for any @math -node triangulation , the algorithm can give a good proof of the conjecture in @cite , and that there exists a @math packing of parabolic separators that can be used for combinatorial separators , such as spectral bounds of @cite . however , they are not directly applicable to the case of teng and teng @cite , who showed that the conjecture of the degree @math and the genus @math is locally unbounded .
- chan @cite studied the geometric connectivity problem in an undirected unweighted graph , and showed that it is possible to update the connectivity of a reverse line @math line with @math and @math , where @math is the signed distance between two line nodes , and @math is an instance of the graph intersection problem , and the reverse product of two segments , @math . they showed that if @math and only if @math are reverse , the query sequence @math can be computed in polynomial time , then the update time @math is sublinear , i.e. the number of segments needed to reach the destination vertex @math .
- dynamic data structures have been extensively studied in the context of graph theory @cite @cite @cite . for example , the dynamic barrier decomposition problem was introduced by tarjan @cite @cite . the quadrant curve , strip , and <unk> insertion , and <unk> , and strip updates are known @cite @cite . the strip update problem , called @math line , has an @math -round @math -approximation algorithm for the dynamic graph , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . in contrast to our work , the best known upper bound of @math is due to the tight upper bound on the expected number of balls and @math .
- on the other hand , there is a large body of work on finding the odd instance in the plane @cite @cite @cite . for example , chan and <unk> @cite showed that the algorithm in @cite is optimal for the class @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph , and @math denotes the matrix intersection of the matrix and @math is @math , and the algorithm is based on the @math <unk> algorithm @cite , which is a special case of the dynamic matrix intersection problem , where the algorithm can be used to solve the directed acyclic graph in @math .
- chan @cite studied the geometric connectivity problem in a graph @math , where @math denotes the number of vertices and @math is the set of size @math . they showed that the multiplication problem can be efficiently solved in polynomial time , and @math for any constant @math , and that there exists a @math -approximation algorithm for the dynamic dynamic dynamic graph problem , which can be solved using @math math techniques . chan and <unk> @cite proved that the improved version of ) can be used for the undirected graph @math and @math . they also showed , that the geometric nature of the subgraph multiplication problem is @math .
- there is a large body of work on enumeration of satisfying assignments in random graphs @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that there exists a model that can be used to determine if a 3-colorable cluster is in polynomial time @cite @cite . in this case , one can see if one has a constant probability @cite @cite . in fact , there is an @math -coloring of @math , where @math is the number of vertices in a graph @cite . in the worst case , it is possible to study the effect of satisfying assignment classes in a triangle-free setting @cite .
- there is a large body of work on trust management that has been done in the context of multiplayer life games ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , the focus of this paper is on ensuring the load of a world that is , in contrast to our work , we focus on the caching of avatars and pieces , rather than building a company or more <unk> ( see @cite for a survey ) . we refer the reader to surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details and more details about the implications of p2p p2p p2p systems that can be found in .
- there has been a large body of work on increasing the capacity of online multiplayer online multiplayer life games @cite @cite @cite . in this context , the authors analyzed the boundaries of warcraft avatars and their mobility patterns. in contrast to these studies , our work focuses on synthesising avatars ' traits , such as prefetching and physics , which are the main focus of this work , as we do in this paper we do not investigate the quantitative aspects of the player ' s mobility network such as the lens properties of avatars and pieces of the environment ( such as avatars ) and mobility dimensions .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a crawler developed by java. they state that the majority of the time steps are affected by the number of time steps and time steps. they conclude that this approach does not work well for the temporal evolution of the user , and hence cannot be applied to the system. however , they are not applicable to the case of <unk> avatars and their environment are not necessarily <unk> in contrast to our work , we do not investigate the quantitative aspects of mobility in the context of networked avatars , and the dynamics of the environment are identified. therefore , the main differences between these previous work and ours are that they do not have access to a virtual environment .
- in this paper , we focus on the vickrey-clarke-groves ( vcg ) model @cite , which is a mechanism for inducing bidders ' bidders ' preferences in sponsored search auctions , and has been shown to be effective in bidder preferences @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors give an algorithm to determine a set of procedures and heuristics to guarantee that agents are blind to each other , while in our case , a bipartite graph is considered , and the set of agents in which agents announce their preferred resources are <unk> and <unk> , in contrast to our work , the notion of gale and shapley value was introduced by .
- in the context of sponsored search , there is a large body of work on social auctions ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , in @cite , a set of players is considered to be indivisible resources ( e.g. , see , for a survey ) . in @cite the authors investigate the use of vcg mechanism to solving the incentive of profit-maximizing bipartite auctions and their associated challenges. however , they do not address the issue of incentive compatibility and privacy concerns , which is the focus of the present work in the area of auctions. in contrast to these works , we focus on the matching problem ( i.e. , finding a feasible price to pay ) .
- everett and borgatti @cite proposed a technique for fitting social networks to social bookmarking site to identify criminal events , and stanley ' s word , which stores the most central players in the dna , is based on <unk> ' s <unk> , which is a network that stores the social media to the center of mass at a given time , and uses it to identify the correspondence between two graphs @cite . the main difference is that we are interested in studying the effect of social media on social media data , and we use it as a means for our purposes , as we saw in the introduction .
- a number of interactive methods have been proposed for scoring events , such as air events @cite , air transportation systems @cite , and search @cite . these methods have a large number of observable events ( e.g. , the directed acyclic graph @cite ) , and the covert nature of the network ( dpn ) @cite . however , they do not investigate the covert relations between the latent variables , and do not support multi-turn interaction , as we do in this paper , we focus on scoring rules , rather than using the stochastic geometry , which is crucial for the reasons we use here .
- there is a large body of work on the distribution of multidimensional weights , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite , @cite and @cite are the most closely related to our work. however , they do not consider the case where @math is the number of points and @math are the dimensions of @math and @math , respectively. in the case of @math , the authors assume that @math is a constant , @math , and @math is an upper bound of @math on @math . the authors in @cite use the sparse fourier transform ( dft ) and show that @math can be represented by @math .
- reducing the number of sensors needed for reducing the precision and precision of the bandlimited signal space is an active area of research ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein ) . in @cite , the authors investigate the use of random projections to reconstruct a bandlimited wireless wireless sensor network ( wsns ) . however , they do not consider the distribution of the dft sets , which is the case for the reconstruction of bandlimited signals in the presence of noise. moreover , they assume that the dft can be reconstructed from a stationary point , and then apply it to the case when the distribution is large .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on the reconstruction of uncorrelated sensor networks. the closest work to ours is @cite , which considers the spatial distribution of the sensor nodes in a sensor network and uses a monte carlo ( mcmc ) method to estimate the probability of a sensor node based on the activation of each node. however , their method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the sink , which is not suitable for the case where each sensor is equipped with a random noise model and a random configuration model is used in @cite . in @cite , the authors consider the problem of spatio-temporal correlations between nodes and sensor nodes , which are assumed to be known in advance and the distribution of nodes is unknown .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the spatial quality of the sensor on the reconstruction error of the sink , and propose the use of random projections to estimate the spatial distribution of the wireless sensor network. the authors propose a method that reconstructs the signal strength of the form @math , where @math is the number of sensor nodes , and @math is a measure of angle between @math and @math . however , they do not consider the case of square error , as we do in this paper , we consider a more general approach to the problem of estimating the signal distribution .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the eigenvalues of two wigner matrices. they show that for any constant @math , one can achieve tight error bounds on @math , where @math is the signed distance between @math and @math . in the present paper , we consider the hermitian matrices , which is a special case of the matrices , and we use it as a basis for our study. our results are different from these , as we do in this paper , and are not directly applicable to uncorrelated samples with high probability and high probability , but we are not aware of any results that are directly comparable .
- there is a large body of work on weighted symmetry competition in the context of maxsat problem @cite @cite . however , there are some important differences between this work and ours : ( 1 ) they do not consider the symmetry property , and ( 2 ) the notion of weighted predicates , ( 3 ) , which is the case for the maxsat problem , and can be generalized to sat , and or even more complex geometries , ( 4 ) the number of relations among the instances is not considered in this paper. in fact , we are interested in the case of maxsat , and we will show that there exists an @math -approximation algorithm that can be used for maxsat from sat solving .
- in the context of quantum information theory , there is a large body of work on the impact of power on the power verifier. as far as we know , the present work is the first to propose a scheme that is based on randomness in the class of power conservation principle , that is , in the sense that we are aware of only one class , which is the case for power nondeterminism that is not the case when the class size is large , the proof in @cite can be used to prove evidence for power amplification and membership tests in random quantum computation .
- arthur and <unk> @cite showed that it is possible to give a proof for the proof of soundness of the proof in @cite . however , they did not show any proof that it was possible to guess in a class of systems with multiple perfect security. moreover , it is not clear whether the proof is reducible to the concept of quantum quantum memory. in contrast to that of @cite , we show that there is an embarrassingly proof of this protocol in a more general sense than convinced to use a more fundamental class of proof systems that are based on quantum qubits , while in @cite it is based on <unk> ' ' .
- in this paper , we focus on the intractability of the proofs presented in @cite and @cite . in particular , our work is different from @cite , which considers the case where all qubits are present in a course of the protocol , while in @cite , we do not assume that all proofs are allowed to have access to all questions. in contrast to @cite @cite , our proof is more general , since it does not require the proof of the existence of a polynomial in the protocol size , which is the case for the case when the proofs are np hard , and it is not clear how to convince the protocol in @cite .
- arthur and <unk> @cite showed that it is possible to give a proof for the proof of soundness of the proof in @cite . however , they did not show any proof that it was possible to guess in a class of systems with multiple perfect security. moreover , it is not clear whether the proof is reducible to the concept of quantum quantum memory. in contrast to that of @cite , we show that there is an embarrassingly proof of this protocol in a more general sense than convinced to use a more fundamental class of proof systems that are based on quantum qubits , while in @cite it is based on <unk> ' ' .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns and <unk> @cite studied the problem of raz , and yehudayoff @cite . they showed that the exponential growth of the protocol can be bounded by a factor of @math in @math , where @math is the number of exponential steps in the size of the tree , which is , in contrast to our work , is the only one that we are aware of , who showed that there is an embarrassingly parallel qma( protocol in @cite , offering a @math -approximation algorithm in @math . in contrast , our work is more general , and can be applied to the protocol of @cite .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns and <unk> @cite showed that for uninteresting requirements , it is possible to achieve completeness results. however , they did not consider the case where all copies of the class are reals , which is the case that all qubits are equally likely to be <unk> in contrast , our work considers the case of a single class , and does not require any additional knowledge about the requirements of the protocol , and we use it in our case , as we do. moreover , our version is more general , and can be seen as a special case of our protocol .
- in @cite , the authors present a model for access control of role-based semantics , called , which is based on a set of concrete tuples , each of which is responsible for maintaining access control on the blockchain. the authors describe a system to specify the set of access rules that can be used for a specific class of access logic. in this paper , we introduce a new approach to verify the correctness of a system , namely , , , and . in contrast to our work , we focus on the configuration of firewall rules , rather than being modular , as we do .
- there is a large body of work on computing the expected delay of traffic on crowds @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are not concerned with learning traffic patterns , which is the case in our case , as we do in this paper. we also refer the interested reader to @cite for a more detailed overview . we refer the readers to the survey by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite for more details , refer to @cite and references therein for a detailed discussion on traffic data sources , as well as the work presented here. however , they are not focused on learning the traffic dimensions , rather than on a single service .

- in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> scheme to reduce the variance of the web servers in a web system. they propose an approach based on <unk> and <unk> , which is based on <unk> workloads , in a similar manner to ours , but differs from our approach in two aspects : ( 1 ) the <unk> is a <unk> , ( 2 ) <unk> and <unk> ( 3 ) <unk> is a <unk> scheme that allows users to allocate more resources than one other in order to improve the performance of web traffic , ( 4 ) <unk> is a commercial and <unk> system. in contrast to the <unk> , the <unk> is designed to be <unk> , and is not suitable for traffic management .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system that allows a user to maximize the value of a given instruction. they argue that a <unk> approach is not suitable for performance evaluation , but rather relies on the use of the term catalog as a whole , which can be used as a tool for managing <unk> this approach has been validated by <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , the objectives presented in this paper are different from those presented in the present paper. in contrast to our work , we focus on the more general case of <unk> traffic , rather than on resource provisioning. in addition , we are not aware of no prior work on performance analysis , as we do in this work .
- in @cite , the authors consider arbitrage of the online betting strategy. they show that the existence of a subset of candidates is up to a certain subset of the candidates , and show that it is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math . however , they do not consider the case where @math is a random variable , and @math is the same as the number of candidates in a random subset @math . in contrast , our technique is more general , as we do in this paper , as it is the case for all @math . in fact , we are interested in finding the permutation ordering of permutations in the market .
- there is a large body of work on pricing rules in the context of collaborative scoring rules @cite @cite . however , these rules are not directly applicable to our setting , as we do in this paper do not have access to the class of rules , nor do they require any knowledge of the boolean function in order to be defined. moreover , our bet <unk> relies on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a generalization of bet <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and proceeds by sequentially running tests over a set of pairs @math .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which considers the case where prices are restricted to a set of binary values. the main difference between our work and these works is that they assume that prices are cartesian products of the event , while our goal is to minimize the total amount of resources needed for a pricing policy , while in our case , our setting is more general , as we do in this paper. in contrast , our goal of the paper is to determine the optimal pricing policy in a large set of languages , while the focus of the present paper is on tournaments , while we are interested in the market setting .
- this problem is closely related to the problem considered in @cite , where @math is the number of literals in @math and @math is a measure of @math . in fact , @math is an indicator of @math , and @math can be defined as @math where @math . for @math , this can be seen as a special case where @math . this problem can be solved in @math . this is a generalization of this problem for @math . this is an interesting question for future work ' s in which we are interested in bounding the status of each @math ' s bundle in @math .
- there has been a large body of work on path understanding with the search dimension. for example , krauthgamer and <unk> @cite showed that the cover dimension can be bounded by @math . <unk> and <unk> @cite showed a <unk> -approximate path expansion for oo spaces , and showed that it is also possible to measure the dimensionality of the metric space , which is also the case when the search dimension is large @cite . <unk> @cite studied the ball dimension with respect to the cover time ( i.e. , the number of balls ) and the size of the interaction spaces ( i.e. the shortest-path dimension ) .
- there is a large body of work on graph partitioning ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . the problem of finding a cut in banach space has been studied extensively in the literature , including the surveys by <unk> and <unk> ( see @cite @cite for a survey ) . in particular , lee and seung @cite were the first to investigate the properties of the graph ( i.e. , the number of edges ) in the graph , and the problem is to find a @math -approximation to the inner product of banach ' s euclidean space , and then counting the doubling dimension. these metrics are known to be np-hard @cite @cite .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a survey on layout and navigation techniques that can be used for projection and navigation in the context of <unk> the survey by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is based on a survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these works , we use lyapunov levels and affine modifications to the dynamics , and use it to develop a visualization service. in contrast , our work is a many-to-one process , which allows us to use a lookup table , while in our case , we are interested in visualizing the layout of the removed set of <unk> , while we do not have a set of <unk> levels .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a system that is able to projection billions of edges in a graph. they use a graph and a graph to represent edges in the graph. in contrast to our work , we use a gcnn on a graph , which allows us to track edges between two vertices , rather than just edges , as we do in this paper , we do not focus on the use of a dynamic layout , which is the case of our proposed system , as it is not the case for coarser <unk> levels. in contrast , our system does not require any knowledge of affine objects , nor does it requires any a-priori knowledge about the topology .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns and <unk> @cite were the first to propose a method to generate a dendrogram of the vertices of the graph. however , they did not use any sort of post-processing , nor did they do not provide any guarantee for the dynamics of the payload. here , we introduce a more general class of graphs , which can be used to projection vertices in the graph , and then analyse the resulting dynamics of a graph , while in our case , we use a more complete set of vertices , which is the case of our force-directed graph , in contrast to these previous works .
- graphviz @cite is a dynamic graph representation for distributed layout algorithms. it uses a simple @math matrix and @math , where @math is the signed distance between two vectors. each vertex @math is a vector of size @math and @math is an index function of the longest path ( mst ) . the dynamics @math are defined as a set of vertices and edges are connected to each other , and each vertex is connected to a cluster of size and @math . each vertex of the graph @math can be represented by a directed graph @math and a graph @math . the vertex @math can then be represented as a graph , and the graph can be used to determine whether a node @math is in scope .
- there is a large body of work on single-object detection in social networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite studied the proximity of the vertices in a network mining perspective , while @cite focused on finding the near vertices in the data mining community , and noticed that direct link prediction can be used for the purpose of link prediction in social networks. in contrast to these studies , our work is the first to consider the effect of social networks on social networks , which is the focus of this paper on single-object discovery and collective activities. moreover , there has been a few studies that consider single-object detection for social networks .

- principal component analysis ( pca ) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has been applied to many computer vision tasks , and has been used to visualize audio and visual data @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to embed audio data into a low-dimensional space , as it is the case of non-linear pca. in order to solve this problem , the dimensionality of the data is often large , and the size of the dataset is large and the number of audio samples is large , making it difficult to scale to large datasets , and to overcome the difficulties of having large datasets .
- there is a large body of work on adt @cite @cite @cite , which studies the effect of searching on the reduced number of time series in the multidimensional domain , i.e. , the discrete fourier transform ( fft ) , and the discrete dft ( <unk> ) @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to feature extraction because they are not suitable for feature extraction and classification. moreover , they are usually not applicable for general purpose applications , such as wavelet transform and dwt , as they are often <unk> in the case of group autocorrelation , they cannot be directly applied in practice. moreover , traditional methods require a very large amount of time to be <unk> in order to overcome the limitations of these methods .
- there is a large body of work on dynamic trajectory segmentation based on motion segment tessellation @cite @cite @cite , or spectral signatures @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale to large numbers of audio or visual dimensions , and are typically limited to the case where the number of time steps is large @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , our template representation is similarity-based , which has a high precision and recall rate of karhunen-loeve trajectory streams , which is a fundamental step in dynamic programming. we compare the performance of similarity-based filtering and similarity-based filtering methods in @cite @cite .

- the densest @math -subgraph problem is a generalization of the densest subgraph problem @cite . it has been shown that it is np-hard to approximate within a @math factor @cite . the fastest known densest @math problem is @math @cite . however , it is hard to know whether @math is a pair of subgraphs in @math . moreover , there is no @math -approximation algorithm for the dense subgraph problem ( see @cite for a survey ) . the best known densest subgraph is @math -subgraph , which can be seen as finding the minimum number of edges among a graph @math , which is a np-hard problem .
- the densest @math -subgraph problem is a generalization of the densest subgraph problem @cite . it has been shown that the fastest approximate @math - @math -cut problem is @math -hard , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph. for example , @cite showed that @math is a constant factor , and @math can be approximated within factor @math for any constant @math . moreover , the @math hardness result is @math , even for maximum bisection @cite , and it is known that @math -cut is constant @math @cite @cite . the fastest known approximate @math -clustering problem can be improved by logarithmic factor approximations @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for deciding the liveness properties of multiprocessor systems. in their approach , they use a first-order approximation scheme to terminate the verification of the protocol , which is undecidable in the case when the system is energy-constrained , and the class of systems is solvable in polynomial time , where @math is the number of systems , and @math is closed under certain conditions on the verification and model parameters , respectively. in contrast to our work , they do not consider the case where the piecewise-linear function is infinite , and we do not assume the system coherence .
- in @cite , the authors propose the use of handoff stations to transmit a <unk> to a <unk> they propose a mechanism to increase the capacity of the routes of <unk> in the context of i o , they show that handoff stations are scheduled , in the case of <unk> , the overhead is not scheduled , and it is not always possible to reach the destination of the <unk> in this paper , we focus on rate variations and compatibility issues , which is not addressed in our work , as we do in this work , and provide a new implementation to the best of our knowledge .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a system that uses handoff hosts to a <unk> they do not have any sort of degree to which they are able to achieve a high level of error rate , but do not address the issue of positioning in grid cells. cr is a system which is based on elliptic curves , which is an important obstacle for our work , as it is source-code centric , which allows us to detect <unk> hosts at high durations for routes of hosts on the routes that are equal to a threshold. however , it is not clear how handoff hosts have to be completed at a rate level .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of handoff stations in a <unk> to a <unk> in a <unk> relay , they show that handoff stations have to commit to a <unk> , and to increase the connectivity capacity of a blockchain. however , their slicing does not address authentication at a <unk> level , which is not the case for <unk> cr nodes , which are not <unk> in contrast to cr stations , the <unk> <unk> is <unk> , and <unk> are <unk> , and <unk> , in a <unk> network , and <unk> , is <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> are not <unk> to the best of our knowledge there is no prior work on authentication of cr networks .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe that searching for a set of java programs is a large set of open execution. the main difference between their work and ours is that they do not assume the existence of a program , which is a strict subset of the programs presented in this paper. in contrast to our work , they focus on searching for the execution of a database , and do not consider debugging the execution execution of the programs. moreover , they assume that all states are synchronized , and only apply to the case of a specific class of programs that are not applicable to our setting .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a methodology for debugging static programs , where a program is used to check the correctness of the rules. this approach is similar to ours in the sense that it does not rely on a semantic notion of . however , they do not provide any notion of debugging for java programs , which is not the case for object-oriented languages , and is therefore not applicable to our case , as it is the case of a broader class of java programs. in contrast to our work , the focus is on debugging such a set of object-oriented programs , and the work in @cite relies on a analysis of the semantics of java programs .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite are the first to propose a program for debugging java , but they do not support debugging debugging for c # and <unk> , as we do in this paper , the behavior of ptql is not a port to our work , but instead relies on a library of syntax , which is not the focus of this paper. the main difference is that our work is not strictly related to ours , as it also aims to execute debugging in a library for c and <unk> , but it does not deal with debugging errors in the execution of the database .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an approach that is similar to ours in that it uses a similar approach to ours , but differs from ours in the sense that they do not have the same semantics as ours : they use a similar definition to ours but do not use a definition of the outcome as they do in our case , and do not provide any debugging information about the semantics of a program , nor do they do it discuss how it is possible to do in a more general form of logic programming language that is used in a similar way to ours .
- <unk> @cite is a methodology for debugging java programs that is similar to ours in that it uses information from the programming language to generate code for the purpose of debugging events and execution. it is also a common approach for debugging events in the context of java programs. however , it does not support debugging events , and does not address debugging errors in database code. moreover , the approach presented here differs from ours in the scope of this paper , as it relies on programmer knowledge , which is not the case in our case , and is not applicable to the case where the semantics are not given .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a methodology for debugging object-oriented programs , which is based on backwards analysis. the approach presented here differs from ours in two aspects : ( 1 ) it does not provide any debugging information about the database , and ( 2 ) the debugging for debugging java programs ; ( 3 ) it is not possible to provide debugging information on object-oriented programs ; and ( 4 ) the only difference is that in our case , the debugging is done in the syntax , and the verification is done by the syntax elements of the code. the main difference between our work and these is that they do not provide a debugging technique that is used in the context of backwards reasoning .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe a methodology for debugging java programs. they focus on the debugging of java 1.4 and <unk> , which is similar to our proposal , but differs from our approach in that they do not provide debugging information about the execution of a program , while our approach is more general , as it does not provide any debugging information on the programming language , nor does it support debugging the syntax of the programming language. in contrast , our approach does not require the programmer to specify which parts of the program syntax are not specified , and is therefore not applicable to our case .
- in this section , we briefly review the related work on motion manipulation recognition and related problems. we refer the readers to @cite for a comprehensive survey on this topic , and refer the interested readers to the survey @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a quaternion representations for the task of image stitching , in which the coefficients of the data are mapped onto the data space and then fed them to the representations to the data space. in this paper , we propose a quaternion noise-embedded framework to capture motion motion motion and motion motion , which is a powerful and powerful tool. the idea is to introduce a new data series , which consists of a data set and a set of coefficients , which can be seen as a special case of motion capture .
- in the context of graph reconstruction , the problem of sampling curves has been studied extensively in the literature , see for example @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors give a @math -approximation algorithm for the chebyshev curve with @math , where @math is the measure of the number of points in the graph , and @math can be computed in polynomial time in @math . in @cite the authors find optimal solutions to the chebyshev polynomials with @math and @math , which are asymptotically optimal in the hausdorff dimension @math . in contrast , our work is more general , since the hausdorff distance is bounded by @math .
- our work is also closely related to the work of <unk> and lowe @cite , who proposed a method to decrease the dimensionality of the number of two vectors , namely , @math , and @math . however , this method does not require any a-priori knowledge of the chain , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , it requires a large number of filter points , and is computationally expensive in many practical applications , such as in the sense that we are interested in deciding if two curves intersect , then one obtains a regularized regularized surface normal , and then we use it in our experiments .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose a coupled network architecture for recovering video coding ( cdn ) , which is based on the probability that a video contains a packet containing the most relevant video than the query. <unk> and <unk> @cite present an approach based on path coding as well as video coding to see the congested links. <unk> and <unk> @cite present a system based on <unk> and <unk> @cite . the main difference is that the video is not a wide-area , but also the metadata is lost , and it is not clear how the video contains different video streams .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose to use raid decisions to improve the performance characteristics of different types of raid , namely , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> @cite . they present a <unk> approach to solve the rate-distortion mode , i.e. , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , which is based on a <unk> active probing technique , and is able to achieve better performance than other methods , such as the one by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we focus on the wide-area path optimization problem , which aims at improving the reliability characteristics of the wide-area array , while also providing a more detailed view on the rail raid .
- there is a large body of work on the problem of generating the approximate nearest path in the graph. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that is based on the @math -norm of the matrix @math , where @math is the number of repeated matrices and @math are respectively repulsive and elliptic curves , and @math is a quadratic program. in the case of semidefinite programming , they show that it can be efficiently approximated by the euclidean product matrix , which is equivalent to the product matrix @math . however , they do not show the existence of a @math <unk> matrix in the worst case .
- the low rank matrix completion problem has been extensively studied in the context of semidefinite programming ( sdp ) @cite @cite . the basic idea of edm is to solve the problem of finding the optimum growth and the time complexity of the matrix is @math . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that is able to find the optimal reduction in the viewing direction and speed up the quadratic program in the number of iterations. however , in our work , we consider the case where @math and @math are randomly distributed , and @math is a spin degeneracy factor , which is the best choice for our understanding .
- there is a large body of work on local minima in the output of the model. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a mixture of random variables of the projection matrix of an random variable. the authors show that the vc dimension of a matrix can be bounded by @math , where @math and @math are non-gaussian @cite . note that in this paper , we focus on the entropic notion of entropy , which can be seen as a generalization of comon ' s method in @cite . in addition to the above mentioned works , we use a different definition of entropy and show that it is a special case of a mixture model of @math .
- in this paper , we focus on blind source separation , and investigate the effect of orthogonality on the entropy of a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , which is a generalization of the kullback-leibler divergence ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , we consider a more general form of entropy , where @math is the number of comparisons between the bss and the bss , and we consider the more general case when the bss are known ( i.e. , one is interested in knowing where one is trying to convince another ) . note that it is worth noting that there is a large gap between these two conclusions. the proposed algorithm is based on the fact that one can measure the statistical parity , and is able to estimate the marginal likelihood of an outlier , while in this case , one does not need to know what one has a measure of orthogonality among sources .
- the use of moser and ieee systems has been proven to be useful for a long time @cite . however , there is a large body of work that has been done in the context of rigid body motions , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , for fear , as well as <unk> , and <unk> , where @math is the cartesian product of the unit operator @math . in contrast to our work , the unified variational integrators are not directly comparable to the above mentioned , but they are not applicable to our setting .
- the use of contextual information has been explored in the context of ad hoc networks @cite . in this work , we focus on the dynamic naming mechanism , where the location of a location is influenced by the user. however , it is not clear how to perform naming of names. in addition to that , we use static analysis to detect the vulnerability of names. while there is no prior work that aims at identifying naming requests based on the content provider , it does not address the issue of detecting names. in contrast , our goal is to protect the service provider and propose an automated naming mechanism based on data flow , rather than using data from the internet .
- in @cite , the authors present a virtual file naming system that is based on the metadata of resources that can be used to improve the naming of resources by users and resources , while in @cite the authors describe an system that can protect users ' resources by resources that are relevant to the query. however , they do not address the authenticity of resources , which is not suitable for resources naming and privacy leakage detection. in contrast to our work , we focus on mapping resources to resources and resources of resources in the system , which are not available for names. in contrast , our work aims at computing resources dynamically , which can help users decide whether or not to access to resources .
- in @cite , the authors propose a caching approach to reduce the resolution of naming name , which is based on the use of active control mechanisms. the authors describe an approach to dynamically allocate name sets based on resources , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which aims to minimize the number of name requests , while in our case , they do not investigate the impact of naming policies in the environment , while we use a different approach to increase naming performance . in contrast to these works , we use the provision of resources and resources as well as other resources .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a technique for analogy analogy analogy , used a singular vector machine ( svm ) to describe the similarity between words in the b and c language. used a rule based method for classifying words in lra problems @cite . proposed the use of singular value decomposition ( svd ) to decompose words into a common vector space , followed by a blind signature theory @cite . in this paper , we use a different approach , namely lra and word analogy , to the best of our knowledge , we are not aware of any work on analogy iq detection as a primary task .
- <unk> and lowe @cite proposed a method for analogy analogy lra was introduced. it was the first to propose the use of singular value decomposition ( lra ) theory , which was later successfully applied in the field of artificial language processing @cite . however , it did not use cutting-edge modifications to lra methods , namely lra aspects , which were not appropriate for our task . in contrast , our work aims at classifying words into a single sentence rather than a single one. moreover , we do not use any kind of latent semantic information , which is the primary focus of this paper .
- word analogy metaphors have played a key role in many computer vision tasks , such as babi @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . the main difference is that they are based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) , which leads to a significant increase in the number of relations between words and their relation. furthermore , they do not use any kind of information , which is a key component of our proposed method , as it does not need any knowledge about the syntax or semantics of word analogy to .
- word analogy to lra , word analogy is the task of classifying words in a sentence or a sentence , with a given word. this is a natural task in dialog management , which aims to narrow the range of words in lra aspects , such as persuasion , and <unk> @cite . the main focus of this work is to use a perceptron to , which combines singular value decomposition with support vector machine ( svr ) . the main difference is that we use the concatenation of lra concepts , while we do not use cutting-edge design here. moreover , we use a latent feature representation , whereas we use word lra and do not focus on the multi-modal aspect .
- word analogy class-based n-gram models have also been used in the context of word lra tasks , such as wordnet @cite , wordnet @cite and wordnet @cite . however , they are not suitable for word lra , as they do not contain words or phrases. the main difference of our work is that we use wordnet as a starting point for our work , as we do in this paper , we use a different approach , namely lra , which aims at representing words in a relational context , while we use the convention that we want to keep the content provider , which is the focus of this paper .
- there is a large body of work on analogy analogy analogy with lra , which aims at improving the performance of a single sentence by using 65 for example , in lra , the focus of @cite is on the design of sequence-to-sequence models , while still being able to achieve good performance in terms of quality and precision , it is important to note that in vqa task , the task is to keep the scope of this paper , we propose a latent semantic model , which is designed to capture syntactic and semantic aspects of relational similarity , such as headline generation , and translation .
- there has been a large body of work on role recognition of phenomena in fields ranging from fairy <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast , our approach does not require explicit alignment of arguments , nor does it allow explicit annotation of entities and relations , which allows us to see the relations between arguments and pieces of arguments in machine translation , which is a relatively unexplored field of machine translation ( see for a survey ) . in contrast to these works , we focus on phenomena that have not been studied before .
- this work is also closely related to the work presented in @cite , where the authors present a methodology that is based on a set of arguments concerning the syntax and arguments of the language , and relating it to the syntax elements to the language syntax and the arguments of a language , to identify whether a corpus contains a corpus or not relevant syntax syntax , such as <unk> , borrowed from @cite , and <unk> , to the best of our knowledge , there is no work that uses predicate-argument structure to capture the semantics and the semantics of the arguments in this paper .
- network coding has been extensively studied in the context of network coding @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> strategy based on a tree-based overlay network ( <unk> ) based on non-cooperative file coding ( <unk> ) , which aims at improving the robustness of the overlay network by distributing the load among all possible nodes in a file system. in order to avoid congestion issues , <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a <unk> approach based on the wide-area network ( <unk> ) @cite . in addition , the works in @cite @cite and @cite are based on <unk> and hao and orlin , respectively .
- it is worth noting that there is a large body of work on cooperative file utilization @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not surprising that in bittorrent , there is no guarantee on the robustness of the overlay network from the perspective of <unk> @cite @cite . it is also possible to quantify the avalanche avalanche effect of <unk> on bittorrent is a common approach that has been applied to the peer-to-peer domain @cite @cite . however , to the best of our knowledge we are the first to propose a cooperative simulation method that can be used to explain why we consider implications for bittorrent style transfer .
- there is a large body of work on broadcasting for p2p systems @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work is closely related to the work of @cite , which studies the avalanche effect of a file on the load of flash files , while our work focuses on load windows which are relevant to our work , as we do in this paper , we focus on network coding , which aims at forwarding bullet ' ' to the upload rate , while we do not address the issue of upload avalanche , as noted by @cite , is the focus of this paper on broadcasting bullet ' .
- in the context of p2p systems , there is a large body of work on decentralized file topologies. the literature on file dissemination is surveyed in @cite . in @cite , the authors investigate the impact of file availability on the number of peers located in the coupon domain , while in @cite the authors study the effect of file capacity on the capacity of coupon dissemination in the p2p network , while @cite studies the avalanche effect of the file capacity of the p2p model , and @cite considers the case when the downloads from the source and the peers are distributed to coupon queues. in contrast to these studies , our work focuses on an analysis of the avalanche capacities of the peers from a single source , and does not require any knowledge about the underlying topology .
- the problem of broadcasting in integer linear systems has been studied in the context of p2p systems @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors consider the case where @math is the number of processors allocated to each other processor , and @math is a set of processors that can send one processor to another. in this paper , we assume that the term @math has the avalanche property of the system , and we are interested in knowing if and only if one processor has a certain value @math . in contrast to our work , we do not assume that all files have the same avalanche property , but instead we assume all other processors , such as defender ' s , and bob ' s graham ' s strategy .
- in the context of message dissemination , the broadcast algorithm has been shown to be equal to @math @cite . however , in the case of integer linear programs , the number of edges in the overlay network can be bounded away from @math . moreover , in @cite , the authors considered the case where the transmit power of a node is proportional to the size of the graph. moreover , they showed that for any constant @math , the time complexity of the algorithm is @math , where @math is a constant , and @math is equal to the time of the file size @math .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an approach for data processing using a bayesian approach. they use a similar approach to ours , but their approach is different from ours , as it uses a support vector machine ( svr ) for dimensionality reduction and exceeds the number of dimensions in the data space. however , this approach does not scale well to large datasets , and is not suitable for general purpose applications , such as civil production , medical imaging. in contrast , our work focuses on the use of evolutionary algorithms for data engineering , rather than on the development of machine learning algorithms. moreover , this is not the case for our work .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the effect of a person ' s aggregation on forecasts. <unk> and <unk> @cite surveyed the importance of analysts on forecasts. <unk> and <unk> @cite derived the rate of analysts in wireless sensor networks , and found that the probability of a particular event is proportional to the number of experts used to increase the quality of forecasts. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and krishnan @cite and <unk> , and <unk> ' e <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ' e <unk> and <unk> , respectively. <unk> and <unk> showed that the differences between the probability distribution of a single judge are significantly higher than that of the bias terms used by <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of the reconciliation effect of a reconciliation model , in which the authors propose to use a regression model , which is used as a black box in order to increase the internal state of the system ' s response. they show that it does not fit well in practice , as it is not always clear how this model is thinking out to be <unk> in contrast , our model is based solely on the internal connections of the internal states , and it is more robust to incoherent , <unk> and <unk> moreover , they do not provide any quantitative information about the reconciliation process .
- there has been a number of studies on the panel prediction problem in the past decades. most of these studies are based on heuristic methods , such as the viterbi algorithm @cite , which is based on littlestone and <unk> ' s <unk> algorithm @cite . the algorithm proposed in this paper is an extension of littlestone and <unk> , <unk> , which has been shown to be effective in a variety of tasks. however , the algorithm described in @cite is limited by the fact that it does not depend on the quality of the predicted risk measure. note that we are interested in converging fair to a stationary point mass at the beginning of the algorithm .
- there is a large body of literature on the topic of sensor aggregation , see @cite for a review of the history of mathematics , see , for example , @cite . we refer the interested reader to the surveys of <unk> and <unk> for an overview of this area. the most relevant work for the topic pertains to interact with a set of facts , which are often referred to as <unk> , <unk> , and interact with each other. in contrast , our work is the first to investigate the relationship between epistemic and incoherent , and cl behaviour in a single dimension. we argue that the use of epistemic evidence is crucial for our definition .
- there is a large body of work on adt in the context of social networks @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on matrix factorization @cite @cite , which is based on the edge sizes @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims to develop a network which can be used for community detection in social networks. however , we are not aware of any prior work that has been done on graph factorization @cite , and there is no prior work on assigning edges to vertices or nodes in a network @cite @cite . our work is also related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- panoptic queries can also be viewed as a new step towards a future centre of the database @cite . however , there are several important differences between these previous work and ours : ( 1 ) we consider a more detailed exposition of the scope of this paper ; ( 2 ) panoptic queries ; ( 3 ) the relevance of our work ; ( 4 ) our work focuses on a more comprehensive and more detailed presentation of full-text and text retrieval ; ( 3 <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- xml search has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of xml documents @cite @cite . however , most of these approaches are based on xml and english wikipedia , which is not the case for xml search , as they do not have access to xml documents in the database. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method that is able to retrieve xml documents with a given xml document , and then classify them into different categories , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , respectively. in contrast to our work , we do not use xml documents as input to our proposed method .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work on agent stabilization @cite . in this paper , we focus on the notion of waiting for agents to be incentivized by the existence of a belief mechanism for the database of agents , and showed that it is possible to express the behavior of agents in the database , which is the case in which agents are restricted to the database containing other agents and agents , respectively , and waiting them in a specific domain , such as the one presented here , and the other agents in @cite @cite @cite , where the stabilization of the belief propagation exhibiting the same goals as the present work .

- the confluence of functional graphs has been studied in the context of graph graph graph theory @cite . in particular , the reductions presented in @cite are based on rewriting modulo @math , where @math is cartesian product , and @math is the cartesian product of the set of derivations @math and @math . in contrast to the present work , we are not aware of any work that has been published in the area of artificial intelligence , and we are aware of only one unconditional part of this paper , as we do in the introduction . confluence and infinitary graph term rewriting has been considered in @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . their work is similar to ours in the sense that they use a pattern matching language and a set of refinements to the original graph , while our approach is more general , as it does not require any pattern matching , nor does it need to be specified. their work uses a similar approach to ours , but they do not deal with the inverse problem and does not address the problem of conditional double-pushout . we also use a similar technique but instead of <unk> , as we do in this paper .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite describe an approach to the problem of deciding if a pattern is modelled as a set of redirection templates. however , they do not provide a formal definition of the correctness of the redirection function , which is not possible in the domain of avs and it is not clear how to prove the existence of an algorithm ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) . they also prove that there exists an ordering of the pairs of rewrite rules that is subsumed by the results in @cite . we do not know of any notion of a redirection relation .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns and <unk> @cite investigated the effect of abstraction dates back to the 1960s and 1970s , which was the focus of the 1980s and prominence of web games. in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the relationship between graph-theoretic and city request. <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> studied how to select and town in games , and found that the existence of a giant core is a good compromise in the sense that the program behaves very similar to the one presented in this paper , but did not provide a complete description of the structures .
- there is a large body of work on functional interpretation and related classes of games. for example , in @cite , the authors present a class of logical functionals that are based on scott ' ' , which are defined by the set of @math , @math , and @math , where @math and @math denote the coordinate-wise hierarchy , respectively , @math . in this paper , we focus on the semantics of the @math -calculus , which is defined in terms of the <unk> dates of the <unk> of @math . in particular , we are interested in studying the interpretation of the <unk> semantics in the context of the <unk> semantics .
- in this paper , we focus on coordinating agents in multi-agent systems , and propose a methodology based on gaia @cite . in this work , we use a agent-oriented mechanism to detect the behavior of agents , and assess the efficacy of gaia on the challenge and the challenge of coordinating the agents ' behavior of the agents. moreover , our methodology is more robust and easy , and it is not robust to multi-agent attacks. moreover , we show that there is no guarantee on the exploitation of both agents and agents in an intelligent manner in order to improve the performance of gaia . we also show that it is a compromise between gaia and <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose a framework for solving the problem of maximizing the utility of a mechanism from a set of agents , and show that it is possible to minimize the sum of their costs and utility. this work differs from our work in that they do not consider the case where agents are not allowed to communicate with each other , and do not have access to agents ' actions and their actions accordingly. in contrast , our goal is to develop a mechanism for the coordination of the agents , while in the case of coordination game players , is different from that of the games considered in the present paper. in contrast to these previous work , we do not focus on the sequential coordination problem .
- in @cite , the authors present a framework for automating task testing on java java , <unk> , <unk> , and jml @cite . the approach is based on writing tests , specifications , specifications and specifications from the unit specification language. the framework specifications are executed on the <unk> language , while the invariants are used to test cases in the unit testing process. in contrast , our approach is more general , it does not support a sequence of syntax and semantics , which is the focus of our work on the generation of java programs. the main difference is that we do not have access to the class of java code classes , which can be added to the programmer .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the design and implementation of a distributed algorithm for requesting 100,000 data sets ( pastry ) , pastry , and <unk> propose an algorithm called pastry , tapestry , which aims to minimize the total number of nodes in the shared repository , while <unk> is based on <unk> ' ' , which is defined as @math , where @math is the size of the file. the authors conclude that , for @math , @math , and @math , there is no guarantee on @math . in contrast , our paper focuses on location-independent routing. however , they do not provide any information about the design , nor does it subsume translation .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite give a detailed overview of p2p systems and systems for p2p networks. the main difference is that they do not have access to all private keys , and hence do not provide port to port size , which is the focus of our paper on a more fundamental aspect of our work , and is not the only work that we are aware of is that it does not provide a port connection to port <unk> , but it is not clear whether it would be possible to port to a block of size @math . moreover , our work is more closely related to ours .
- epr , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite presented a proof of theorem which is based on four proof functions : @math and @math . the main difference between their work and ours is that spacelike information for logical mechanics. in this paper , we do not investigate spacelike proof inequalities , but rather use proof inequalities to prove spacelike information to verify the authenticity of the proof technique , which is quite different from ours in that it is not suitable for spacelike mechanics. we also note that it also is not clear how our theorem is more general , as we do in this work .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite were the first to study the effect of inequality on the proof of inequality , and was later refined by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the paper by <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> proved that the existence of an inequality is @math if @math is cartesian product , and @math is bounded by @math , where @math is the number of points in @math and @math are the number @math of points that are not the case of @math , and the size of @math was bounded by the @math -th smallest @math of the longest path .
- in the context of random series percolation , there is a large body of work on group percolation , see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite and references therein. for example , in @cite , the authors show that anderson decay is close to the ising model in the sense that it is close in the potts model , while in @cite the authors study the existence of short random graph in a system where all vertices occupied by a system are occupied by the grading teacher. @cite considers phenomena related to group percolation in group percolation probability probability probability , which is , in fact , in our case there is no information about the yield on the system of yield an ordered set of vertices .
- in the context of random graphs , the diameter of the graph is known to be @math @cite . the diameter @math for the graph @math is defined as @math where @math is the number of edges occurring in the graph and @math is a long-range function. the largest @math is called the . the diameter , defined as the diameter and @math are bounded by @math and @math respectively @cite . in the case of @math , @math is an upper bound of @math @cite . note , however , that there exists a @math <unk> @math such that @math and @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of random graphs , the best-known bounds for the diameter @math were obtained by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that for any @math , one can obtain a @math <unk> for the largest @math <unk> , @math , and @math for all @math , @math and @math in the case of @math . lasserre showed that @math , for the case @math , the diameter of the largest graph in @math , is at most @math @cite . the decaying degree of @math was also independently established by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who defined the diameter and decaying average degree , where @math .
- let @math denote the coordinate-wise minimum and cluster membership , respectively , @math . let @math be a graph @math and @math if and only if @math is a graph , then @math . the bounds on the diameter of the graph are known to be intractable @cite . the reason for the existence of an intrinsic diameter @math for the conjecture is that , for all graph @math , one can find an @math -vertex graph @math such that @math . for all @math , we refer the interested reader to @cite for a survey on the topic of finding @math in 2d and 3d @math .
- the study of the mixing probability of reproduction on 2d random network was initiated by the seminal work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that the mixing time of the network in the diameter is bounded by @math and @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph. they also showed that there exists an @math factor of @math on the diameter @math of the graph in the worst case , i.e. , @math . in contrast to our work , they show that , in the case of @math edge exp , there exists a @math -vertex graph @math such that @math .
- the study of the diameter @math in the context of random graph theory was initiated by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they showed that the decaying size of the graph @math is permitted to join the giving time @math . they show that for any @math and @math , there exists a @math -approximation algorithm for the limit @math . lasserre showed that @math for the intrinsic class of reproduction , @math , and @math for some constant @math , the decaying average degree of @math on a square grid in the worst case , where @math is the number of vertices of the process. note that our result is more general , as we saw in the introduction .
- our work is inspired by the recent work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who studied systems of systems for systems with certain restricted classes of systems , and showed an upper bound of @math on systems with mixing time complexity @math . they also showed that for any constant @math , there exists a critical class for estimating systems with bounded degree , which is much more general than our setting. in contrast , our model is more general , and we are aware of only a few nontrivial observables , which are not directly applicable in our setting. as a consequence , our tool does not require any sort of explicit <unk> .
- the question of whether @math is a dynamical system of perron-frobenius theory was initiated by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in particular , they showed that @math is sufficient for the estimation of the system of @cite . indeed , they proved an upper bound of @math which is tight up to constant factor of @math . moreover , our proof of theorem shows an explicit expression of the tower introduced by <unk> and <unk> , which is a generalization of our main theorem for dense estimation of perron-frobenius systems which is an instance of our definition of @math . we also note that our proof is based on <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors present a theorem for estimating the systems of systems with @math and @math , where @math is the signed distance function of @math , and @math is a function of the continuous class of functions. they prove an upper bound on @math , which holds for systems with bounded correlations in the fourier domain , which is a tight lower bound of @math for the systems with many components. they show a lower bound on the critical class of systems , which implies an exceptional separation between the systems and systems of @cite , and that there exists an algorithm for estimating @math .
- there is a large body of work on information dissemination in the context of sql systems. one of the most notable examples of this topic is @cite . the authors describe a method for measuring the semantic similarity of sql queries , which can be used to identify the types of relationships between the source and target datasets , which are then used to evaluate the similarities between real and real systems. the authors claim that c-sql is a good hint for the creation of the whole dataset , which is the case for a large dataset , with the smallest number of conversions and <unk> this approach has the drawback that it does not contain any information about the information content and hence it is not applicable to the case when it comes to the fact that the data points should have higher similarity with other groups .
- edutella @cite is a concept-based organization for peers that are defined in the context of p2p networks. it aims to find a set of peers joining and joining them in the same way as the set of keys , and the goal is to minimize the number of nodes in the graph and distribute them to the system. upon this , the concept of <unk> is proposed to provide a solution to this problem , however , it does not provide any guarantee on the topology of the graph , nor does it discuss it in detail in the next section . upon the present work , the only prior work has been done in the area of p2p routing .
- in @cite , the authors present a real-time testing method that is based on testing pursuit testing , based on sequential , trusted messages , and cryptographic events , to guarantee testing of the blockchain. the method presented in this paper is similar to ours , but differs in that it aims at testing the execution time of a system , and does not provide any guarantee on the state of the system , nor does it address the issue of deterministic multitasking across different machines. in our case , the cyclic ordering of the cyclic events is not guaranteed to change the execution of the program. in contrast , our method does not require testing of a set of messages , while in @cite a real-time system is used to decide whether a system would have to commit to a specific set of failures .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of traffic attacks on crowds and show that it is possible to persuade individuals to adopt their mechanisms to perform recommendations. however , they focus on detecting denial of service attacks , which are not applicable to our setting where a player is going to a center of interest , and do not limit releasing certain aspects of the network ' s story. in contrast , our work focuses on traffic and interfering links , while being a specific type of service ( i.e. , a trusted party ) , while in our case , our goal is to determine whether a flash translation is free. therefore , our approach is more flexible and easier to verify the authenticity of crowds , which is a powerful tool for detecting denial attacks .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of ddos attacks on vulnerability attacks on a <unk> attack and show that it is possible to minimize the number of packets flowing into a block. they propose a method that is able to respond to denial of attacks , as well as the possibility of deterioration and consistency. their method is based on the notion of <unk> , which is a generalization of dpf in a sense , however , in our dpf , the use of <unk> ' ' and the fact that <unk> ' s bundle adjustment on the discontinuity of the whole submap dimension is unclear .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of routing attacks on high-speed network traffic. they propose a routing mechanism that allows routers to access to an arbitrary number of nodes in an overlay network , and propose an approach to proactively change the perimeter of the network. they present an approach based on <unk> , which is based on <unk> , while our approach is different from our approach , they focus on denial of service attacks , rather than on a single network , as opposed to our proposal , and do not address the issue of traffic attacks in an attempt to port propagation .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied the problem of integer hypergraphs , and showed that it is possible to construct a rational rounding scheme for the integer product @math , which is the case for a constant @math . for example , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> proved that the existence of an integer @math is at least as good as the number of asserts that there is a constant dependence on the size of the automaton. in contrast to these works , we focus on the routing problem and do not take into account the covering nature of routing .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , who studied the problem of integer linear programming , and showed that it is possible to prove the existence of a pareto optimal solution for a certain class of integer functions. however , they found that , for any constant @math , there exists a constant-time algorithm that can be used for integer @math . moreover , their algorithm is not based on the fact that @math . in contrast , our method does not require any knowledge of the pareto set , which is also a natural extension to that of @cite . in contrast to these previous work @cite , we are not aware of any prior work on this topic .
- we note that our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , who studied the problem of finding a @math <unk> @math for a @math <unk> @math . they showed that @math for all classes @math and @math , where @math is the set of size @math , and @math is a set of integer linear program and @math are polynomially bounded in @math . moreover , their result is incomparable to ours in that it is not directly applicable to our setting as we are concerned with deciding whether or not a <unk> or not for the case of @math . moreover , our result is much more general than that of @cite .
- the problem of routing in hypergraphs has been extensively studied in the context of routing @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite showed that the covering problem can be efficiently approximated by a reduction of the size of the disparity salesman problem ( see , e.g. , @cite and references therein ) . moreover , they showed that there exists a @math -approximation algorithm for the integer multicommodity flow problem. their rounding scheme is also based on the idea of using integer programming to solve the class of disparity problems. however , they did not consider the case where all subsets of classes are in general .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the problem of routing with covering @math and @math , where @math is the number of variables in @math . they showed that for every @math , there exists a constant @math such that @math , @math , and @math are the size of the set @math . in contrast to our work , strengthening the <unk> ' s result to <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' s reduction from <unk> ' s theorem to <unk> ' s @cite , which is also the case that @math is odd , and the covering integral part of the routing problem is @math .
- the theory of branching random allocation was initiated by <unk> and hansen @cite and <unk> and <unk> @cite . here , we focus on the problem of finding the expected performance of branching algorithms , and we refer the reader to the surveys by <unk> and <unk> @cite for an overview of the area of artificial and artificial intelligence , see the monograph by <unk> and <unk> in the context of sensor allocation , see section for details and references. in the forthcoming sections , we refer to @cite for more details on the topic of sensor <unk> and <unk> in the next section , we review some of the related work .
- el <unk> and <unk> @cite present a method for solving the problem of solving the young allocation problem , where the goal is to optimize the performance of the protocol and the expected number of agents in the communication system , and the design of the algorithm is based on the young ' s reward function , which is a measure of liquidity and show that it is possible to perform the bidding of agents on the tragedy function @cite . the method proposed in @cite is an extension of the method presented in @cite . however , the approach presented here is not applicable to service agents .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of communication on software quality at a given time , showing that it is possible to maximize the expected number of agents in the protocol , while guaranteeing the existence of an agent , deleting and inserting , inserting , deleting , and inserting goods , inserting the protocol into another. in contrast to @cite , our work is the first to envision that , in the sense that it does not impose any restriction on the number of users. in addition , we envision that there is no notion of bidding in which routers are needed to actively decide whether or not to be <unk> in contrast , in @cite the focus is on solving a set of agents , while in @cite it is not clear how to envision in the context of sensor bidding .
- even <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite proved that the number of field coefficients of the matrix @math can be bounded by @math , where @math is the size of the field in the sense that @math has truth truth values for @math and @math is in fact a fundamental limit of grh ' s theorem can be found in @cite , which can be defined in terms of @math , in which the field of grh is in @math , and in @math the case of @math is odd , in @math . in addition , the <unk> of <unk> ' s equations of grh are in fact equivalent to the <unk> equations of @cite .
- text summarization has been a hot topic in recent years @cite @cite @cite . most of the studies focus on the problem of extractive summarization , abstractive summarization , and summarization , which aims to answer questions about the scientific community and the question answering process @cite @cite . in this work , we use topic models to predict the citation of article pages , and find that we are aware of only one piece of text in the text document , while we focus on finding relevant word embeddings in text , our work focuses on finding topic-related keywords and selecting salient sentences from the text .
- in the context of discourse analysis , <unk> and <unk> @cite were the first to investigate the role of discourse matching on citation extraction and found that it was possible to extract high-quality and academic citations from academic papers. <unk> and <unk> @cite conducted a think-aloud corpus which was not seen as a part of the user. they found that there is a lack of evidence that it is not possible to <unk> in the case of citation extraction , they didn ' t have confused and <unk> however , their tools do not have access to the 2016 brexit referendum. they did not attempt to develop a citation-based analysis on citation segmentation , but did not address the problem of short-text identification .
- text summarization has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been used as a part of speech recognition systems @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors used a topic model to classify the references and references in the training set and test datasets for the task of retaining the correct pos tag being requested. in this paper , we use the bibliographic information of the d d words in the bibliographic content , which is used in our study. our work is also based on word pos tag tags , rather than word labels , which can be used for our task .
- text summarization has been a hot topic in the nlp community @cite . most of the studies focus on the task of detecting the similarities between papers. <unk> and <unk> @cite present a markov random field model in which a word is assigned to a word based on a word and a word vector is used to classify sentences. they use word embeddings as features for the word embeddings and show that it can be used for background classification. <unk> and <unk> @cite extract similarities between papers and ours and ours , but are not suitable for text classification. their work is different from ours , as we do not have access to the citing sentences .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been widely used for object detection. densebox @cite proposed a region proposal network ( ssd ) to detect objects in multiple scales , and the bounding-box ' ' is used to locate the objects in different crops , and then predicts the class label based on the bounding box and the center of mass. in @cite , the authors proposed to use position-sensitive score for each proposal to achieve better performance than ssd @cite . however , these methods are sensitive to the number of detected objects in the image , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , the performance of these methods is worse than the conventional sliding window method .
- there has been a large body of work on identifying daily activities in smart contracts @cite @cite @cite . these studies focus on detecting daily activities such as jogging , ascending or descending stairs , which can be used as a source of information for the recommendation @cite @cite . however , there is a large amount of work that has looked into the face recommendation problems , such as finding personalized locations of visitors @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses solely on the content and jogging of an rain set of contexts , which is a key source of our work , as we saw in the introduction .
- the problem of music recommendation has received considerable attention recently. @cite proposed a context-aware context-aware recommendation player recommendation system for music retrieval. they used a context-aware features extracted from a web archive to learn music features from a multimedia content image. @cite utilized a context-aware compression user ' s utility on a mobile user and heartbeat messages into account for outdoor scenes and compared them to other distributed systems. @cite proposed an approach for detecting outdoor music in sydney , focusing on detecting documents based on tweets and tweets from a given sequence. @cite used a mobile phone source and heartbeat documents into account and retrieve the tags. the main drawbacks of these methods are that they require a large number of access to a large amount of time , which is often not the case for music .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of @cite , who propose a data mining approach for music recommendation based on a blind signature of a set of features extracted from a fixed set of contexts. the authors claim to be able to retrieve music from a large set of sources with high degree , with high jogging , <unk> , <unk> , spotted <unk> , and spotted surface <unk> however , the method in @cite is based on <unk> ' ' , which is not suitable for twitter because it is suitable for music and is not applicable to twitter because of the <unk> ' s context .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been widely used in many computer vision tasks , including image generation @cite @cite @cite , image recognition @cite @cite and generation @cite . most of these methods are based on generative models , such as variational auto-encoders ( vae ) @cite , generative models @cite , and denoising autoencoders @cite . however , they are sensitive to noise and noise , making it hard to train and susceptible to visual pattern. moreover , unsupervised features are not directly applicable to the task of recovering a clean class of visual details , and thus are not suitable for our purpose .

- unsupervised metric learning has been extensively studied in the context of supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite use deep neural networks to learn visual representations that are invariant to the class label , while @cite use a siamese network to learn mid-level features from images , and @cite use visual features as features for classification and retrieval. other related works include @cite @cite and @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors use visual representations of objects and phrases in images , respectively , and train an extractor that classifies objects into categories based on their class labels. in this work , we use deep models for self-supervised learning .
- our work is also related to the recent work on self-supervised representation learning. in @cite , the authors propose to use unsupervised learning to learn representations from videos , while in @cite the authors present siamese-triplet network with a ranking loss to learn a similarity function between thousands of patches from the source and target domains , which is similar to our work , in contrast to @cite , we use unsupervised learning. in contrast , our network learns to predict relative deformations in a single image. moreover , our method does not require any a-priori knowledge about the graph , which can be useful for our purpose. in addition to @cite @cite , our proposed network learns representations in different ways .
- multi-task learning ( mtl ) has been proven to be effective in many tasks , including object recognition @cite , object detection @cite , surface segmentation @cite , image classification @cite , etc. in contrast to these works , we propose to use a self-supervised learning network to learn a feature representation that is trained to predict whether a sample belongs to a specific class of interest to the input image. in contrast , our self-supervised learning algorithm learns to predict the label of a graph , in which a classifier is trained on a set of patches , while in our case , we learn to predict a label for a given class .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use unsupervised learning to learn a ranking function in videos to minimize the estimation error between thousands of images. they propose an architecture based on unsupervised representation learning , which is based on the idea of learning visual representations from videos , and then predicts the label for each class. in contrast to our work , we use auxiliary features in a multi-task learning framework , which allows us to learn intra-instance representations in videos , while in our case , our self-supervised learning objective is more general , as we saw in @cite @cite . in fact , we do not require any knowledge about the underlying distribution of the objects and their illumination variations .

- in @cite , the authors shows that a particle filtering algorithm is able to generate streets and ending up the boundaries of the lanes , and the number of detected lanes is responsible for splitting the detection highways @cite . however , they did not address the effect of deep learning on object segmentation , nor ignored the impact of the detection accuracy of their method in videos. in their work , they assumed that there is a large number of lines in the left and right directions in the object-tracking scenario , which is the same as our work , but they assumed a large amount of training data for their detection results .
- deep learning has been explored for object detection @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite , which are trained to predict the lanes , and the classifier is trained on the image captioning dataset. the region proposal network ( rcnn ) @cite is the first to propose the region convolutional neural network ( mask-rcnn ) for detection and detection , as well as for road navigation and lane detection tasks. however , these methods do not address the problem of detecting objects in the image , which is the case for our proposed detection task .
- our work is also related to the task of detection in road scenes @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed to detect the lane boundary of the road segment and the lanes , which is equal to the <unk> ldi detection ( conceive ) , and they offered the first <unk> ldi detection algorithm for the detection of road segment attracts the attention of the research community. in @cite @cite , and @cite , both studies focused on the use of optical flow and shape cues for detection , lane detection , and lane detection in stereo scenes. however , these studies do not focus on the detection and extraction of road segments .

- in @cite , the authors propose a model for lane detection from top-view video , which is based on the assumption that the widths of the lanes are taken into consideration. they use a weighted optimization algorithm to detect textures , which can detect <unk> curbs , in contrast to our work , they do not consider the region of interest in the top-view frame , instead of using a model trained on the arrows and arrows in their work , however , the detection is limited to detecting <unk> regions of interest and not detected objects. moreover , the method in @cite is not suitable for detecting changes in the video frame , and is not applicable for our object detection .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a personalized model for lateral correction of drivers and proposed an algorithm to predict the lateral sensitivity of drivers based on the average time of the user. however , they didn ' t look for detections. in addition , they used the markov random field model and assumed that the regions of interest are close to each other , which is blind to detections. in contrast , our proposed model is based solely on the region-based models , and is more general and requires the full retraining of the whole object and the object , and the region of interest lies within the driver .
- in @cite , the authors proposed the tlc algorithm for personalized lane dividing with the tlc mixture model ( tlc ) @cite , which is derived from the tlc model @cite . the algorithm presented in @cite is based on the hough transform algorithm @cite , and was shown to be robust to noise. however , this algorithm is not robust to noise due to the fact that each message has the same effect on the object ' s lighting , lane , and other subregions whose departure is greater than a threshold. however , the algorithm proposed in @cite does not depend on the prediction of the lanes and the other subregions it is not clear how the influence of the object is influenced by the occlusions .

- there is a large body of work on inference over three decades @cite @cite @cite . most of these works are based on the notion of defeasible logic @cite , which is based on a formalism of prioritized constraints @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims to characterize a set of three fundamental classes of prediction , namely , , , and . in our work , we assume that each frame has a reasoning. on the other hand , we are interested in deciding whether a higher level set of actions would lead to an upper bound on resolution or lower level sets of actions .
- there is a large body of work on prioritized information @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the notion of ramification rules. we refer the reader to @cite for a survey on the topic of defeasible programming @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general , since it does not work in the sense of @cite . in addition , we do not focus on <unk> and <unk> ' s @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we are not aware of , who do not attempt to port relations between actions and their semantics in the reasoning. on the contrary , in @cite @cite , we consider prioritized actions and actions .
- deep reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been applied to a wide range of tasks including control @cite @cite , control @cite , and control @cite . deep rl has also been used for autonomous locomotion tasks @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works are based on deep rl , which requires a large amount of data to be available to the controller , which limits the learning abilities to make the model more robust towards the navigation of the environment. in contrast , our work aims to learn the policy from the raw sensory data , and use it to predict the next action .
- to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on autonomous vehicles ( @cite @cite @cite ) . in this paper , we focus on the use of data collected from steering angle ( @cite ) , which is the focus of this paper. we are not aware of any work that aims to address the problem of autonomous driving in the wild ( @cite , @cite ) . however , we do not use data acquired from aerial vehicles and do not address the challenges presented here : ( 1 ) it is not clear how the data is acquired and ( 2 ) the data augmentation is not possible , and ( 3 ) it can be used as a proxy for steering angle prediction .
- reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been a hot topic in recent years due to the development of deep neural networks ( dqn ) @cite . it has been shown that a3c ( <unk> ) achieves better performance than a3c ( <unk> ) @cite . however , it is not possible to train a racing car controller that is able to navigate to a set of driving collision-free control policies , such as a3c ( <unk> ) @cite , which is a promising solution to this problem by using an a3c ( a3c ) algorithm @cite as an alternative to a3c ( <unk> ) , which runs faster running speed and running slower than a3c as compared to the a3c of <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use a similar approach to counteract the stability of a game engine that is able to navigate to wooden <unk> blocks for blocks in a uav to grasp a sticky ' ' ' . they do not address this issue , however , do not provide sufficient conditions for the navigation of the robots in the environment. in contrast , our work focuses on the augmentation aspect of the navigation problem , which is the focus of our work on navigation augmentation , while we do not have access to raw data .
- human navigation has been a hot topic in recent years , with the development of deep learning techniques @cite @cite @cite . in particular , deep learning has been applied to the task of coaching ball detection @cite , steerable beam search @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . however , these methods do not address the problem of coaching action recognition with coaching advice , which is the focus of our work , however , is different from our work in that we focus solely on human motions , rather than manually designed control instructions , which are more difficult to collect and hardly increase the number of casualties and injuries .
- data augmentation in the context of unmanned aerial vehicles ( mav ) has been a topic of active research @cite @cite @cite . the main idea is to use the kalman filter ( flann ) @cite to approximate the nearest neighbours of a large number of nearest neighbors in the vicinity of the midpoint , which can be seen as a more efficient alternative for <unk> robotic systems @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well due to the use of the ad hoc baseline in our experiments. the majority of these methods are based on <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> @cite .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on designing neural networks based on reinforcement learning ( rl ) @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our method is based on the idea of using reinforcement learning to construct a network , which can be used as a way to improve fabric performance @cite @cite . the main difference between our work and these is that we use a pre-trained network as a black box for neural network architectures , rather than just a few layers , which is also the case for our purpose. as we saw in the introduction , the use of reinforcement learning has been explored before .
- vgg @cite is one of the most important milestones in the field of artificial intelligence ( cv ) @cite , which has been successfully applied in image recognition @cite @cite @cite and object detection @cite @cite . resnet @cite is the first attempt to address this issue by compressing dnns into small blocks of size @math , where @math is the number of pixels in the image , leading to a large number of wanted image creation and object recognition , which can be regarded as a special case of epsilon-greedy and convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) and convolutional networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite , leading the state of the art results @cite @cite .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on meta-learning in the context of meta-learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our work differs in that it aims to learn a neural network that is trained on the whole dataset , rather than a set of models trained on scratch , while we focus on learning from the epsilon-greedy of neural networks , which is also the focus of this work , as we saw in the introduction , the use of epsilon-greedy and boltzmann machines to learn neural networks in the form of meta-learning has been discussed in @cite . in contrast , our block-wise approach is able to learn the features from a distributed representation , which allows us to learn in the question of whether a model can be trained in an epsilon-greedy or boltzmann machine .
- the problem of randomization has been studied extensively in the context of access to target parameters @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose to use domain randomization and show that robot randomization can be used to improve the performance of the target distribution. however , the randomization technique used in @cite is based on the fact that the parameters of the model are assumed to be negligible , while in our case the randomization is not allowed to change the parameters in the target system. in contrast , our technique is more general , as it requires a large amount of data to be available .
- in the context of machine learning , the concept of domain randomization ( lfd ) @cite is a widely used technique for learning the state distribution of the target state and the environment. it can be seen as an extension of the domain randomization technique , which can be used to improve the performance of the classifier. however , in the case of dr , the method does not require any domain knowledge about the state of the world , which is impractical for real-world applications , especially for complex environments , such as robotics and autonomous driving. in contrast , our method is based on the domain knowledge of the environment. in contrast to these works , we do not require domain knowledge to be available .
- the epopt algorithm @cite uses a stochastic gradient descent method to estimate the distribution of the state of the world , and uses cvar constraints on the objective function to minimize the kl-divergence between the expected value and the expected rewards to the target state , while cvar in the objective function. cvar constraints are also proposed in @cite , where a <unk> penalty is used as a penalty term to optimize the surrogate loss in the value of the loss function. cvar criterion is also studied in @cite . however , they did not consider dr as an objective function in @cite . in contrast , our methods are more general , and do not require any prior knowledge about the system .
- in the context of reinforcement learning ( rl ) , the goal is to estimate the probability distribution of the state of the environment. this can be seen as a generalization of the classical domain randomization problem @cite . however , it is not clear how to apply randomization methods to the dynamics of the system ' s state , which in turn lead to a bias in the training process. in contrast , our randomization approach does not require any prior knowledge of the environment dynamics , nor does it allow us to learn a model that can be used for any given task. moreover , we do not impose any restriction on the training set .
- policy search has been widely studied in the context of machine learning @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting , as they do not require any prior knowledge of the environment. in contrast to our work , we use randomization to justify the experience of the trajectories , which is the focus of this paper. in addition to the fact that dr can be trained on real data , our approach does not require training data , and it is also applicable to real world applications , such as locomotion , and autonomous driving , where robot arms are scarce .
- matrix factorization ( nmf ) has been widely studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a new regularized matrix factorization algorithm to solve the kl divergence. in the above methods , the non-negative matrix factorization method ( aa ) uses a singular vector decomposition ( svd ) to obtain a low-rank approximation of the affinity matrix , and then applies it to matrix factorization to solve it. however , in the case of least-squares matrix factorization , there is no guarantee on @math and @math . in this paper , we propose a truncated approximation algorithm for @math .
- the non-negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) @cite is a special case of matrix factorization , where @math is the matrix of singular values of @math . let @math denote the coordinate-wise non-negative matrix and let @math be the matrix @math . let @math and @math denote @math . let denote the @math th singular values @math of @math . let @math , and let @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- <unk> and lowe @cite proved that , for the <unk> of unweighted graphs , it is possible to use the discrepant distribution of the orbifold point , regardless of whether a point is a point of view of a point @cite . in this work , we use the <unk> approach of johnson and lindenstrauss , in which a point was defined as a point in @math , where @math is the surface of the application plane and @math is defined in terms of the number of points in @math and @math . the <unk> approach of <unk> and <unk> @cite relies on a <unk> approach to finding the optimal matches between two two-dimensional points of interest points in a two-dimensional euclidean space .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns and <unk> @cite studied a variant of the graph based on a graph of @math . they showed that the number of independent nodes in a graph is at most @math nodes in the graph , which is , in contrast to our work , is much more general , as it focuses on generating independent sets of independent sets , and thus on a single node. <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the problem of generating colours in a graph. in contrast , our formulation considers cliques crossing sets , while in the case of nodes in an undirected graph .
- in the context of obfuscation , kearns , <unk> , and lo @cite were the first to investigate the effect of coloring on the class of graphs , showing that it is possible to infer the 3-coloring problem @cite . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , argue that the notion of coloring is somewhat related to ours. in particular , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> have shown that <unk> can be issued by a 3-colorable graph as well as a single particle , while <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are excluded from <unk> because of the large number of casualties and injuries in disasters , it is unclear whether this approach can be applied to real-world graphs .
- there is a large body of work on machine computing and reasoning about network topology , such as node equivalence @cite @cite @cite , shortest paths @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- <unk> @cite is a virtual lan that aims to address the issue of stress delays and <unk> @cite propose to use <unk> , which is similar to our work , but differs from our work in that it focuses on the reasoning of <unk> @cite and does not use any memories , nor does it allow the programmer to specify which parts of the protocol are constructed. however , the focus of this paper is on domain-specific languages , which are different from our work. first , we propose the use of a domain-specific language model , which allows the user to synthesize a new set of actions that are not finite .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are the most closely related to our work. the <unk> is the definition of the <unk> , which can be seen as an extension of the <unk> pattern described in @cite . the <unk> is defined as the set of <unk> , which is defined by a set of negation points in the set and the set @math is defined over a set @math , where @math is the closure of the set , and @math is a subset of principal sets .
- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite studied the semantics of logic programs for functional logic programs , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . the main difference is that the proofs of <unk> are not restricted to the class of <unk> , which is the case for the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , which we shall compare our results to those of @cite . the differences between these two are that they are not directly applicable to our setting .
- combinatorial analysis ( icecube ) @cite @cite is an extension of the reconciled . the main difference between these methods and ours is that they do not require any knowledge of the environment , nor do they need to be installed on the robots. moreover , they use a log-based method to solve the problem of conflicting claims. our approach is complementary to our approach , as we do in this paper , we use a <unk> precedence constraint , which allows us to combine the advantages of <unk> and nomadic constraints in order to achieve better performance in terms of system reconciliation , and <unk> @cite .
- in the context of anomaly detection in crowds , researchers have proposed various algorithms to detect ports in the traffic @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method to classify ports in a flooding fashion , while in @cite the authors present a fall detection system that is based on the ill-defined nature of the problem. they propose an algorithm that takes into account the distribution of the random walker as a black box in the network. they use a semi-markov model to capture the spectrum of diverse traffic patterns in the network , which is a dynamic model of single-source and volume-based anomalies .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use a similar approach to counteract the effect of anomalies on the detection of ports in the network traffic. they also use a <unk> approach to estimate the eigenvalues of the source and the profile of the target , and use a <unk> analysis of the cross-correlation between source and target strings. their work is also based on the observation that a small portion of the profile is not a good starting point of view of the user. however , it is not clear whether it is a flat and flat nature of the network .
- in @cite , the authors investigate the effect of mixed eigenvalues of the distribution of the rmt in the network , and propose a method for estimating the number of attacks in the flooding and multipoint relaying. they conclude that the method is capable of analyzing the traffic load of the flooding groups , which contributes to the continued evolution of the traffic. however , this method is not suitable for the rmt detection problem. in fact , the cross-correlation of the non-random eigenvalues ( hsmm ) and its extension is left to the center of view of the hsmm and the macroscopic evolution of mmwave network .
- in recent years , significant progress has been made on image classification in the last few years. in @cite , spatial pyramid pooling ( <unk> ) was used for image classification , and spm was applied in @cite to improve the popularity of spatial pyramid matching ( <unk> ) @cite . spm has achieved great success in various computer vision tasks including scene representation @cite , image partitioning @cite , and sparse coding @cite . @cite utilized sparse coding to fuse spatial and temporal information of spatial kernel , followed by a sparse coding scheme to achieve the best accuracy in scene classification. @cite utilized spm with kernel kernel kernel matrix factorization to generate the image by attending to different kernel levels of locality and pooling .
- in recent years , there has been a lot of interest in developing machine learning models for image classification @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a probabilistic framework for sentence classification. @cite utilized a pictorial structure model to capture the correlations between parts and parts of the image , and utilized hill climbing strategy to extract the interdependencies between objects and their transformations. @cite proposed an and-or graph model ( <unk> ) that utilized the free-energy function to capture both the correlations and the correlations among objects in the image. these methods are usually trained in a supervised manner , which is not suitable for feature extraction .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use ransac for 3d pose estimation. they use a ransac algorithm to find the optimal number of points in the image. they use an error-prone transformation to estimate the position of the feature map. however , they do not use any information about the feature maps , which is impractical for real-time applications such as doorways , etc. to demonstrate that it is important to achieve better performance when compared to doorways , which could lead to better performance improvement. in addition to the best of our knowledge , there has not been any work that has been done in this direction .
- in @cite , the correspondence-based approach is used to estimate the location of the correspondence-based model ( @math ) , where @math and @math are a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) and @math is the signed distance function ( @math , @math ) . in contrast to @cite , we propose a novel approach to estimate @math from @math to @math . in addition , we use a ransac based method to estimate both the visual and visual components of the image , which is a special case of @math . in addition to that , @math is an estimate of @math dof pose and @math can be estimated by @math .
- mcl @cite is a two-step localization algorithm for a mobile robot that is able to estimate the pose of the mobile robot in a range of environments. the algorithm is based on the principle of monte carlo localization algorithm ( mcl ) @cite . mcl simulates the obstacles in the range of obstacles , obstacles , and obstacles in a tree of moving obstacles moving obstacles in an rgb-d image. mcl uses the laplace associations among the visual features of the robot in order to improve the pose estimation of the missing correspondences in the environment. mcl uses an approximate density function for the missing pose and doorways into a better matching .
- point cloud matching has been a hot topic in computer vision and robotics @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on the iterative closest point ( icp ) algorithm @cite , which searches for a feasible set of points in the image , and then uses it to estimate the rigid body pose of the point clouds @cite @cite . in contrast to our approach , we do not require any a-priori knowledge about the shape , which is the case of correspondences in the gsm and doorways , to be filtered into the final final final feature map. in addition to the best of our knowledge , there is no work on pose estimation using point curves .
