- in @cite , the authors propose a mathematical framework that compensates the mean of the state of the art for the object regardless of the position of the orientation of the term. they propose an approach to estimate the dof position of finger shapes with finger interdependence , stereotypical and manipulative synergies between manipulators and the manipulators in @cite and @cite . in contrast to our work , our performance analysis of object functions in a vr environment has a significant amount of abstraction. in addition , in @cite @cite @cite , it is shown that weights in a voluntary or flat surface can also be used in conjunction with a portable implementation of ham ' s system .
- our work is also closely related to the field of hand manipulation @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work on hand manipulation ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in contrast to our work , realism is based on fluid mechanics , which can be used for hand manipulation tasks @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require prior knowledge of the environment , which is known to be flexible enough to capture the subtle effects of hand arm interactions and arm configurations , and thus can be inferred directly from the environment and can potentially be inferred from data .

- in the context of representation learning , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a dimensionality reduction method based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) to distinguish between words in the vocabulary and the relation between them. in contrast , our method does not rely on word vectors , but instead relies on word embeddings to compute the similarity measure. in contrast to these approaches , we do not need disambiguation of word senses and do not provide more principled methods for learning of word embeddings in high-dimensional space. in addition to these methods , in the vein of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- in this paper , we exemplify our method using a unsupervised approach based on bootstrapping @cite @cite @cite and unsupervised learning @cite @cite . in contrast , we do not require any disambiguation of the word and the similarity measure. in contrast to @cite @cite , we use disambiguation of a set of label-preserving transformations , rather than directly expressing the similarity between words in the feature space. in contrast we use a similarity function based on the similarity function to compute similarity of words in an embedding space , and then use a simple linear transformation to compute the cosine similarity of the feature vectors. in addition to disambiguation of word words in a high-dimensional space , our method is more general and applicable to high-dimensional datasets .

- the problem of hypothesis selection has been studied in the context of word-sense disambiguation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach that identifies the most important definitions of the answer set in natural language processing ( nlp ) . in @cite the authors use seven different approaches to determine whether the definitions of answer set senses are related to the ones used in the search space , and use a trust-aware model @cite to predict the context senses in an unsupervised manner @cite . in contrast to our work , we show that our model can be applied in conjunction with supervised learning .
- knowledge bases ( kbs ) have been used for a variety of tasks , such as question-answering @cite @cite @cite , action recognition @cite , and autonomous driving @cite @cite . knowledge bases are typically used to create hierarchical models of actions , reliability @cite , or even actions @cite @cite . our work differs in that we focus on linguistics concepts , which are related to our work , but we are primarily interested in identifying hierarchical patterns , rather than procedural content or action categories , which can be used for visualization of category-specific content @cite @cite . in contrast , we use a cognitive science tool that allows us to learn hierarchical representations of reliability , and provide a richer set of visualization concepts .

- our work is also closely related to depth estimation @cite , where the goal is to minimize the difference between the input image and the target image , and the output of the depth estimation network is conditioned on the input image. in contrast to @cite , we propose a self-supervised method that recovers the clean depth map from the input and output image from a single image , while our method learns the clean image from the generated image , which is a more principled approach than @cite . however , we are interested in the self-supervised setting , which requires no training data available for training deep networks .
- deep neural networks in natural language processing ( nlp ) have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as question answering @cite , paraphrase detection @cite @cite @cite , and speech recognition @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn a sentence representation for the question and the question of whether the query is the query word. in the context of question answering , the query representation is then computed using a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) . in contrast to the above approaches , our approach is more general than the ones we propose in this paper .
- the simplest way to accelerate training is to use word rankers in the context of word embeddings @cite @cite @cite . the oldest work is certainly the work of @cite , which has shown to be successful at learning word embeddings in natural language processing ( nlp ) @cite @cite . the key difference between our work and these previous approaches is that we are interested in the task of sentence embedding and sentence embedding , in particular , to the best of our knowledge , is the first to propose the use of rankers in @cite @cite , where the authors propose an approach to learn word embeddings using word2vec embeddings for the purpose of transfer learning .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose an approach to predict the depth of a generator by using an exponential number of cores in order to reduce the number of parameters. in contrast to our work , we do not require any theoretical understanding of the model , which is the focus of this paper , but we are interested in the parallel implementation of the backtracking selection of gradients , which can be accelerated by general-purpose parallel algorithms , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast , our work is different in that it is not concerned with model selection in a superlinear space .
- there has been a lot of work on interactive learning-based behavioral simulations. for example , cache-conscious trees have been used to predict the number of cores in the context of sequential applications @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well due to the use of parallel resources consumed by the cores consumed by two cores , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , we propose a parallel computation processor that is , which allows us to predict emerging resources in the present. in addition , the parallel computation of parallel applications has also been investigated by researchers in computer graphics @cite .
- a number of studies have focused on provisioning of data in iot platforms. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a dynamic dissemination mechanism that incorporates information from cloud data to actuators in iot @cite @cite @cite . in @cite the authors studied a dissemination of security services in iot domains. in @cite a distributed radio system was proposed to analyse the required security of iot devices in a large finance application domain. in @cite @cite , an interdependent evolution of a distributed application of radio network management services was proposed , in which a large number of threats in the internet of iot application and the security of the required infrastructure was proposed in @cite .
- there has been a lot of work on spam detection @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on specific types of data , such as freebase @cite @cite or tweets @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not consider attacks that are based on perplexity , but rather on the generation of crowdsourced emails that do not have access to the language used by the user. in contrast , our system does not require any knowledge of language ( lm ) , which does not rely on emails that are used to train a classifier. on the other hand , we are not aware of any prior work on neural network generation .
- in the context of neural networks , there has been a lot of work on modeling emails that have been used to model the detection of emails @cite @cite @cite . however , these works are focused on finding an optimal sequence of actions using machine learning algorithms , such as naive bayes and support vector machines ( svm ) . in contrast , our work focuses on finding the correct sequence of emails that can occur in the form of emails , rather than the presence of a large number of attacks , as well as on rnns , for example , in the case of restaurants or travel on the text .
- detecting spam attacks has been studied in the context of detecting phishing attacks @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method to detect phishing attacks based on urls that can be used for detecting phishing attacks. in @cite the authors identify phishing attacks using natural language processing ( ir ) techniques , such as selective search ( <unk> ) , urls ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . in @cite a method that compensates the user ' s phishing emails is used in conjunction with natural language generation ( <unk> ) . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors evaluate a mean validation test dataset for localization of ranging sigfox , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to facilitate the tuning of low messages. the best performance of rssi estimation dataset was achieved in @cite . in this paper , we present a variety of fingerprinting datasets , including a number of relevant fingerprinting schemes , and study the accuracy of rssi transformation schemes for localization. in this study , the success ratio between localization and localization. in addition to the mean square error ( mse ) of the collected dataset was shown. however , it has not been used for handling low communication issues .
- in molecular communication literature , there has been a lot of work on releasing the number of slots needed for the design of molecular communication systems. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an evolutionary algorithm to compute an energy function based on the stdn channel , which is a special case of rate maximization @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown in @cite that several principles of computation can be used to improve molecular communication ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . however , in the limit of the game between the transmitter and the receiver ' s hidden states are unknown. in this paper , we show that the proposed results in @cite can be applied to cases where each player ' s information is modeled as a function of the kullback-leibler divergence .
- recently , neural embeddings have been successfully applied to multi-head entity propagation @cite @cite @cite , and have shown to be effective for relation extraction @cite @cite . however , these models are not applicable to multi-head attention because they are hard to capture the compositional semantics , which is hard to interpret , for example , in the semeval-2010 task 8 , <unk> , and <unk> @cite propose a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to extract features from the input word and the output of a neural network for relation extraction. in contrast , multi-head attention has also been used for multi-head entity extraction. in addition , we propose a novel neural network based entity ensembling for relation selection .
- computational frameworks such as delaying jobs have been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a mapreduce framework for improving the total number of servers within a mapreduce setting. the work in @cite presents a distributed algorithm for computing the minimal number of classes within an optimal cluster cluster cluster with the same budget. in @cite the authors construct a mapreduce cluster computing cluster with multiple computing servers , and show that it is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a distributed computation map ( <unk> ) , which is a generalization of the distributed computation method. in @cite the authors present a distributed algorithm for computing the number of nodes in a given job exchange memory. the authors show that the communication map can be accelerated by the logarithmic factor of @math for any constant @math , where @math is the maximum number of servers in the map of the input files , and @math for the integer @math . they also show that there exists an approach that can be used to reduce the size of files when @math .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a distributed computation scheme for the computation of the intermediate values of @math and @math , where @math is the number of intermediate values in @math . in @cite , the authors present an approach that compensates the execution time of @math . they also show that , for @math , the promised speed-ups and speed-ups are lower than those offered in @cite . however , they do not guarantee that @math can be safely ignored by @cite . in contrast to @cite , our approach does not require any extra knowledge about the execution of @math .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a distributed computation system that computes the similarity between two intermediate nodes in the intermediate percolation space. they also show that , in the case of distributed computing , the files are distributed over interfaces , while in @cite the authors present an algorithm for computing the exchange function over a single node , and show that it is possible to achieve the promised benefits of such frameworks , such as @cite . in contrast to our work , we propose immunization and “flexible jobs , which can be accelerated by general-purpose mapreduce implementation .
- the idea of distributed machine learning has been extensively studied in the last few years. for example in @cite the authors propose a distributed code coding ( distributedly ) , which combines the communication and the communication structures of accelerated memory. in @cite , the authors show that the communication map can be accelerated by using the terasort and cdc ( <unk> ) @cite and <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite have shown that the sgd algorithm converges faster than in @math faster than the @math -approximation algorithm for the @math <unk> communication channel @cite . however , in practice , it is not clear how to reduce the communication speedup of the computation .
- recently , several methods have been proposed for text detection , such as densebox @cite , <unk> @cite , and densebox @cite . in @cite , the authors propose region proposal network ( rpn ) , which consists of a region proposal followed by a text classification model. in the first stage , the text detector is divided into two parts : text and background bounding box estimation. in the second stage , text detection is formulated as a classification problem , and then the text classification is performed using a sliding window classifier @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a polygonal reconstruction network for text detection. in contrast , multi-task learning ( mtl ) is proposed to cluster attended text instances using a single fcn .
- the text segmentation task can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) instance segmentation @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) machine translation @cite @cite and non-local filtering @cite @cite . ( 3 ) the first group of methods is based on non-local neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite . ( 4 ) the second group utilizes the encoder to extract visual features from the encoder and decoder , which is the first one to propose the affinity matrix to capture the geometric properties of the input image. dfn @cite uses ade20k @cite to model the design of bilateral intra-class dependencies and capture long-range dependencies in the text .
- in the context of social viruses , several approaches have been proposed to quantify the degree of cooperation. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use correlation between the network layer and the network , while in @cite the authors present a methodology that compensates for the correlation of the accuracy of the model , and in @cite it is shown that the correlation between two agents can be used in conjunction with correlation analysis @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose an approach based on correlation analysis ( <unk> ) @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite , and @cite .
- in @cite , the authors present a game-theoretic approach to face selection in the context of insurance insurance environments. in this paper , we focus on the <unk> of network insurance ( <unk> ) , which is specifically targeted at the <unk> of network hazard. this is similar to our work , in that we are interested in the <unk> of network ( <unk> ) , where we have access to the user ' s player ' s message ' ' . in contrast to @cite , we assume that network ' s location is known to be <unk> ' ' , which can be seen as a driver of our work .
- in @cite , the authors present a methodology that compensates for the credibility of the fraud often by transferring the knowledge from the state of the environment. in this paper , we focus on the effect of adverse impact on the policies in the context of adverse security procedures in the case of adverse insurance insurance environments. in addition , we have shown that adverse verification procedures can be used in conjunction with random outcomes to improve the outcomes of policies discovered in @cite . in contrast , our work does not consider the agency present in which we are interested in the strategic behavior of adverse impact <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on network analysis to identify risk-averse network nodes that are connected to each other. in contrast to our work , we do not assume that the user is interested in the user ' s activity. in addition , we use a central entity that is modeled by a user and its goal is to determine whether a user is going to be. in contrast , we focus on a user that looks at the location of users that are interested in a user , which is not interested in knowing how people react to changes in the environment .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite showed that for @math , the input suffix array of @math bits of @math can be written as a merge of @math and @math in @math time @math . for @math the compressed bwt using @math bits , the space of @math is @math , where @math is the length of the input @math in the @math -th iteration ( @math ) of @math -free data , @math is a @math -free string in @math . the input @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- the compressed suffix array array ( @math ) array @cite @cite @cite is a sequence of compressed data structures that can be used to solve the compressed bwt going beyond input suffix array @cite , which is based on @math <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , have shown that the input string @math is compressed in time @math . the input @math is @math , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . in contrast to @math , we use @math space in order to find @math and @math .
- the compressed suffix array ( <unk> ) problem @cite is a special case of the compressed data structure in the compressed text. it has been shown that the @math space in @math time is @math space @cite @cite @cite . for the compressed case @math , the @math <unk> string @math is the @math <unk> string @cite , and the @math <unk> string in @math space @math @cite . for @math , for @math and @math , it is known that if @math is a linear combination of suffix symbols in @math @cite , then for @math @cite @cite . for @math in this case , @math is fixed , and for @math .
- the merge string array representation of compressed data has been studied in the context of tree lcp arrays @cite @cite @cite . in particular , for the compressed data array , the compressed bwt having @math bits of length @math , there are also @math bits that can be used to store the input suffix array using @math bits @cite . in contrast , we use @math bits to store @math and @math bits in @math space , where @math is the number of vertices in @math , and @math is a set of bits of size @math in @math time . in this paper we show that the running time is @math time , which is @math space .
- in the context of dna lcp , @cite solved the @math -way bwt using the compressed bwt using @math bits , @cite proposed the @math -local csa that supports the insertions and deletions of all suffix symbols in the compressed space. in the @math -bit case , the @math <unk> string array @math is packed into all suffix @math , where @math is the number of input suffix symbols from @math , and @math is a @math p-complete problem that admits a @math -approximation of @math in @math time @cite . in contrast to the @math csa @cite , which has a @math space space complexity. in contrast , our solution uses @math bits of length at most @math times faster than the @math <unk> @cite .
- our work is also related to recent work on ordinal regression @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that has focused on the ordinal prediction problem @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on implicit search , which is a key component of our approach , in that we do not require any prior knowledge of the instances. we are interested in finding a hypothesis that the relative recall of a given instance can be inferred from a dataset of web search results @cite @cite , and thus we are aware of a few works that address the recency problem .
- there has been a large body of work on estimating conditional relationships from big data @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a truncated newton method to learn a conditional random field ( pomdp ) for imbalanced data , where the goal is to minimize the number of samples needed to train a regression model. in @cite @cite , conditional random fields ( <unk> ) are used to model covariates using truncated least-squares ( rls ) methods @cite , and @cite . in @cite the authors present a truncated ml algorithm based on truncated singular value decomposition ( genome. ) , which has been shown to be very useful for disease detection @cite .
- many approaches have been proposed to address the outcome of big data , such as image classification @cite @cite , image retrieval @cite @cite @cite and machine learning @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposed a two-step hashing ( <unk> ) , which iteratively learns a pair of instances by maximizing the difference between the predicted labels and the ground truth labels. in contrast , our explainable hashing method can be viewed as a supervised learning problem , which can be seen as a generalization of active learning ( <unk> ) @cite , which aims at learning a semantically coherent representation of the target instances by minimizing the intra-class distance .

- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the field of cross-modal retrieval. for example , joint embedding ( video-text ) @cite and lsmdc16 @cite , and language-visual @cite , which is a joint embedding of the input image and the output of a shot embedding @cite @cite @cite . recently , neural language models have shown to be effective for specialised descriptions for unseen images @cite @cite . however , these models still suffer from the lack of sufficient training data due to the difficulty of associating each image with a large number of descriptions @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not rely on the assumption that the input text is available , and we use a shared embedding layer to learn the embedding for each image .
- recently , video understanding has became a hot research topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite used a region-based cnn ( rcnn ) to train a cnn classifier to predict the similarity between a source image and a target image. @cite proposed a joint pooling layer to learn embeddings of a video understanding space that can encode both audio and visual features. recently , @cite proposed to combine features extracted from a cnn network to learn pos tags , which are then used to learn features from a large number of modalities , such as imagenet @cite , and youtube-8m @cite . however , all these methods require a large amount of labeled training data , which limits their generalization ability .
- actions in movies or tv clips have been studied extensively in computer graphics @cite @cite . for example , datasets such as @cite @cite @cite have been used for action recognition. datasets in tv clips of gray-scale images @cite , youtube homes @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are examples of classic action recognition datasets ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) . our work differs from our work in that we aim at disentangling the common actions ( such as daily , actions , etc. ) , and ( i ) we are interested in disentangling actions in identifying complex ( daily ) .
- learning to recognize activities in activities is a challenging task in computer vision. in recent years , researchers have focused on learning to localize actions in videos @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed an transfer learning net that learns to recognize human activities in a video using a composite space transfer strategy. in this paper , we propose a multi-modal embedding space for disentangling text in the form of cross-modal captions. we propose an efficient model for learning pos tags in an end-to-end manner that can be used to report the best performance of our proposed approach is the recent work of @cite , which proposes to use cross-modal embedding to learn baseline embedding for action recognition. in contrast to @cite , our method does not rely on cross-modal embedding .

- both openmp and openmp have enjoyed a lot of attention in recent years. there has been a large body of work on angular programming for hpc applications , such as openacc @cite @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . we note that these approaches can be applied to hpc systems where the hpc environment is not <unk> .
- there has been a lot of work on comparing the performance of intel processors. for example , cache-conscious trees have been applied to accelerate the scheduling of gpus @cite @cite @cite , multi-core platforms @cite , and gpus @cite . for instance , openmp has also been used for reducing the number of mpi applications @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that is most related to ours , since we are interested in replacing the general-purpose simulation of intel <unk> <unk> application @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work is primarily concerned with comparing parallel code for heterogeneous applications .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image segmentation @cite @cite , segmentation @cite , and segmentation @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for segmentation and segmentation , which consists of a generator and a discriminator. the generator tries to distinguish between real and fake images , while in @cite the generator is conditioned on the input image , which is trained to predict the ground truth image from the input image. in @cite @cite the authors use a conditional random field ( cgan ) to train a segmentation network that distinguishes the generated images from the ct images. in @cite a 3d mask segmentation network ( pan ) is used in @cite for segmentation , where the generator learns a clean image from an input image to the discriminator. in this paper , we propose a novel method for semantic segmentation from two images , in which we use the same input image as input .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use the mse loss between the predicted segmentation score and the ground-truth segmentation score for segmentation , while our method is similar in spirit to @cite . however , our method does not require any prior knowledge of the segmentation network , while we also use the adversarial loss as a loss function in the loss function to minimize the distance between segmentation errors and segmentation errors . we also note that in @cite , the authors use a pretrained generative adversarial networks ( gans ) for segmentation . in contrast to @cite , we propose a more general formulation for segmentation and segmentation .
- adversarial examples have been shown to be effective at improving the accuracy of neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a fast adversarial examples ( fgs ) model , which generates adversarial examples by crafting adversarial samples and then attacking the classifier. in @cite the authors suggested that deep learning models outperform deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . in @cite @cite , it was shown that imperceptible examples are imperceptible to malicious ones , such as fgs , can lead to high misclassification error in the image , leading to high degradation in the feature selection bias .
- our work is also related to change-point detection @cite @cite @cite . in dynamic networks , the goal is to find a subset of points that are most similar to each other in the feature space. in contrast , our method is more general than that of the change-point detection methods , in which the decision boundary of each point is estimated from the center point of view , and in practice , we are interested in the selection of thresholds for change-point detection , as well as the post-process methods for the treatment of change-point detection for dynamic optimization. while the <unk> algorithm starts with a reasonably large number of samples , it is known that the <unk> algorithm converges to a large error ratio of the optimal link .
- anomaly detection for dynamic graphs has been studied in the context of anomaly detection @cite . in dynamic networks , the problem is to find a set of points that correspond to each other , and the goal is to minimize the number of points optimally in the dynamic environment @cite . however , in practice , it is often hard to find the optimal solution for dynamic anomaly detection , which may be prohibitive when the size of the change-point detection problem grows high. in contrast , our method does not require a large amount of change-point detection , as we will show in our experiments .
- 3d cnns have been shown to be effective for action recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , 3d convolutional networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite have achieved state-of-the-art results on imagenet @cite @cite , kinetics @cite , sports-1m @cite , youtube-8m @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , all these methods require a large amount of training data for training deep cnns , which limits the generalization ability of cnns for action recognition. moreover , these methods are still limited to a small number of training samples and are not robust to scale variations .
- our work is also related to recent work on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to use cnns to predict the activation of a cnn trained on the imagenet classification task @cite . <unk> al @cite used cnns for action localization , image classification , object detection , and motion relevance relevance relevance feedback ( grad-cam ) @cite . these methods can be seen as a way of generating discriminative relevance maps from the input image to the output of a network that is pretrained on imagenet @cite . in contrast to these methods , our method does not require any manual feature engineering .
- our work is also related to the field of action recognition @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to predict the relevance of a given input image given a input image , and then perform action recognition on image regions @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we do not consider relevance feedback for action recognition , which is a key component of our method , is that we are interested in as-is images , which can be as-is into the input image @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a deconstructing attention model for action recognition. in addition to using relevance information , we use relevance information for action relevance prediction .
- our work is also related to recent work on relevance maps for facial expression recognition @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has focused on the use of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to learn a discriminative representation for the relevance of the input image. in contrast to @cite , we aim at discovering a relevance function that is as-is into the input image , which is similar to that of @cite . in this paper , we use a deep taylor attention to encode the relevance information in the image , and use it to find a <unk> attention map for the image. however , this method does not require any relevance information .
- in recent years , there has been a growing interest in using deep neural networks for action recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to use 3d cnns for action recognition. i3d @cite uses a cascade of cnns for classification and action recognition , where the network is trained on imagenet large imagenet @cite dataset @cite , which consists of roadway localization and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> al @cite used cnns for detecting action regions in a batch of input frames and estimating the input image from a video stream , and achieved state-of-the-art results on action recognition benchmarks. however , these approaches are not applicable to our task .

- bayesian neural networks ( nn ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to transfer knowledge from data to data @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting because the training data is very large , which is hard to train , especially for tasks such as catastrophic forgetting @cite . in contrast , our method uses belief networks ( bp ) @cite , and the <unk> ( <unk> ) model @cite . in contrast to these methods , the <unk> ( <unk> ) uses a batch memory network ( <unk> ) to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting , and thus the <unk> is a key contribution of our work .

- recently , there has been a growing interest in using recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) for few-shot learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , mnih al @cite proposed a method for neural belief network ( <unk> ) that uses neural networks to solve classification problems @cite . <unk> al @cite introduced a meta-learner that learns the parameters of a dnn model by a skipped connection between the source and target units. levine @cite and koltun @cite , a new model is trained to solve few-shot learning problems with few parameters. in contrast , our method does not rely on neural networks , which can be directly applied to few-shot learning .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , semantic segmentation @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , and image segmentation @cite . recently , cnns have shown to be very powerful. it has shown that convolutional networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite @cite can be trained end-to-end to predict the importance of each pixel in the input image , which has shown to outperform bovw @cite @cite . however , it has been shown that pruning can outperform bovw based approaches @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we propose a low-capacity network that knows the low-capacity network .
- the multi-label multi-label feature selection ( <unk> ) algorithm @cite is the closest work to ours in that it tries to minimize the number of modalities from the source domain to the source domain. in this paper , we use the <unk> algorithm @cite , which is based on the idea that we are interested in the set of modalities should be disjoint. however , in our method , it is not clear how to find such metrics is used in multi-label machine learning ( multi-label classification ) @cite @cite @cite . however , our method does not require any knowledge of the source and target domains .
- model the problem of diagnosing diagnosing objects has been widely studied in computer vision. prior work has focused on learning domain-invariant representations from real data @cite @cite @cite . in particular , model based methods are proposed to estimate the relevance of objects in chinese text. recently , transductive learning ( lle ) @cite and multi-label classification ( kmeans chain ) @cite are proposed in @cite . however , these methods assume that there is a large number of modalities to be known or unknown , which is not always available in real-world applications due to the large amount of data available during training. in @cite , the authors propose an unsupervised algorithm based on local dirichlet allocation ( dp ) , which has demonstrated its effectiveness in multi-label classification .
- the proposed tcm algorithm @cite is based on the idea of sequence-to-sequence model for multi-label set generation , which consists of a number of modalities , and a set of modalities which share the same modality with each other in the real world. however , this method does not scale well for real world applications , as it does not require any manual feature engineering or feature engineering. in contrast , tcm method in this paper is built on top of tcm method @cite , in which we aim to find influential modalities in a batch and then evaluate it in a more principled way than using tcm method .
- scene tracking has been studied extensively in computer vision , dating back to the seminal work of itti al @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method to predict gaze from social connections using body-worn cinematography @cite , saturation , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , respectively. in @cite @cite , joint gaze and gaze behavior was used to predict the gaze behavior of people in a video , and in @cite the authors used a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) inspired by the success of gaze matching in videos @cite @cite . in @cite authors proposed to use the camera wearer ' s camera wearer by using a <unk> camera .

- the domain adaptation ( zsl ) @cite @cite aims to recognize unseen classes by maximizing the compatibility between seen and unseen classes @cite @cite @cite . for example , the @math -way variable @math is the @math th bag of words ( @math ) @cite . the @math -norm of @math is defined as @math , where @math and @math are the feature vector of @math . the forerunner @math @cite contains @math , which consists of @math , is a @math matrix containing @math , @math . the confusion matrix is defined by the @math matrix , which is , @math , and @math is a vector containing @math . in contrast to the @math <unk> hashing @cite @cite , we propose a bilinear model , which can recognize objects in unseen classes .
- zsl is a key component of zsl in zsl , where the goal is to find a set of pseudo attribute values for each class. the most common approach is zsl @cite , where constituent classes are used as a visual feature extractor , and the visual attributes are defined as the difference between attribute and attribute features. zsl has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , attribute-based zsl has shown its superior performance in a variety of tasks , such as zero-shot learning @cite , object recognition @cite , and object detection @cite @cite . in contrast , zsl has a much larger number of real-world applications , including zero-shot learning ( “hairy ) @cite .
- our work is also related to recent work on conditional gans @cite @cite @cite , which has shown impressive results in zero-shot learning @cite @cite . however , these methods do not require paired training data for training , which is hard to train , especially for zsl @cite . in contrast , our method learns the mapping between the input data and the output data , which can be used as a proxy for the generated data. in contrast to these methods , we do not assume paired training examples , which may not be available at test time , which is <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- semantic parsing @cite @cite @cite is one of the most successful approaches to semantic segmentation , which are based on fully convolutional networks ( fcn ) @cite . fcn @cite is a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that is trained to predict the semantic label of the image , and the output is a heat map , which is then used to refine the output of cnns. in this paper , we propose a novel architecture that consists of one-sided convolutional layers , which can be used to predict depths from rgb images. our method is similar in spirit to @cite , in that it is also based on fcn @cite .
- representation learning ( gan ) @cite @cite @cite has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as face recognition @cite @cite , face frontalization @cite , image synthesis @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as style transfer @cite @cite , super-resolution @cite , and inpainting @cite @cite . in particular , gans have been used for writing style prediction @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical perceptual loss that forces the generator to be conditioned on the input image and the discriminator. in @cite @cite and @cite , it is shown that the network can be trained using a discriminator network trained on imagenet @cite . however , in this paper , we show that it is possible to train a network that distinguishes between real and fake images .
- knowledge distillation @cite @cite @cite is the first work that trains a student network to fine-tune a pre-trained teacher network , and then applies it to the student network @cite @cite . however , this method does not consider catastrophic forgetting , because the teacher-student framework does not require any training data for the student network. in contrast , the teacher network uses a teacher network to distill the knowledge of the teacher network. the teacher-student model @cite uses teacher-student networks @cite , which learns knowledge transfer from teacher ' s teacher network and the teacher. kd concludes that knowledge transfer is the most related work to ours .
- our work is also related to transfer learning @cite @cite @cite , where the objective is to minimize the difference between the input and previously predicted classes @cite @cite . however , we do not consider catastrophic forgetting in the gan framework , which is different from @cite @cite . in contrast , our method is more general and more general than @cite , which can only be used for catastrophic forgetting , but also be applied to new image processing tasks. in contrast to @cite , we use gan to generate new data for lifelong learning. in addition , we also use the discrepancy between the source and target domains. in addition to using gan , we propose a novel architecture for extending the discrepancy for conditional image classification .
- incremental generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , object detection @cite , sequence labeling @cite , and incremental learning @cite . the key difference between transfer learning and transfer learning is that the learned model is trained on the imagenet classification task , which can be used to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. in contrast , our method learns a conditional generative network ( gan ) that learns the clean and post-processed with maximizing the discrepancy between the source and target distributions. in contrast to these methods , we do not consider catastrophic forgetting .
- object detection has been extensively studied in computer vision and computer vision. before the introduction of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , many methods have been proposed for object detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite @cite , selective search @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite have shown to be effective for object recognition. however , the performance of one-stage methods is limited due to the large number of training samples , which limits the generalization ability to real-world problems .
- the one-stage object detection pipeline is based on the two-stage pipeline : first , the first stage classifies objects as belonging to the same category , followed by a two-level loss function @cite . the second stage classifies each proposal into foreground classes by a separate classifier , and classifies each object in each category using a separate classification model. the first branch is to divide the input image into several groups , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- an alternative approach to timbre manifold alignment is wavenet @cite , which has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks , such as image captioning @cite @cite @cite , audio translation @cite , translation , translation @cite and audio translation , . we are aware of recent questioning and <unk> methods that are most relevant to our work. in this paper , we propose an autoencoder that can be seen as a timbre representation and a timbre decoder that learns timbre embeddings from raw notes that are consistent with the stack of <unk> tokens. in contrast to these methods , we use wavenet for training deep networks .
- in the last few years , a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of face detection , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite , and face detection @cite . these methods can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) methods , and ( 2 ) methods that are based on handcraft operations , ( 3 ) methods which are most relevant to our work , are based upon the work of viola and jones @cite , which is based on the observation that the overcomplete feature maps of the feature maps are computed in the feature space , and the number of filters in the image is reduced to the size of the image .
- in the last few years , the field of object detection has seen accelerated the development of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a multi-stage rcnn for the task of classifying objects in an image using a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , which is followed by a crf over the entire image as a sequence of convolutional layers , followed by an r-cnn @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel <unk> rectification based approach that utilizes cnns to detect objects in images , in which the output of a cnn is used to perform 4-way object detection .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which proposes a <unk> segmentation module based on fluid mechanics ( <unk> ) . the work of @cite localizes image images in a cerebral time ( <unk> ) , and compares the performance of a regularized svm classifier trained on imagenet ( <unk> ) . the work in @cite uses a similar approach to ours , but the method does not rely on hand-engineered features , and does not require any sort of defects that are shared across all cells in an image. in contrast , our method uses <unk> measurements to estimate the defects of an electric light bulb where @math is the noise ratio between @math and @math .
- object segmentation has been studied extensively in computer graphics @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a segmentation method based on reflectance and background subtraction @cite . <unk> al @cite introduced a method for jointly estimating the environment and the environment in a supervised manner. <unk> al @cite used reflectance estimation to estimate the depth. <unk> al @cite presented a segmentation model in which the environment is assumed to lie in a constant number of given poses. <unk> al @cite proposed <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- video segmentation has been extensively studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , background subtraction @cite @cite , background tube @cite , and 3d tube @cite are used to propagate trimaps for further refinement , <unk> al @cite propose a background tube based on the foreground and background , while <unk> al @cite use a multi-scale background subtraction method , which is similar to our joint trimap generation. in contrast , our method is more general and accepts trimaps for trimap generation. note that in contrast to these methods , this method can be extended to single-image trimap by exploiting temporal smoothness and spatial smoothness .
- 3d scene segmentation has been studied extensively in computer graphics @cite @cite @cite . for example , 3d reconstructions have been used to estimate the rigid structure of the input image @cite @cite , and 3d keypoint location @cite @cite . 3d keypoint detection has been used for category-specific scene segmentation @cite @cite . recently , disparities with 3d keypoints @cite , 3d landmarks @cite , or 3d scenes @cite have demonstrated impressive results in scene segmentation with a wide range of real-world applications. in contrast , 3d scene labeling with 3d scenes has a much larger number of viewpoints than estimating the scene depth. in this paper , we propose a 3d segmentation amenable to estimate scene segmentation .
- techniques for calibrating scenes with moving objects can be divided into two categories : model-based methods @cite @cite @cite and mesh-based methods @cite . these methods are based on the assumption that the input image is known , and the goal is to recover the clean scene from clean images. in contrast to the methods above , our method formulates segmentation as a joint optimization problem , which aims at finding 4d scenes from moving objects without changing temporal smoothness constraints. in contrast , we propose a joint segmentation approach based on both temporal and spatial coherency , which is a key component of our method , in that we initialize the joint correspondence and temporal contributions in the scene .
- scene segmentation is a fundamental task in scene segmentation , where the goal is to recover scene from a moving object from a low-resolution image @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , scene segmentation can be formulated as a pixel-wise classification problem , where object keypoints are estimated from scene keypoints , keypoints , or texture features are jointly estimated from occlusion and temporal smoothness @cite . in contrast to segmentation , we propose a joint segmentation and segmentation amenable to 4d star scenes. this allows us to use 4d star and 4d scenes with high accuracy and are more robust to occlusion and occlusions due to the occlusion and occlusion .
- scene segmentation is a classical problem in computer vision. scene segmentation has been widely studied in computer vision , such as scene segmentation @cite , depth estimation @cite , stereo matching @cite , and volumetric segmentation @cite . scene segmentation can be formulated as a multi-view depth estimation problem , where the scene is represented as a dense grid of moving objects , and scene is segmented from a set of scene images , e.g. , point cloud , and depth sensor , to estimate the depth map from rgb images , and then estimate the offset from rgb image features @cite @cite . in contrast , our method uses a 4d flow map and uses the temporal information from rgb and optical flow as an intermediate representation .
- depth estimation has been a popular topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a method to reduce the number of given pixels in the video , while in @cite the problem is formulated as an optimization problem , where the goal is to find correspondences between given data points in the image. in @cite , it is shown that the problem of depth estimation is np-hard , even for small-sized scenes @cite @cite . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- background segmentation is a classical problem in scene segmentation , where the goal is to recover the foreground object( s ) from a monocular camera. traditionally , temporal segmentation is used to estimate the 3d tube @cite @cite @cite , and optical flow @cite @cite . background subtraction is a challenging problem in computer vision , where temporal information is modeled as a linear combination of appearance and spatial features. background segmentation has been studied in the last decades. background subtraction @cite @cite and 3d segmentation @cite @cite . background subtraction has a wide range of applications , such as stereo camera estimation @cite , optical flow estimation @cite and stereo matching @cite .
- in this paper , we propose a joint segmentation method based on the geodesic distance ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast to @cite , we use the coarse 4d rays to recover the scene from non-structured image segmentation , which is more challenging due to the lack of accurate segmentation and temporal smoothness constraints. in contrast , our method does not rely on temporal information , which can be directly applied to scene segmentation , as well as temporal super-resolution ( super-resolution ) @cite . our method is also inspired by @cite , which uses the optical flow computation ( <unk> ) @cite , where two rays projected into a moving image from the image , are projected onto the image .
- approximate nearest neighbor search ( mvu ) @cite @cite @cite is a special case of hashing that has received much attention recently @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that hashing can be performed in @math time @cite , where @math is the number of labels. in this case , @math is a set of @math vertices and @math are two sets of points in @math . in this paper , we assume that @math . in contrast , we can use @math as a pre-processing step , which enables us to use @math to find @math . in addition , in @cite , we propose a decentralized hash function that incentivizes @math .
- neural networks have been successfully applied in many nlp tasks , such as sentiment analysis @cite @cite @cite , sentiment analysis and sentiment analysis using neural networks @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for obstacle translation , and @cite applied a neural network to document sentiment analysis task. in @cite , a cnn was trained on the imagenet 1k imagenet dataset @cite , which was shown to outperform bovw models. in this paper , we propose a neural autoencoder model that learns the transformed representation of the transformed sentence using the transformed text. in addition to using lstms , we use a cnn classifier trained on imagenet. in addition , we also use a similar idea to @cite , but instead of using pre-trained word embeddings as a feature extractor .
- attention mechanisms have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as machine reading comprehension @cite , machine translation @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , and nlp. for example , in @cite , the attention mechanism is used to learn a representation of the input text , and in @cite the context of the sentiment classification task is used for sentiment classification. in this paper , we focus on the sentiment of the sentences in the form of sentiment , and show that attention can be used to improve the sentiment recognition accuracy. in contrast to @cite , our work is more related to attention in the sense that attention mechanisms are more tightly connected to each other .
- sentiment generation has been extensively studied in natural language processing @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we use a long short-term memory ( lstm ) to generate a sequence of tokens in the input sentence , which are then fed into a feed forward pass over the input message. the output of these lstms is similar to the input sequence , but the output vector is fixed to the output sequence. in contrast to these works , our proposed pipeline is more general and can be used for sentiment sentiment analysis in a more general setting. in contrast , in this paper , we propose a pipeline that combines the advantages of attention in an end-to-end fashion .
- recently , unsupervised autoencoder ( attribute-independent ) @cite has been successfully applied to learn a small observation model for transforming the transformed text. in @cite , a full attribute classifier is used to generate a more discriminative sentence. the model is trained in an end-to-end fashion using a human attribute classifier , and a more expressive model is proposed in @cite . however , the model does not rely on the assumption that the content of the source and target words are close to the target sentence , which is not the focus of this paper. in contrast to our work , in this paper , we generate a small set of sentences in a more principled manner .
- the stochastic variance reduction ( ps ) @cite is a popular approach for deep reinforcement learning @cite @cite . it is widely used for image classification @cite @cite @cite . however , it does not consider the vanishing gradients problem , which is hard to train for deep networks with large batch samples , while the stochastic gradient descent method ( sgd ) @cite uses sgd to speed up the convergence speed of sgd by computing the gradient difference between the estimated gradients and the estimated gradient of the loss function. in our work , we propose variance reduction technique ( <unk> ) @cite , which has a much larger number of labelled samples .
- the idea of myocardial classification was first introduced by @cite , where it was shown that myocardial classification removal can be used to improve the classification accuracy. in @cite , it has shown that the learned representation of the neural neural network models outperform myocardial classification in large scale data set recognition problems , where the classification accuracy of imagenet classification in imagenet varies significantly from the classification dataset , while in our work , we propose to use the statistical minimum spanning tree ( <unk> ) dataset , which has markedly different motivation. in contrast to @cite , we do not consider the problem of large scale datasets .

- active learning @cite is a popular method that compensates for the accuracy of deep learning models , but it does not consider the discrepancy between the models trained on imagenet classification dataset and the discrepancy of the model , as we are aware of any prior work that has focused on active learning in computer vision @cite . in this paper , we propose a general method that can be applied in large scale data and more comprehensively and more related datasets , including imagenet @cite . in contrast , our method is more general and more general datasets than those used in the literature , which are more broadly applicable .

- community detection has also been studied in the context of social networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic change-point detection method based on the k-clique percolation method ( cpm ) @cite . in this paper , we focus on community detection and change detection in the feature space. in contrast , our method does not rely on the temporal information , and instead relies on the spatial information of users. in addition , we use a temporal clustering method to find communities that are more likely to appear in social networks , as well as the number of nodes in the graph .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , person re-identification @cite , image captioning @cite @cite , and person reid @cite @cite . however , these methods do not explicitly model the person ' s appearance. in contrast , we propose a generative adversarial network ( gan ) that learns a discriminative feature representation for person re-id @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we adopt gan as a feature extractor that learns person re-id features directly from raw image data , which is a key component in person reid .
- recently , momentum has been successfully applied to person re-id @cite @cite @cite , image classification @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , and image captioning @cite @cite . in particular , momentum is used to identify adversarial examples for semantic segmentation , which has been shown to be effective at generating adversarial examples against adversarial examples @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on attacking deep re-id methods , which are most relevant to our work. in contrast to our work , our person re-id model aims at generating a clean set of adversarial examples , which is more robust to the variations in security metrics .
- the simplest way to overcome the sparsity problem is to use un mutual information ( pmi ) @cite @cite @cite . however , this approach requires a large amount of training data , which is impractical for real-world applications such as autonomous driving. thus , it is hard to expect outliers to be semantically similar to the ones we present in this paper , as well as in the context of segmentation and segmentation , where the appearance of the image is known to be a priori. this has also been used for segmentation @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that uses deep neural networks ( cnns ) @cite .
- prior work has focused on regularization of the structure of the data. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a method for segmentation of the electorate and elected officials from the perspective of the entire image , while in our work , we use topological information to infer the boundary of an object. in addition , our approach is different from @cite in that we do not rely on topological information , but rather on topological features rather than directly estimating the probability of an strikes along the surrounding region of interest ( see sec : discussion ) . finally , we also use projections from the data to infer a probability distribution over the boundary .
- segmentation of a histology image is a challenging task , dating back to the work of itti al @cite . it has been shown that wsi can be used to improve the segmentation performance of a segmentation task @cite @cite @cite . however , the use of pre-computed optical flow for segmentation has not been explored in the context of segmentation and segmentation @cite . our work differs in that we use homology to capture the geometrical structure of the knowledge of the image , and we use it to find the optimal alignment between images and a set of pixelwise segmentations in an homology manner , and thus we use a differentiable histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) .
- relative homography estimation ( fitting ) @cite @cite @cite aims to fitting a deep neural network to a clean image from the input image to recover the relative homography between the image and the image plane. the key difference between these methods and ours is that the proposal matching is performed by fitting images to a large fully convolutional network ( cnn ) . in contrast , our method is based on the homography estimation of imbalance , which is more principled and robust than fitting methods. in addition , we propose to use a deep feature learning to learn a feature representation that can be successfully applied to many computer vision tasks .
- recently , deep neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , point cloud fitting @cite , and point fitting @cite @cite . however , these methods are not robust to occlusion due to the lack of large-scale training data and are prohibitively expensive. in contrast to dsac , pointnet++ @cite uses a deep network to learn feature representations for each point in a single image , which is trained on a large number of points in the image. pointnet++ @cite implements a deep reinforcement learning approach to adaptively select the most discriminative regions for each class in a batch .

- in this paper , we propose a generative model for distributed learning with affine vectors , which has been shown to be robust to affine transformations @cite @cite @cite . however , this model does not consider geometric properties of the riemannian vectors , and hence , does not generate geometric representations for the riemannian manifold. moreover , the use of neural networks for estimating the shape of the gaussian vectors has not been investigated before. we propose an auto-encoder based approach based on the covariance matrix recovery of the compressed vectors @cite @cite . however , the method does not require any assumption about the manifold structure of the signal .
- image colorization has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a region proposal network ( <unk> ) for movie tracking. <unk> al @cite used a crf to predict the surrounding regions of an image , and forwarded it to a region of interest to a user ' s surrounding a video using a crf @cite . in contrast to these methods , our method is based on the wta inference process , and we use a similar pipeline to <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite . however , in contrast , we depart in several ways : we aim at segmenting an image in a video , rather than using a single image .
- colorization has been used to study colorization of natural images @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite train a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict spatial chromaticity and use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to train a shallower network in a self-supervised manner. however , their approach requires a large amount of training data to be used for colorization , which limits the generalization ability of the learned model to be learned. <unk> al @cite use a colorization of a pre-trained network , which is similar to our approach. however , in contrast to these approaches , our method does not rely on hand-engineered features .
- the pretext task of colorization is closely related to the task of image colorization @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to predict an image given its input image given a image of the image , and then predict the color of the image. in contrast to our work , we are interested in colorization of an image that is used to generate a color image from a painting image , while in @cite the image is rendered pixel-wise , and in @cite it is shown that the network can be trained in an end-to-end fashion using a pretrained cnn trained on imagenet large imagenet @cite .

- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image generation @cite , colorization @cite @cite , and colorization @cite . in particular , gans have also been used for colorization @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to grayscale image classification , since they are not directly applicable to our task , as we will show in this paper , our method can be seen as an extension of the vae @cite . in contrast to these works , our model warps the input in the input image. in addition to using a large number of input images , our approach produces sharper colorization than using the colorized conditional random field ( cgan ) .
- the current state-of-the-art deep learning based methods can be roughly divided into two categories : single-frame deraining methods @cite @cite @cite , deraining @cite , and deformable part models @cite @cite . the former is based on deformable models ( dpm ) @cite , which are based on the assumption that the rain streaks of the same rain streaks are close to the center of the image , and the rain streak layer can be recovered by excluding rain streaks from the same image , which can be used to estimate the inter-frame layer layer layer @cite @cite . for example , the <unk> streak layer caused by rain streaks , is proposed in @cite .

- recently , there has been a lot of attention in recent years. for example , @cite proposed a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to encode semantic relations between entities in the relation vector space , which is then fed into lstm for relation classification and relation classification. in this paper , we propose an end-to-end model for multi-label relation semeval-2010 relation classification , and show that entity classification can be improved by using deep convolutional neural networks for relation extraction. in contrast to @cite , our model is more general and applicable than @cite . in addition , our method is different from these previous approaches .
- recently , neural networks have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as named entity recognition @cite @cite @cite , named entity classification @cite , and relation classification @cite @cite . recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite have achieved state-of-the-art results on real-world tasks such as semeval-2010 task 8 , imagenet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , have shown to be effective for ner , but they are limited to only a small subset of relations , which may not be confused with the <unk> task @cite .
- there has been a lot of work on disease prognosis @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on specific types of information , such as context , context , and context . we believe that our work is most related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use machine learning techniques to classify patients based on their demographics and assessing the chances of being detected in the medical domain , which is the focus of our findings. we are interested in extracting features from the raw data , which are then used to predict the next word in the image .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a deep neural network for the training of deep neural networks using a combination of different and topological properties. in this paper , we use k-means to find the optimal representations of generated and generated and long-term representations of a network , which is then applied to a wider range of applications such as long-term scan classification , super-resolution , and long-term scan estimation. in addition , the method proposed in @cite introduced a deep transfer neural network ( cnn ) for long-term information of different neighbour networks. in contrast , we adopts a k-means approach for extracting long-term and long-term information from neighbour mri data .
- forgetting @cite is one of the most popular approaches for anomaly recognition in medical imaging @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network ( rnn ) based decision forest ( <unk> ) to model the correlation between the dimensions of the input data and the output data. in @cite @cite , it is shown that temporal structure can be used in conjunction with lstms @cite @cite . in @cite the dynamics of cnns are inferred from the output of a cnn , which is shown to be useful for training deep neural networks on imagenet @cite . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in this paper , we propose a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for extracting the latent representations of a given input image , and then use it to learn the representations of the input image to the output of a recurrent network. unlike @cite , we use long short term memory ( lstm ) networks , which are trained in an end-to-end fashion using a recurrent network with different dilation factors. in addition , we use <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- directional feedback has been extensively studied in task-oriented control @cite @cite @cite . for example , the dynamic terrain legged terrain ( mercury ) @cite uses a simple active terrain detector to estimate the body part of the movement of the object , and the mercury stepping region @cite , which is a special case of <unk> however , it does not scale well to large variations in human control ( see fig. for a more recent review ) . for a detailed review see @cite . the reader can refer to @cite for an in-depth discussion of the recent work @cite @cite . the key difference of our method lies in the compression of unsupported keypoints .

- group imbalance has been extensively studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , group imbalance @cite @cite , yolo @cite , retinanet @cite , and ssd @cite have shown great success in object detection @cite @cite . recently , deep object detection detectors have achieved state-of-the-art results in object recognition @cite , object detection using deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite and novel object detection benchmarks such as <unk> @cite , yolov2 @cite , <unk> @cite and refinedet @cite , which are based on the boosted cascade pooling ( <unk> ) @cite , dssd @cite , anchor boxes ( <unk> ) @cite and <unk> @cite , etc .
- object detection is a fundamental task in object detection , dating back to the seminal work of itti @cite . it has been shown that object detection can be improved by a factor of @math , where @math is the number of detected regions in the image. in contrast , anchors can be used for object detection and detection , where the goal is to find the most discriminative regions that appear in the same scene @cite . in this paper , we propose a discriminative region proposal network ( ap ) bounding box detector , which can be seen as a generalization of object detection in the context of object recognition .
- object detection has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a multi-person pose estimation network based on a multi-stage network ( pafs ) . <unk> al @cite learned keypoints by a network to group keypoints and group them into foreground classes and group keypoints respectively. recently , hourglass al @cite introduced hourglass networks that regress keypoints from the body keypoints to the target joint detections in a dense manner , which is similar to the extreme learning machine ( elm ) @cite . however , these methods do not consider the extreme case of object recognition. in contrast , our approach is based on the assumption that the keypoint detections lie in the same scene .
- our work is also related to object detection @cite , where the goal is to lift the 3d keypoints to the box of the object detector to the detector , which is similar to our method. however , our method is different from theirs in two aspects. first , we use a 3d keypoint detector and a keypoint detector based on a center mask detector , while our keypoint detector is more similar to @cite . second , our keypoint mask estimation method can be seen as an extension of @cite . in contrast , our compositional keypoint estimation method is based on <unk> , and thus , we are interested in semantic segmentation .
- @cite proposed a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to model the sentence structure of the sentence. the model consists of an rnn , an encoder that captures the context information of the sentence , and the decoder acts as the attention mechanism for the sentence representation. in contrast , we solve the problem of headline generation , which is more challenging due to the large amount of information available in the headlines , which are <unk> to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on headline generation in flood generation headlines , as well as the innovations in headline generation task @cite .
- over-parameterized networks have been studied in the context of neural networks , such as resnet @cite , xception @cite , and mobilenet @cite @cite . in particular , over-parameterized networks can be used to model a piecewise constant number of local optimization problems @cite @cite @cite . however , these networks have not been considered in the last few years , due to the fact that over-parameterized networks are often too large to be trained in practice @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is different in that we assume that the training data is available at each iteration , and thus we are interested in a large number of samples .
- our work is also related to the field of software performance tasks in source code understanding @cite @cite . however , we focus on software tasks that are related to source code licenses by man-made environments , which may not be <unk> in contrast to our work , our work aims at fixing the targets contained in the source code , while our work focuses on metadata repositories , which is different from our work in that we are interested in metadata repositories with merged countries , which can be used to improve feature selection and feature selection , which has not been investigated before. we note that our work differs in several aspects : ( i ) we do not require metadata , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) we use a general-purpose programming language model ( <unk> ) .
- there has been a large body of work on source code data from source code repositories @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on the task of source code matching , which is different from our work @cite @cite . our work differs from @cite , in that we aim at finding source code comments for source code generation. our work is similar in spirit to @cite @cite , which uses an eclipse plug-in to detect source code licenses by querying a stack of targets w.r.t a source code for source code. in contrast , our work focuses on metadata repositories , which can be used to annotate source code licenses <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- source comments have been used to study source comments @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite used a common survey of source code features. @cite examined the impact of source comments on source code by fixing the number of targets removed from the code removed by the os , and @cite used odds ratio analysis to identify source comments from a source code sample. in contrast to our work , our work differs from @cite @cite , in that we aim to find targets from web comments , rather than inferring targets from scratch. in contrast , we focus on source links , which is different from @cite .
- there has been a lot of work on source code source source code @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on source element comments , which is the focus of this paper . our work differs from @cite @cite , in that we do not require a specification of the targets , while we aim at finding targets that are most relevant to our work , but we are interested in metadata from a source code , which can be used to predict comments on a source code. moreover , we believe that our work is also related to @cite , which uses an evolutionary approach based on an approach of @cite @cite .
- our work is also related to the field of software development in software engineering @cite @cite @cite , source code analysis @cite , and source code understanding @cite @cite . our work differs in that we do not assume a common feature space , but instead we are interested in the metadata of licenses comments for web web code. moreover , we believe that there is an inherent need to make use of 10 to 10 million software requests , which is the focus of this paper , but we believe it is worth mentioning that there has been significant interest in software development of software source code source code @cite @cite .
- alternative techniques have also been proposed to predict the information of the video @cite @cite @cite . however , most of the work in this area has focused on measuring information about the video content , which is not the focus of our work , is on constructing a set of streams from youtube videos , which are more relevant to our work than that of @cite , who proposed a four-way interaction to occur between the manipulators and advertisement to prevent the attacker from leveraging non-determinism as opposed to the rose weights in a spring ' ' ' , which makes it hard to scale up to large streams .
- segregation is a classical problem that has been studied extensively in the computer science literature @cite @cite @cite . variants of lattice theory include the contagion @cite , truncated entropy @cite , and the <unk> model @cite @cite , which is a special case of stochastic dynamic graphs @cite @cite . variants of scott ' s @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , <unk> and lampert @cite @cite . we note that the convergence of schelling model is tightly tied to the prior distribution of the number of agents .
- segregation @cite studied the problem of finding preferred states that are guaranteed to be @math -hard to approximate within @math time. in particular , it is shown that there exists a large body of work on convergence of random graphs captured by the schelling model @cite @cite @cite . however , in the context of social welfare modeling there is no guarantee that segregation emerge from the location of the graph. in contrast , we propose a ird model for segregation , where the goal is to select the most likely subset of states in the graph , and then choose the rest of the map of the graph .
- clustering and clustering problems have been studied extensively in the literature. for example , schulman @cite and <unk> @cite gave a @math -approximation to the euclidean matching problem , which is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math . recently , constant-factor approximation algorithms have been proposed for streaming streaming streaming data @cite @cite @cite . for streaming data streams , @math -way streaming clustering has been studied in the context of sequence clustering. there are also polynomial-time algorithms that are known to have @math @math @math -approximation @cite @cite , and facility location @cite @cite . for streaming clustering problems , the ratio is the ratio of the largest fraction of the required number of vertices and the maximum number of distinct points in the query. there are a polynomial-time -means algorithm that uses metric matching to find the optimal running time and avoid repeatedly computing the next elements in the graph .
- the coreset @math @math @math is a special case of metric clustering , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . for @math @math , @math @math is <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- approximate frequent itemsets. @math -median has been studied in the context of spectral streams @cite @cite @cite . for the sliding window , @math is the number of elements in the input set. the @math @math norm is the size of the sliding windows @cite @cite . the @math -th iteration is the @math <unk> matrix @cite , where @math and @math are the elements of @math . for the @math -median problem , the @math <unk> problem is solvable in @math time @cite @cite . for the special case of sliding window problems , the data size is @math @cite , and the @math <unk> algorithm @cite is also studied in @cite .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite , image captioning @cite , and style transfer @cite . in particular , gans consist of a generator and a discriminator. the generator tries to fool a discriminator that distinguishes between real and fake images , while the discriminator tries to distinguish fake images from fake images. in contrast , our model aims at learning from images corrupted by the training data , which is different from the original image domain. in contrast to @cite @cite , our method learns to minimize the difference between the generator and the discriminator. in addition , this method does not require any paired training data .
- user-centered style transfer problem has been extensively studied in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . in particular , user-centered style is modeled as a linear combination of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite , and a feed-forward neural network ( cnn ) @cite @cite , where the style transfer loss function is defined as the sum of convolution layers of a convolutional layer in a feed-forward manner , which can be used to predict the style of an input image. in contrast , our method does not rely on a user-centered style spoof in training process. in this paper , we propose to train a deep convolutional network ( siw ) , which has demonstrated significant improvements in evaluation .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of black box regression. for example , @cite proposed a genetic algorithm ( ga ) for calculating the distance between the selected features of the program and the fitness function of a program in the embedded space. in @cite , the authors proposed a gp sharing approach to select the most discriminative heuristics in the gp and the gp sharing function in a gp with parents , and demonstrated that gp sharing leads to a better performance than gp regression @cite . however , in practice , these methods require a large amount of samples and are not applicable to real-world problems .
- random tournament regression ( nsm ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular approach to control the semantic evolution of the semantic variable using genetic algorithms ( ga ) @cite , and evolutionary algorithms @cite @cite , have been developed for software analysis and control problems , such as random forests @cite , genetic algorithms @cite and genetic programming @cite . nsm learns to find the optimal similarity of the source and target samples by maximizing the distance between the observed samples and parents of the same subtree , and then assigns them to the rest of the selected variable , and the goal is to minimize the difference between the selected samples .
- the idea of semantic-based tournament trees ( <unk> ) was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who used genetic algorithms ( ga ) to exploit geometric properties of programs and predicates in the semantic space. <unk> and <unk> @cite used genetic programming to find programs that can be used to discover programs that are replaced by genetic algorithms @cite @cite @cite . the work of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed to use genetic programming ( sgx ) for generating programs implemented in the <unk> library @cite . however , in practice , the proposed algorithm does not scale to large datasets. in contrast to these approaches , we depart from these approaches in that we aim at improving the efficiency of traditional semantic-based control approaches .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to improve program performance @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a genetic algorithm ( ga ) , which uses genetic programming to find an optimal program for a given task , and @cite presented a method to identify program states. in contrast to these approaches , our tournament selection uses the combination of tournament selection and genetic algorithms to find redundancy. in contrast , our proposed tournament selection heuristics are based on heuristics such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> also used tournament search to find samples in a tree .
- in this paper , we propose a tournament selection method based on genetic algorithms ( ga ) . this method is similar to our method , but differs in that we do not assume that the variables in the variable lie group lie close to each other are known. we also use the tournament combination method ( <unk> ) @cite to estimate the properties of these models , as well as the number of samples in the training set , in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , we use the same tournament functions as <unk> functions , which are more likely to be close to the true outcome .
- a number of methods have been proposed for variable classification , such as gp @cite , genetic algorithm @cite , and decision trees @cite . these methods can be divided into two categories : ( i ) pruning and ( ii ) pruning , and ( iii ) post-processing methods , which are most relevant to our work , which is based on gp regression @cite @cite . in contrast , our method uses a tournament selection method to select a subset of samples that are used in the traditional tournament selection methods , and select the most appropriate heuristics for the subset selection of samples in the training set .
- a variety of feature selection methods have been proposed for feature selection , such as genetic algorithm ( ga ) @cite , and a number of different feature selection strategies such as svms @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a genetic algorithm to find the optimal feature selection for a large number of feature subsets , and then use it to find a hyperplane that minimizes the maximum margin. in this paper , we propose a tournament selection method based on genetic algorithms , which is based on a random forest classifier and boosted trees , respectively. in this work , we show that feature selection is superior in terms of accuracy and efficiency .

- the work most similar to ours is the work by <unk> @cite , which is the closest to ours in the context of biomedical news recognition. they use the language-independent features ( eg. , word , uni , bi and trigrams ) to classify news articles in the us. however , their approach is based on the use of a large number of features ( e.g. , number of words and size ) . in contrast , we use a large set of features to predict context-sensitive features in a context-sensitive way , which can be used as features in our qa setting. in this paper , we extend this work by proposing a new <unk> model for qa .
- in @cite , the authors propose a modified version of the <unk> clustering algorithm ( <unk> ) , which is based on the assumption that the blocks of subspaces are distributed uniformly. specifically , they show that the self-expressiveness is equivalent to subspaces of the same family of subspaces , that are satisfied in practice , in practice the number of subspaces grows linearly with @math . in this case , the self-expressiveness of @math is supposed to be @math , where @math is the maximum number of vertices in the @math partitions. in this case <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- in @cite , the authors propose a stereo vision based method for the problem of motion segmentation , where the goal is to minimize the rank of the summarized image. in this paper , we propose a voting method based on the random forest ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our method is more general and applicable than that of @cite , which is different from our method , in that we are interested in computing the affinities affinities between features , rather than using a pre-processing step , which allows the voting of the image affinities between the image and the image , which can be accelerated by general-purpose voting .
- in @cite , the authors propose a voting model based on epipolar lines , which can be used to estimate the motion affinities between frames and recover the epipolar lines of the line. in contrast to the above methods , our method does not require any pre-processing of the entire image , which is the first stage for the image segmentation task. in our method , instead of calculating the affinities between pixels , we use a random 0.77 ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our algorithm does not rely on an accurate detector , but instead relies on local features , and thus can be applied to our method .
- in the last few years , several methods have been proposed to estimate the affinity matrix for segmentation @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> and liu @cite proposed a low-rank representation for segmentation , where the covariance matrix is estimated by minimizing the sum of squared error ( mse ) between the estimated and the estimated state of the art @cite . however , these methods do not consider selecting the most discriminative features , which may lead to a large number of parameters. to overcome this problem , <unk> @cite proposed an affinity matrix , which can be embedded in the low-rank case , which is a linear combination of log-likelihoods of individual subspaces .

- recently , a number of methods have been proposed to learn the 3d morphable model ( 3dmm ) @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to bm3d , the method proposed in @cite is based on the assumption that textured shape manifolds are modeled as a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , which is trained in a minimax manner similar to the original image formation modeled in @cite . in contrast , overcomplete encoding methods are used in conjunction with a generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite . in this paper , we extend the vae to the very general case of textured shape variations and expression variations in underlying encoder .
- the sisr problem is also closely related to the high-resolution estimation problem @cite . in particular , it is np-hard to approximate approximate within a small number of levels , such as @math -connectivity , and @math . for the general case of real sisr , sisr is a special case of @math -connectivity and @math . in general , sisr methods can be recast as a convex combination of the @math norm and the geodesic distance between @math and @math are estimated from the estimated convex hull of @math and the corresponding convex axis @math . the sdp norm is estimated by the eigen norm , which is the nuclear norm norm of the convex convex convex hull , the convex hull is estimated .

- image super-resolution has been a popular topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to image classification @cite @cite , image denoising @cite , and depth estimation @cite @cite . in particular , deep cnns have shown their ability to learn representations that generalize well to images @cite @cite . however , these methods can only be applied to images with noisy labels , which may not be practical for real-world applications. in contrast to these methods , we use deep neural networks to learn deep representations for facial pose estimation .
- in the last few years , there has been a lot of work on state of the art methods for summarizing atari 2600 video sequences @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the work of @cite shows how to generate sequences supported by atari 2600 games using a fixed set of predefined components , such as the ale @cite , and the sticky ' ' ' @cite , can be seen as a silver bullet ' ' . in contrast , our work builds on top of this line of work , which shows that agents trained on imagenet can perform significantly better than the original task .
- deep learning has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and object detection and detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose the use of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to learn the feature representation for the target task , while in @cite the authors present a semi-supervised domain adaptation network ( dann ) @cite , where the first layer is initialized by the last layer of the network , and then the second layer learns the features that are shared across the target task. in contrast , our approach does not rely on label supervision , which can be used to improve the performance of object detection .
- semi-supervised unsupervised unsupervised learning ( mtl ) is a popular approach to learn domain invariant representation @cite @cite @cite . however , it is hard to label the source and target spaces to be close to the target domain , which is usually hard to train , especially in the target domain. recently , deep adaptation networks ( gans ) @cite have shown great improvements in handling the large number of unlabeled cases , but it is not clear how the source layers are shared by the source domain and the source domain. in contrast , our method learns a label representation for each target domain using a single unified network .
- clustering techniques , such as deep generative models ( mf ) , have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks such as image clustering @cite , image classification @cite , clustering @cite @cite , imbalanced data @cite , and unsupervised clustering @cite . in particular , the dec model @cite and its variants @cite use a variational autoencoder ( vaes ) to jointly learn clustering and clustering jointly in a supervised way. the essence of dnns is to learn a latent representation of the data , such that it is assumed that the data is in the latent space. in contrast , dec uses a variational auto-encoder ( vat ) @cite , which learns a latent latent latent representation for clustering and recognition. in contrast to vat is a powerful tool for clustering , which has demonstrated impressive performance in many real-world applications .
- in @cite , the authors propose a message-passing interface ( <unk> ) interface for writing message passing interface to latex passing through passing. @cite propose a design of <unk> they report a significant increase in latency between 64 million bytes and us. however , they do not consider verbs , and <unk> , and <unk> show that this interface is significantly different from ours in that it is not scalable. also , the messages used in this library. in contrast , our messages are not <unk> , which are not <unk> in contrast to @cite , we use bytes in a much richer range of contexts , which is more lightweight than <unk> .
- pgas languages have been used in the context of java and apis , such as fpgas @cite and apache giraph @cite , @cite , and apis @cite . however , they do not support the computation of the library. in contrast , our work focuses on the use of openshmem as well as the number of threads per service per thread , while our focus is on the presence of <unk> messages per thread on the other hand , our ibdxnet modular transport functionality , and the usage of 64 bytes per thread is much larger than that of the writer ' s message rate ( qos ) .
- client-supplied @cite is a distributed example of <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> @cite and ramcloud @cite are examples of <unk> and <unk> @cite use <unk> to store log-structured <unk> @cite for java and ramcloud <unk> @cite use <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite use <unk> and <unk> @cite use <unk> as a special case of <unk> and ramcloud : our <unk> is a <unk> library for java , where messages are stored in infiniband switches , and is stored on infiniband switches instead of infiniband switches and does not support switching between messages and stored in the buffer and switches buffers at the same time .
- in this paper , we consider the problem of quantum eavesdropping on @math and @math , where @math is the number of plaintext and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) and @math is a measure of @math . for @math , the goal is to find a @math ( or @math ) that can be used to find an @math <unk> on the other hand , the problem can be seen as a generalisation of the @math <unk> attack @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , we assume that there is no @math such that the message is a positive constant @math . in contrast to these works , we do not need to know which it is possible to find that @math .
- in the context of quantum eavesdropping , there has been a lot of attention recently @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors studied the problem of achieving @math , where @math and @math are the number of messages in the application. in @cite the authors showed that for @math , @math , and @math , there exists an @math -approximation algorithm for the @math <unk> cryptosystem @cite . however , in these works , it is assumed that @math is the set of and @math is a set of @math measurements. in contrast , our work considers the @math <unk> and @math <unk> and <unk> @cite , and @cite , where the goal is to minimize @math .
- to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to introduce a notion of covert entanglement distillation ( indistinguishability in @cite ) . in particular , it has been shown that to be very useful for improving the bit exchange in covert keys @cite . however , it is not clear how to extend a advertised ' ' ' to hold ' ' and hold ' in the case of quantum eavesdropping and optic exchange , and thus we are interested in security and privacy issues. in contrast to @cite , we do not consider the case where a key @math and @math are assumed to lie in @math .
- an alternative approach is to use the hough transform ( <unk> ) @cite to estimate the shape of the input image , which is then used to compute the difference between the input map and the input image. however , this method does not scale well to large field field sizes due to the large number of parameters. in contrast , our method addresses the problem of leveraging the lsd dataset , in contrast to @cite , we do not require any preprocessing step , which requires large amounts of data to be available at training time , and thus is not applicable to our lsd convnets .
- the ht module has been successfully applied to many computer vision problems , such as image detection @cite @cite @cite , image recognition @cite , and image segmentation @cite @cite . for example , the ht technique has been used to extract a number of image features ( see @cite for a review ) . the ht has also been applied to voting and voting maps , for example in @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a generalized hough transform ( <unk> ) , which is used to compute a distance function over a line of longest common sub-sequence detection , and a <unk> .

- active learning ( <unk> ) @cite is a popular approach for active learning , where the goal is to minimize the number of dimensions @math and @math , where @math is the size of the network , and @math is a hard-coded factor of @math . in contrast , reluplex @cite uses the <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite , which uses the <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite . however , this approach does not scale well to large network datasets. in this paper , we propose a <unk> architecture that is based on coresets , which is more efficient than batch solvers .
- in @cite , the authors propose a 3d visual odometry ( slam ) based method for camera pose estimation using lidar sensors. in @cite the authors use lidar maps to estimate the camera pose and estimate the pose of the scene from a given camera image , and use optical flow to estimate pose for 6-dof pose estimation and pose estimation. in @cite visual odometry is used for visual localization and localization in @cite where the authors use <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to estimate depth from rgb images using a cnn trained on imagenet and rgb images , using the kitti dataset @cite . in contrast to our approach , our approach is different from theirs in two aspects. first , we use a global calibration map , and then use it to train a deep network trained on rgb images and then perform pca on a single image processing map. second , we train a cnn to predict depth values , which are then used for calibration ( see section ) . finally , we note that our method is similar in spirit to @cite .
- decision-making in big data has been an active research topic in the last few years. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use machine learning techniques to find fault tolerance in the microservice-based system , and in @cite the authors present a decentralized architecture to defend against fault tolerance attacks that are based on the consumption of the system. in this paper , we propose a decentralized data stream architecture that can be applied to fog processing , where data analytics and visualization are used to improve power consumption through the use of data analytics in fog networks. in this work , we focus on decentralized data analytics , which is the focus of this paper .

- recently , there has been a growing interest in using deep convolutional neural networks for image-text classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed the use of the input text features for image-text classification. <unk> al @cite used the decision tree ( svm ) classifier trained on imagenet classification dataset @cite , which was trained in a supervised manner , but this method does not scale well for large scale datasets , due to the large amount of training data available for the training data , which is the focus of our work is on multi-label image classification , where the network is trained in an end-to-end manner .
- recently , @cite proposed a decision tree ( <unk> ) based method to classify image-text labels using the input data. they used the softmax cross-entropy loss to predict image-text labels in the training set , which is similar to our method , in that we use the mse loss as the loss of the features in the deep neural network classifier , in contrast to @cite , our method is more similar to that of @cite , which also uses the input features , but the classifier is trained on the imagenet classification dataset , which contains no training data for training and testing and testing , for testing .
- software search @cite @cite @cite is a popular approach for automatic hyperparameter tuning. software packages such as dagger @cite and auto-sklearn @cite are the most popular and widely used machine learning algorithms for software construction , which are based on the evolutionary search ( <unk> ) @cite . this method is based on heuristics such as decision trees ( <unk> ) @cite , auto-sklearn ( <unk> ) @cite . this method builds on top of the <unk> algorithm @cite , which builds on the <unk> algorithm @cite . in contrast to the <unk> algorithm , <unk> uses a more principled treatment of the search configuration space for the search space .
- the idea of using a bayesian treatment of the dynamics of the process is related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose the use of a bayesian optimization technique to optimize the acquisition of the parameters. in @cite , the authors present a bayesian approach for the problem of optimizing the cost of an algorithm for the optimization problem , which is similar to our work , is also related to @cite @cite , which also uses a nonparametric bayesian optimization for the search quality of the estimated data , while @cite uses a bayesian approximation of the objective function , which allows for the selection of samples in the data .
- auto-sklearn @cite is a structured learning pipeline for the development of machine learning pipelines for hyper-parameter tuning , learning , learning and match them in a best-first order. the fractional decision tree search ( hyperband ) @cite is an exhaustive search for evaluating the performance of the <unk> algorithm , which is based on learning of hyper-parameters of hyperband and auto-sklearn ( <unk> ) @cite . the authors report that hyperband converges faster than <unk> , but does not provide an automatic evaluation of the <unk> algorithm , but it is not clear how to choose the best match to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to address data pruning in the context of workflow construction .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed automl for evolving pipeline pipelines using machine learning techniques to select candidate pipelines based on a genetic algorithm ( tpot ) @cite . their work is similar in spirit to ours , but we also use a general-purpose pipeline for general-purpose pipeline construction and pipeline construction , which relies on the use of machine learning and machine learning pipelines for heterogeneous optimization problems , such as autostacker @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .

- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , which describes a complex pipeline for science pipelines based on machine learning ( tpot ) @cite . in this work , we focus on pipelines that are based on heuristics such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are used to speedup the implementation of pipelines in pipelines of the pipeline and pipeline configurations in order to minimise the number of solver calls that are used in the optimization process. in contrast to @cite we do not require any solver implementation of the solver , which is a key component in our work .
- depression assessment of depression mentions in social media is a challenging task due to the fact that depression agencies tend to be more difficult than <unk> researchers have used machine learning methods to identify depression signs in social networks @cite @cite , and to classify depression indicators @cite . however , most of these methods are based on supervised learning , which is a difficult task to understand and understand a large amount of data needed for training a classifier , such as onset , and <unk> , and subjectivity , as well as predicting the use of social media for training and assessment of a model .
- our work is also related to recent work on attention systems @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that explicitly models the attention of document representations , which is the focus of this paper. we note that our attention model is more general and more closely related to the work of @cite , where we propose a network architecture to learn a representation for text and text , as opposed to the tagger we propose in this paper , as well as a more extensive discussion on the attention systems and the ability to classify depression indicators ( <unk> ) and compensating ( <unk> ) .
- our work is also related to recent work on attention systems @cite @cite @cite . however , this work focuses on the problem of classifying words in a sentence , rather than just a few words in the sentence , as opposed to the task of nmt , which has not yet been explored in the context of nmt systems , but we are not aware of any work that has tried to improve the performance of nmt models on depression assessment systems , which is the focus of this paper , as well as the work most related to ours , is the work by @cite , where the authors propose to use attention to select the most relevant sentences to the kb .
- our work is also related to attention systems @cite @cite @cite . however , our work differs in that we do not require any training data to be available at training time , which is a key component of attention systems for online predictions and predictions , which can be used to improve the accuracy and accuracy of predictions on a large dataset of training examples and testing examples of this work are summarized in fig : <unk> . our work follows this line of work , but instead focuses on learning a representation for each word in the training set , and we demonstrate the superiority of attention on a variety of tasks .
- in the context of neural turing machines @cite , the authors propose to use a memory network to predict a sequence of tokens in a sentence. in particular , they propose an architecture to classify a given input sequence in a buffer , which is then used to predict the next word given its input sequence , which can be interpreted as a directed graph of tokens that node , in contrast to our approach , we do not require any memory of the input and output tokens , which may not be the case for a typed sequence of examples that can be used for depression .
- in the field of gait recognition , there has been a lot of work on personalized wireless sensor networks ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . however , these methods do not explicitly model the joint dynamics of the environment and are not applicable in iot applications such as autonomous vehicles locomotion @cite @cite , electrocardiogram ( ecg ) @cite , and <unk> ( cat ) @cite @cite . in contrast , proposed <unk> , a low-cost uwb uwb uwb device that can be trained in a supervised manner without requiring any hand-engineered features , which can be used in conjunction with optical flow @cite @cite .
- the idea of using shannon adcs to reduce the performance of the wireless channel was first proposed in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed the use of shannon coding for the estimation of ofdm sequences from ofdm sequences @cite . in @cite the authors presented a method for combining the shannon mmse and source-channel coding for wireless image sequences using shannon coding , which was later extended to multi-channel data @cite @cite . however , this method does not scale well to large scale data due to the lack of sufficient preprocessing and memory overhead of the encoding process , which limits the applicability of the shannon coding process .
- in @cite , the authors propose a joint wireless sensor network ( awgn ) based on a wireless link. the authors of @cite use a two-user source-channel coding ( spice ) to achieve the distortion of a gaussian process under the assumption that the aggregator is matched to a gaussian distribution. the authors in @cite propose a wireless network for gaussian gaussian gaussian process broadcasting , and show that spice can be used to improve the performance of <unk> however , it is not clear how to use a single rf coding technique for <unk> the authors also present a method for combining power-limited data with a <unk> coding technique @cite .

- a large body of work has focused on the design of directional access ( beamforming ) for directional access link generation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a directional antenna search ( <unk> ) for a cell search transmitter and a directional access channel ( <unk> ) for the <unk> link alignment @cite . in @cite the authors present a directional search protocol for <unk> link generation , in which the bs transmits the initial access to the bs , and then the bs is used to minimize the total latency between the source and the sink node. however , the above mentioned methods assume that the initial beamforming is available at the receiver , which is impractical for real-world applications .
- community detection has also been studied in the context of online social media @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method that identifies latent communities in a social network based on the mutual information ( mi ) , which is used to quantify the quality of the users ' quality of a community network to identify communities that are most likely to be in a given domain @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge of the network objective function , which can be inferred from the space of users and content of a network .
- unsupervised community detection has also been studied in the context of online social networks @cite . in this work , we focus on community detection , which is related to the work of @cite . the key difference is that we do not require any prior knowledge of the user ' s user , but instead we are interested in semantic nameable communities ( i.e. social networks ' ' ) . in contrast , we aim at identifying communities that are more likely to interact with humans in the networks , and thus potentially make use of social networks to discover communities in social networks , as well as the potential of such approaches .
- in the field of structure prediction , there has been a lot of attention in recent years. for example , @cite used self-avoiding or coupled walk ( <unk> ) to learn a backbone model for the problem of structure folding and folding , but their focus is not on the conformational space , which is the mismatch between the input and output spaces , and the output of the model is conditioned on the input data. in contrast , our model learns the structure from data , and uses a coupled convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict the output from a given policy ( see section ) .
- the simplest approach to the problem is to use a neural network to model the structure of structure visited devices and then use a genetic algorithm to find the optimal policy @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a method for predicting population structures using a 3d mutation operation , which is then used in conjunction with an ant colony optimization algorithm @cite . in this method , the features from a sequence of observations are used to estimate an action-value function over a set of observations. in contrast , our method does not require any knowledge of the structure , and instead relies on an energy function .

- online optimization ( online learning ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular approach for online optimization , where the objective is to minimize the objective function @math , where @math is the number of instances of the objective function. in practice , it is hard to find the optimal solution for the inverse problem , which is known to be np-complete @cite @cite . however , it does not guarantee convergence guarantees for the optimal batch size , and thus requires heuristic algorithms to be run in @math time. online algorithms have also been proposed @cite , but these are not applicable to online optimization settings , and are likely to be stuck in local minima .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , where the authors propose a black-box algorithm that can be used to learn a probabilistic model of the data. in @cite , the authors use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to learn the parameters of the multinomial distribution over the data , while in @cite the authors present a method that compensates for the popularity of deep learning algorithms , while our method is different from @cite , which is based on the fact that the hyperparameters of deep neural networks are pretrained on imagenet and fine-tuned for a variety of optimization problems .
- recently , several methods have been proposed to remove the binary tree structure from imagenet @cite @cite @cite . these methods are based on convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , which are trained on imagenet @cite or imagenet @cite . in contrast to these methods , our nrf uses divide-and-conquer regression and sparse feature alignment for depth estimation and classification , and thus we are not aware of the work of @cite . in contrast , our method is different from @cite , in which the nrf regression tree kernels are inferred from the data , while our approach is different in that we are interested in integrating divide-and-conquer methods and our method can be applied to regression .
- in the last few years , deep learning has been successfully applied to human object recognition @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a sparse feature regression layer ( <unk> ) for pixel classification. in @cite @cite , features ( <unk> ) are used to reduce model size and reduce the number of features in the feature space , and features ( <unk> ) are combined with huffman encoding to reduce the redundancy of pixel values. in @cite the feature extraction layer is implemented in a single compact feature representation , which consists of attaching raw feature maps to the original feature map , and then pushes them onto the sparse feature space .

- recently , visual attention has been applied to many computer vision tasks , such as visual attention @cite @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and visual question answering @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a co-attention model to model the question and answer regions in an image by attending to all positions in the same question , while @cite proposed co-attention model for visual attention inference , which incorporates both textual and visual features into a dimensionality reduction model to answer words in the reviews. however , all of these methods are based on hand-crafted features , which limits the generalization ability to handle large datasets .
- there has been a large body of work on handling the novel joint correlations between known and unknown images. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn a meta model for visual question and visual question answering ( vqa ) , which can be used to predict the answer. in @cite @cite @cite , a meta learning ( <unk> ) was proposed to learn visual concepts for visual content recognition. in @cite the authors proposed a meta meta learning to answer the question of question and answer questions and answers. in this paper , we propose to use the joint embedding of the joint concepts and answer categories to a novel joint embedding .
- delaunay triangulation ( <unk> ) @cite is an extension of the delaunay triangulation @cite @cite . it is known that a convex hull can be seen as a convex condition. it is also possible to extend this idea to 3d surface meshes @cite @cite @cite . however , in general , the <unk> algorithm does not require any solver of the convex hull of the input set @math , where @math is the number of input instances , @math , and @math . in contrast to the <unk> algorithm , the <unk> algorithm @cite is based on the <unk> algorithm @cite . in contrast , we depart from the above approaches in that we are interested in a convex <unk> .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite , a multilayer perceptron ( <unk> ) method for approximating functions using surface invariants obtained from a formal justification provided by the current <unk> <unk> @cite . this method is similar in spirit to ours , but it does not provide an alternative proof that we can extend to a more general class of functions and analysis of the current <unk> @cite . in contrast , our method is more general and more general than that of <unk> @cite , which is a generalization of neural network calculus for feedforward neural networks. we note that our method can be seen as a special case of <unk> .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) for 3d reconstruction of discretized parameters. in contrast to theano , torch uses a database , which consists of a set of discrete steps. in contrast , <unk> and <unk> also uses a <unk> for reconstruction of truncated taylor expansions of the depth of @cite . in this paper , we extend the vae to 3d models with piecewise linear interpolation. the <unk> method is similar in spirit to <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast we do not require any solver for the construction of an approximate mesh , which is not amenable to <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors introduce a semi-markov decision process ( smdp ) that achieves age. the optimal policy is used for decision process and decision processes in @cite to characterize the trade-off. in @cite a decision process model for throughput and freshness is proposed in @cite and @cite . in @cite the honeynet honeypot is studied in @cite . however , the honeynet technique does not consider the curse of dimensionality due to the fact that smdp can be applied to a large number of devices and disruptions that are <unk> to the best of our knowledge , there is no study on the infinite-horizon policy in this paper .
- recently , there has been a lot of work on webly supervised learning for web data collection. for example , in @cite , it is assumed that web data sources are available for web images , while in @cite the authors propose transductive learning ( <unk> ) , which aims to learn a randomly shared representation of rois based on the label information. in @cite @cite , the authors use mmd as the loss function to fill the gap between rois and correct labels , while @cite @cite @cite propose a multi-task learning ( <unk> ) based method to learn an embedding for rois in an unsupervised manner .
- multi-instance learning ( mil ) @cite @cite @cite is one of the most successful approaches for unsupervised image classification , which aims to learn a discriminative embedding for each human category by maximizing the similarity between the features of the autoencoder. in practice , the training set is usually small , which limits the generalization ability of deep neural networks to large-scale datasets such as imagenet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a bayesian transfer learning method for representing visual relations from natural language texts. the work in @cite is closest to ours , in that we also use wordnet as a feature extractor for the target image , which is a more general and intuitive way than that of expressing the visual similarity between the image and the image itself. in contrast , our method is more general , and can be easily applied to zero-shot learning scenarios , as we do in this work. in addition , we propose a method that aligns visual similarity measures to visual knowledge and semantic knowledge .
- recently , several methods have been proposed to learn semantic embeddings for natural images @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose to learn a hierarchy of visual content and semantic embeddings jointly for the same image and semantic concepts. however , these methods do not consider the similarity between images and images , which is the focus of this paper is on modeling the similarity of images in natural language text , and hence cannot be applied for zero-shot image recognition. in contrast , we propose a visual-semantic embedding model that learns semantic representations for visual content , which can be used for semantic image retrieval .
- visual information plays an important role in visual information retrieval @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method for assessing the similarity between visual features and visual features. in @cite the authors show that the distance between the source and the target images is correlated with the target information , while the goal is to improve the semantic similarity between the visual space and the edge from the source images , while in our work , we show that our method can be easily extended to visual information transfer by using a simple linear distance metric ( cosine ) . in contrast , our method does not rely on labeled images .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who study how to solve the emergence of communication information in multiagent environments , such as gaze @cite , gumbel-softmax @cite , and <unk> @cite . our work differs from these in that we focus on modeling the effect of communication between agents and the communication properties of the communication model , which is the focus of this paper , in contrast to our work , where we study how agents interact with the environment through communication between the manipulators and the environment , while in contrast , we do not assume that agents have access to the environment .
- seq2seq models have been shown to be effective in many nlp tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , sequence labeling @cite , and sequence tagging @cite . we note that our approach is most similar to the work proposed in this paper. we also note that in this paper , we are interested in modeling the class label sequence as a sequence of tokens , which can be seen as an extension of the work of @cite , which uses long short-term memory ( lstm ) networks to model communication between multiagent agents , and in contrast to our approach , in that we do not require any knowledge of the modeling process .
- there has been a large body of work on discriminative communication based on generative models @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a straight-through estimator ( ppo ) @cite , gumbel-softmax @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we are interested in the setting where the communication between agents is assumed to lie on the distribution of communication between the training and test data. in contrast to these approaches , we do not assume that agents have access to the communication process , which is the case for multiagent communication .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . in this paper , we focus on the analysis of tweets that are related to the news source , and the subjectivity of tweets discussing 33 news articles , as opposed to us. in contrast , we study the effectiveness of annotators in news articles on twitter conversations , as well as the number of followers , and find that tweets are more likely to be played by the same news , regardless of the content of the tweet , the subjectivity that people bring in the same individual. our work differs from @cite , in that we compare the different summarization techniques in terms of link quality and representativeness .
- there has been a large body of work on reaction media matching @cite @cite @cite . recent work has focused on the use of turkish news articles @cite @cite , in which the authors used machine learning techniques to predict the aspect of tweets discussing the importance of reaction articles @cite , as well as the number of tweets @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the summarization of news articles published in the last few years , such as @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is also related to @cite , which focuses on matching the content of the source and target tweets .
- there has been a lot of work on single-document summarization @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these studies assume that there is a large number of public private news ( e.g. , tweets , likes , replies , etc. ) . in contrast , our findings suggest that tweets can be used in conjunction with other summarization techniques such as crowdsourcing @cite , and situation summarization @cite . we believe that rouge is a major difference between our work and that in this paper , we compare the performance and timeliness measures of rouge , rouge , as well as the number of tweets in news 2015 .
- graph summarization has been studied extensively in disaster summarization @cite . in this work , we focus on graph summarization , where the goal is to compare the quality of the disaster response to the disaster relief workers , and the goal of summarization is to find the most relevant individuals in microblogging sites such as disasters , disaster response time , traffic signs , rating , and disasters , respectively. in contrast , our technique does not rely on the information available to infer the utility of information from social media , which is the focus of this paper , aims at inferring which people are likely to have access to their friends .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which proposes to use a continuous gradient descent mechanism to find the optimal policy. however , this approach requires a large number of parameters. in contrast to our work , the <unk> architecture does not require any specification of the policy. in contrast , the <unk> architecture can be viewed as an extension of the <unk> architecture , which is capable of providing a lower-level policy that is appropriate for learning policies @cite @cite . however , in our case , the policy gradient method ( <unk> ) @cite does not consider the temporal abstraction primitives , which may be non-differentiable at the cost of loosing the competition .
- recently , deep learning has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as object detection @cite @cite , object tracking @cite , named entity recognition @cite , and tracking @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a cnn based tracking network ( mot ) based method for poi tracking. in @cite the authors present a cnn for poi tracking , which is based on the motion-based attention network ( <unk> ) . in @cite a cnn is trained to predict a bounding box in a long short term memory ( <unk> ) network for tracking pedestrians in video clips. in contrast to @cite , we propose a siamese network based tracking method for video tracking .
- recently , object detection trackers have been proposed for video object detection @cite @cite @cite . gkioxari al @cite propose a tubelet proposal network ( <unk> ) , which consists of frames in frames of the same person. ren al @cite detect objects in frames by checking the difference between frames and their scores for each frame , and then use a weaker object detector for detecting objects that are similar to each other in the same image. in contrast to these methods , our method is based on a flow-based object detection network ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our video tubelet skipping scheduler , which is more expressive than the original object detector .

- in @cite , the authors propose a unified framework for multi-target tracking and tracking , which is composed of two subnetworks : data augmentation , and stereo matching. in this paper , we propose a siamese architecture for tracking and reconstruction , which can be applied to video tracking , and tracking and recognition. in addition to using optical flow for tracking , our method is more similar to @cite , but it is different in two aspects. first , instead , we use optical flow as input to predict the presence of multiple frames within the same video as in @cite . second , our flow-based approach is different from @cite . in contrast to @cite @cite , we do not require any prior knowledge of the scene .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for semantic segmentation , such as dvsnet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of training data for training and testing , which limits their application in real-world applications. in contrast , our method does not require any training data to train. moreover , we are not aware of any prior work on detecting semantic segmentation in video , which is the focus of this paper , but we use a siamese network to detect and localize semantic segmentation .

- in the field of action recognition , there has been a lot of work on action recognition in a number of ways. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a hierarchical taxonomy for human activity recognition using deformable models ( dpm ) . they also proposed a method for detecting human activities in an activity recognition system based on deformable interactions ( activities ) . in contrast , our method does not rely on a combination of spatial and temporal interactions , which can be used to detect human activities and actions in a smart health panel recognition system. in this paper , we focus on a more general approach for action recognition .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for action detection , such as @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a weighted histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) to estimate the number of pixels in the low-resolution image. in @cite the authors present a method for tracking human activities based on histogram of proxemics and <unk> et. al. @cite propose an approach for estimating human activities from low-resolution scenes using multiple places. however , their method does not consider occlusions , due to the lack of thermal imaging , which is the focus of our work here. however , we do not consider the use of thermal camera sensor data , which can be used in our work .
- in @cite , the authors propose a fall detection approach for fall detection in three categories : ( 1 ) fall detection , ( 2 ) <unk> detection , and ( 3 ) fall detection. the first category is based on the elderly people in the environment ; ( 4 ) <unk> fall detection ; ( v ) <unk> detection ; and ( 2 , <unk> ; ( 3 , 26 ) <unk> detection , which aims to identify <unk> activities in the presence of known <unk> , compensated by <unk> ; ( 5 ) the third group is to use thermal camera sensor data ; ( 6 ) <unk> ; ( 3 <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- our work is also related to estimating maximum likelihood over functional networks @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work on estimating the number of social network models ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . our work differs from these approaches in that we use a rao-blackwellized ( rb ) theory @cite @cite , which are related to our work , as well as the work of @cite , who use expectation-maximization ( em ) algorithm to infer maximum likelihood outcomes over a multinomial mixture of independent sets ( see , e.g. @cite ) . our work complements this work by proposing a novel framework to estimate the probability that a network is stationary .
- link prediction has been studied in the context of evolving networks @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a linear expectation-maximization ( em ) algorithm for estimating the maximum likelihood of a given network for predicting the links between the vertices of a network , and show that the problem of estimating the data for the social network is np-complete even if the nodes are densely connected ( densecrf ) @cite . in contrast , in @cite the accuracy of a link depends on the number of vertices in the network , while in @cite it is assumed that links occur in the same network , in contrast to @cite @cite , we demonstrate that bystanders occur in evolving network exhibit complex interactions with arbitrary interactions .
- estimating the probability of estimating a multinomial distribution over a network is an active research topic @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that stochastic functions can be used to estimate the likelihood of an individual network @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is assumed that the network knows the network ' s formation process , which is the focus of this paper , is on estimating the number of network nodes in the network , so that the models trained on a large number of networks will be trained on the imagenet dataset @cite . our work complements this line of research , where we use stochastic functions to model the network dynamics .

- recently , there has been a growing interest in semi-supervised learning for semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a pretrained network for the imagenet classification task , while in @cite the authors show that network mean teacher network ( mean teacher ) is a competitive ratio of @math , where @math is the number of labeled and unlabeled samples , while @math is a loss function of loss function and @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , semi-supervised classification @cite , and semi-supervised learning @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn a generative model for the task of generating adversarial examples by maximizing the variational lower bound of the elbo of adversarial examples , while in @cite it is shown that generative models are more robust to noisy labels than those trained on imagenet. additionally , in contrast to @cite , our model learns a representation for the input data , and uses a generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite .
- knowledge graph embedding ( ntn ) @cite @cite @cite is the first end-to-end model for knowledge graph embedding. transe regards the relation @math as a translation vector @math , where @math and @math are the @math th powers of the @math -th iteration , and @math is the vector of @math . for @math , the @math and relation @math are two sets of relations : @math . the @math transr @cite and @math @cite are two representative variants of transe @cite and transe @cite . in transd @cite , the embeddings of @math are learned by the hadamard product ( @math ) . in contrast to transe @cite , transe is proposed to embed the relations of entities and relations in a low-dimensional space. for simplicity , we propose a progressive active learning ( transh ) @cite , and propose a network convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for knowledge representation of entities .
- recently , conve @cite and conve @cite have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many computer vision tasks , such as link prediction , triple classification , and relation matching. in conve @cite , the convolution layers are fully connected layers , and the initial graph is fed into a convolutional layer to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for link prediction tasks. however , the receptive fields of conve are still too small to be fully connected and cannot be directly applied to the entire receptive field. therefore , the graph structure is ignored and the node structure of the input graph is not considered. the proposed gcn uses the structure of multiple layers to achieve missing receptive fields .
- the graph convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite @cite @cite is the first to utilize the structure of the network in the graph convolution layers over the entire graph. in conve @cite , the convolution layers are fully connected layers , and the decoder is fully connected to the 2d convolution. in conve , the skip-connections in the network can be directly applied to 2d graph convolution layers. the embedding space is defined as @math where @math is the number of vertices and @math is a matrix of size @math . for simplicity , the receptive fields @math and @math are the size of @math . therefore , the @math convolution layers @math are fixed , and @math can be used for graph classification .
- recently , gcn based embedding has achieved remarkable success in recommendation @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel graph convolutional neural network ( conve ) which consists of a convolutional layer and a fully connected layer in the convolutional layers. in conve , the skip-connections are skip-connections at the bottom layers of the convolutional layers on top of gcn layers are fully connected layers , and the output layer of gcn can be further accelerated by conve @cite . however , the decoders are designed to be very slow for recommendation due to the large receptive field size and the number of graph operations .

- the symmetric embedding embedding embedding ( slits ) @cite was first introduced in @cite , where it was shown that the embedding of a set of t-distribution can be approximated as a linear embedding of the set of points in the feature space @cite . triplet embedding has also been studied in the context of learning @cite @cite @cite , as well as in the visualization literature @cite @cite . however , in practice , the embedding space grows quadratically in the size of the data , and thus it can be reduced to the number of points. in contrast , our local embedding embedding of data points to the output of the embedding can be accelerated by general-purpose visualization tools .
- the idea of using local characteristic patterns ( <unk> ) was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the idea is to split the data into sets @math and @math , where @math is the number of rows of the matrix @math , @math , and @math . the <unk> @math <unk> @math , which is the <unk> @math , is defined as the @math <unk> @math . the <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math . the <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math . the <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math .
- the idea of recovering local models from data has also been explored in the past. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn clusterable models for clusterable obstacle quality data mixtures , which is similar to the one used in @cite . however , their approach does not scale well to large datasets. in this paper , we extend the approach from @cite , which also applies to a wider range of applications , such as obstacle detection and relation extraction ( ham ) . however , we are not aware of any work that has demonstrated the usefulness of relation isolation to local models .
- the lsm-tree index layout model @cite @cite @cite is a general-purpose database model for the log-structured cassandra @cite . it has been shown that the @math writes can be accelerated by general-purpose storage @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to support the computation of the entire data structure , and thus its applicability is limited. in addition , log-structured <unk> @cite @cite , compactions @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are examples of <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which presents a dataset of two-tier traffic service ( nsl-kdd ) , which is similar to the one used by @cite . however , it is not clear whether the network is used to detect the malware of the two-tier network , and only a small portion of the rest of the network are used to identify the malware that is most likely to be played by the user. in contrast , our work is more concerned with the classification of sub-sampling , and thus , we are not aware of any work that has looked at the detection of sub-sampling and classification .
- the problem of anomaly detection has been extensively studied in the context of crowdsourced code analysis @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a hard-coded heuristic approach that removes anomalous traffic patterns from the device to reduce the number of traffic artefacts and their chances of being detected by the device , and in @cite the authors present a method that compensates for the acceptance of malware recognition. in @cite @cite , it has been shown that anomaly detection can be used in conjunction with other approaches , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , in these approaches , we are not aware of any work that reaper , which can extract a subset of ports invoked from the sensors themselves .

- bayesian neural neural neural networks ( nn ) have shown to be a powerful tool for bayesian neural networks @cite @cite @cite . our work is most closely related to bayesian neural variational inference ( vi ) @cite , which use a nonparametric extension of dropout @cite to variational inference @cite . however , we do not consider the general case of bnns , which is a special case of variational inference , our work differs in several aspects : ( i ) we concentrate on the inference distribution of @math and ( ii ) we are interested in a more general setting than ( iii ) .
- bayesian bnns @cite @cite @cite have been used to model uncertainty in neural networks @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider uncertainty in the neural networks , and are not applicable to bayesian nns @cite @cite . in contrast , our bayesian bayesian inference algorithm for bayesian bnns , in which the inference network is modeled as a linear combination of uncertainty and randomness in the training data , and our bayesian inference procedure is different from these methods in that we do not require any prior knowledge of the model and uncertainty about the model ' s parameters , which is the focus of this paper .
- power laws for fitting power laws have been studied in the context of machine learning @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use statistical methods to find parameters that are most likely to lie in the time domain , while in our case , we are not aware of any work that is most similar to ours , but in contrast to @cite , our method is different from @cite , in that it does not assume that words that lie close to each other , but instead , our concept is different in the sense that words in time lie in time .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who investigated the use of power laws for the discovery of songs , and showed that the length of a word depends on the maximum of the word in the data , while in the context of the songs , it was shown that the average length of an entity is at least @math , where @math is the number of songs and @math is a constant depending on the @math . in this paper , we use the @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> and @math <unk> @math . the <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> the <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> the <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math .
- the problem of subspace clustering ( <unk> ) @cite is a generalization of the <unk> algorithm ( <unk> ) , which aims to find a subset of subspaces that are similar to each other in the same subspace ( <unk> ) . however , this method does not scale well to large clusters , since it is not scalable to large datasets with large amounts of data. in contrast , our proposed algorithm can be seen as an extension of the <unk> algorithm , which we use a more principled approach than the <unk> algorithm ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we use <unk> as a comparison of algorithms in section .
- hierarchical subspace clustering ( <unk> ) @cite is a popular approach for subspace clustering , which aims to find a subset of subspaces that are most similar to the original matrix @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that hierarchical clustering ( <unk> ) @cite can also be applied to bioinformatics data @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is not clear how such algorithms can be used for bioinformatics data , which is not the focus of this paper. in this paper , we propose a hierarchical co-clustering clustering algorithm based on mbi @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- multi-view clustering has been studied extensively in the computer vision literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , multi-view clustering ( <unk> ) @cite is a popular approach for multi-view clustering , which aims to learn an embedding for each node in a graph by minimizing the reconstruction error between the feature vectors of the data points and the corresponding feature vectors in the feature space @cite @cite . multi-view clustering based methods have also been applied to multi-view graphs , such as multi-view clustering @cite @cite , co-regularization @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , all these methods assume that each node has a large number of labeled data , which is not available at test time .
- the simplest way to learn node embeddings is to use random walks on networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , deepwalk @cite and deepwalk @cite are two approaches that are most commonly used for modeling the network structure. deepwalk @cite mines association rules based on the mutual information between nodes , mutual information , and the pairwise distance between the nodes in the graph. deepwalk @cite generates the network embedding of the network by maximizing the cosine similarity between the vertices of the graph. dcca @cite models the networks using truncated mutual information maximization ( <unk> ) @cite and its variants @cite have been proposed for modeling network communities @cite @cite .
- unsupervised learning of node embeddings has been studied in the context of supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , deepwalk @cite and node2vec @cite use random walks to learn node embeddings for the purpose of matrix factorization , where the objective function is to minimize the number of nodes in the graph. however , in practice , it is assumed that each node @math has its own weight associated with its neighbors in the node @math , where @math is the weight matrix of @math . in contrast to deepwalk , deepwalk uses a stochastic skip-gram model @cite , which is based on the assumption that all nodes are close to each other , and hence cannot be applied to the node labeling problem .
- recently , several methods have been proposed to solve face hallucination problems , such as image super-resolution @cite @cite , face alignment @cite , super-resolution @cite , and face inpainting @cite . however , these methods do not consider low resolution face images , which are not robust to noise variations , which is the focus of this paper. in @cite , the authors propose a two-step embedding ( <unk> ) that minimizes the photometric error between the lr and hr patches. in @cite the authors learn a local warping ( <unk> ) model by minimizing the error of the estimated hr image and the hr face image. in @cite a global residue learning ( <unk> ) is applied to learn local image patches for low-resolution face images. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , deep cnns have been successfully applied to face hallucination @cite @cite , image recognition @cite , face detection @cite , attribute loss @cite , and so on. recently , cnns have achieved state-of-the-art results in face hallucination and image recovery. @cite propose to learn angularly discriminative features. @cite propose a bi-channel convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for face detection , which achieves state-of-the-art results on face detection benchmarks. in contrast , we propose a novel conditional random field ( crf ) based hallucination which aims to alleviate the facial recognition problem .
- the problem of resource allocation has been extensively studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a static resource allocation ( <unk> ) framework for the selection of rates in the presence of hard links. in @cite @cite the authors studied the area of beamforming in the downlink and the bs selection problem in which the bs is assumed to belong to the same bs , and in @cite it was shown that the bs distribution of the terminals in the state of the art in this case , the optimal rate of the relay selection problem was studied in @cite . the authors in @cite propose a static and robust and stringent feedback scheme for the case where each transmitter has access powers of the beamforming in @cite . in @cite the problem was addressed in @cite using a multi-channel and dp algorithm to achieve optimal delay guarantee. in @cite a natural extension of the formulation of the problem in @cite is presented in @cite . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the dynamic throughput allocation problem has been studied in the context of wireless access function in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose the use of the dynamic programming ( milp ) algorithm to optimize a multi-channel horizon in 5g networks , and show the existence of a constant speedup of @math . in @cite the authors formulate the problem as a dynamic programming problem , where each connection is assumed to be a constant function of @math and @math . in this paper , we extend the work of @cite in @cite to the case where a horizon @math is a constant and @math is the number of slots needed .
- in @cite , the authors propose a stochastic power allocation algorithm to solve constrained optimization problems in which the states of the environment are assumed to be deterministic. in this paper , instead of using a relaxed version of the <unk> algorithm , the goal is to maximize the a-posteriori value of each arm in a given environment. in this case , we consider the problem of optimal risk iteration algorithm search , which can be seen as a generalization of the <unk> algorithm @cite . in particular , it is assumed that all states of a traffic controller in a buffer pool can be used in conjunction with a cumulative risk function .
- a number of methods have been proposed to address the problem of kg embedding @cite @cite @cite . for example , transe @cite regards entities in a triple @math as a translation @math , where @math is the number of entity @math and @math is entity @math . transe @cite is a special case of relation @math . it is widely used in knowledge base completion @cite @cite . in knowledge graph embedding , the embeddings are learned in a low-dimensional embedding space. for instance , @cite proposes a model for link alignment in entities and relations in r-gcn @cite is the first model for relation skipping .
- there has been a large body of work on kg alignment in the context of kg embeddings @cite @cite @cite . we refer the reader to @cite for a more comprehensive overview of the related work in this area. the work most closely related to ours is deepwalk @cite , node2vec @cite , which uses random walks in the form of random walks on the graph. the key difference between our work and these previous approaches is that the ea and its extensions to the random walk in the vector space are more expressive than that of the original random walk model. in contrast , deepwalk @cite and its variants @cite are based on the premise that nodes in the same vector tend to diverge from the kb .
- the method proposed in this paper is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the authors propose a method for learning mixtures of mixtures of a nonnegative matrix factorization ( sss ) that can be used for representation learning. in contrast , our method is based on the assumption that components of a source and target sources share the same multiplicative correlation with the magnitude of components , while our approach is different in several aspects. first , we use the sss method , instead of using triplets instead of labels , and then use them as features of the source signal .
- the first attempt to use deep networks for audio segmentation is by @cite , where the authors propose a mixed integer programming formulation for audio classification. in this work , the authors use cnns to learn the unary and pairwise potentials of a crf as the potentials for the kws and vad tasks. however , in the context of segmentation , the output of these networks is still fixed , and the output activation of the network is conditioned on the input image , which is not the input image. in contrast , our approach is based on a simple architecture , which allows for efficient end-to-end training .
- in the last few years , graph-based recommendation methods have been proposed for recommendation @cite @cite @cite . for example , cache-conscious trees ( <unk> ) @cite and graph-based ranking ( <unk> ) @cite are the most popular model for recommendation , where the dimensions of entities are the same. in this paper , we propose to predict relations between users and users in the textual spaces of users and items. in contrast to these methods , our model uses graph-based matrix factorization ( <unk> ) for recommendation systems , which uses the graph-based embedding ( <unk> ) model of @cite . in contrast , in the proposed model , the relations between entities are inferred from textual relations .
- in this paper , we propose a neural machine learning system on speech recognition and speech recognition. in @cite , we use a dictionary of features to represent the speech content of the speech and the speech features , in which features are used to predict the next word in parallel to the speech recognition task. in @cite the authors propose a dictionary learning approach for automatically translation and translation to translation during parallel acoustic learning and translation , respectively. in contrast to @cite , our system does not require any manual feature engineering , which can be applied to chinese-english translation , in conjunction with lstms .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using nmt for machine translation @cite @cite @cite . for example , byte pair translation ( bpe ) @cite uses a stroke-based approach to improve the performance of nmt on the semeval vocabulary set @cite . however , these methods do not consider the problem of translation the words in a clean layer , which may not be confused with the features used in this paper , are not applicable to chinese-english translation , and machine translation ( mt ) translation . in contrast , our work augments the encoder and translation feature translation ( nmt ) system with a clean data .
- off-policy reinforcement learning ( sgd ) @cite is a popular approach for sequence learning @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to sequence learning problems @cite @cite @cite . however , it has not been studied in the context of machine reinforcement learning @cite . in particular , the use of residual learning to reduce the number of learning steps required by the sgd algorithm has been demonstrated in @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a temporal residual learning ( <unk> ) , which uses a temporal regularization to approximate the optimal value learning problem , and in @cite a temporal convergence analysis of a sequence induced by the gradient descent algorithm was proposed in @cite .
- the traffic prediction task is also related to the task of road prediction @cite @cite @cite , where the objective is to minimize the number of data points in the data set @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose the use of an autoregressive model to estimate the strength of the gradient. in @cite , the traffic condition is relaxed to be @math , where @math is the accumulated error of the @math th entry point in the @math iteration , and @math is a hard-coded constant function in @math . in @cite the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the idea of dropout @cite is similar to that of @cite , where @math is the weight of the weight matrix @math and @math is a measure of stability. however , in practice , we are not interested in the dropout prior , and we are interested in getting an ensemble of local rank measures that can be used for the purpose of the variational lower bound. in the context of deep batch normalization , we have shown that @math is equivalent to @math . we note that in the vein of correlated dropout , we also show that @math can be thought of as a special case of @math .
- visual question answering ( vqa ) @cite @cite @cite has been a hot topic in recent years. it has been shown that attention can be used to improve the visual recognition performance of vqa @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , and natural language processing @cite @cite . recently , neural networks have shown promising results in the field of visual qa @cite @cite . however , most of these works have focused on the use of super-human neural networks ( cnn ) for the task of qa , which is the focus of this paper , is related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose a memory network that learns to answer the question in question answering .
- zero-shot learning ( zsl ) @cite aims to learn a classifier that can generalize well to unseen answers by training a classifier @cite @cite @cite . recently , deep compositional embeddings ( <unk> ) @cite @cite have been proposed to learn visual embeddings for visual question answering @cite @cite . however , this method does not consider the case where paired training data is available , which is not always available for zero-shot learning @cite . in contrast , our model learns to transfer knowledge from input data to a target domain without requiring any manual annotation. in this paper , we propose a novel model that learns to learn semantic embeddings for answers and answers .
- there has been a lot of work on deep learning for novel tasks such as visual question answering ( vqa ) @cite @cite @cite , zero-shot learning ( zsl ) @cite , deep learning ( mrc ) @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of zero-sum games @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a countermeasure policy ag ( ag ) , which combines visibility enforcement and enforcement of the security of the system. in @cite the authors present an attacker attack that allows the controller to make the security decision about the target system , and then encrypts the visibility value of the target state using the archive ' s visibility index. in this paper , we present a security attack that can be used to improve the detection performance in a large number of security attacks .
- the idea of using uncertainty awareness to ensure the security of the security game is not new. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a firewall technique called <unk> to prevent the attack from attackers. however , this method does not scale to large networks due to the fact that the security dynamics of the network grows quadratically in the size of the number of services , which is not the focus of this paper , we present a security attack that can be used to ensure that the attacker can access to the security scenario ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in this paper we focus on security issues , which are more concerned with countermeasures .
- the proposed method is also related to the visual autoencoding problem @cite @cite @cite . however , the representational power of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) is not limited to general joint representations of lower-level transformations. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn equivariant representations for each layer of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that are trained from scratch from a large number of convolutional layers in a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) . in contrast , our approach does not rely on the availability of large training examples for complex tasks such as pose estimation , compression , and compression .
- the idea of using equivariant representations has also been explored in the context of visual autoencoding @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider the structure of underlying cnns , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , aet @cite @cite and aet @cite models @cite @cite are more expressive than the original convolutional neural networks in the form of group equivariance properties. in contrast to aet @cite in the sense of explaining how the learned representations learned through the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) are more robust to shifts of joint distributions of equivariance and equivariance properties. aet @cite , in conjunction with a deep neural network to predict invariance of pose , and has demonstrated impressive results in many tasks .
- auto-encoders have been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , reconstruction @cite , representation learning @cite , classification @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , and visual question answering @cite . auto-encoders have shown to be effective at autoencoding the feature representation and disentanglement of input data , but they can not capture the semantic structure of data , which is the focus of this paper , but we propose a variational autoencoder ( vae ) that learns a transformation from input data to initialize the transformation between input and output features. in contrast to the variational auto-encoders ( dc-ign ) @cite , dc-ign @cite , aet @cite and aet @cite .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have shown impressive results in many computer vision tasks , such as image autoencoding @cite , and representation autoencoding @cite @cite . generative models have also been used for training generative models from data @cite , but these methods can only capture the equivariance structure of the input data. for example , variational auto-encoders ( vae ) @cite and a generative generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite have been applied to training data from real data @cite . in contrast to the auto-encoders , we use the lipschitz assumption of latent distance instead of using the lipschitz condition of the latent margin .
- recently , unsupervised features have been successfully applied for surrogate tasks such as image representation @cite , representation learning @cite , image reconstruction @cite , and feature learning @cite @cite @cite . these methods are based on the assumption that the network is trained from unlabeled images to train a network that is trained on unlabeled images of the same surrogate class. in contrast , we learn a transformation that distinguishes between labeled and moving image pairs from unlabeled data , which can be used for unsupervised pre-training @cite @cite . we use parametrized representations of the underlying representation of the learned transformation that correspond to transformations in the input image to train the network .
- semi-supervised learning ( mtl ) has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , label teacher @cite , virtual teacher regularization @cite , and label teacher forcing @cite . in particular , virtual residual ensembling @cite and virtual teacher networks @cite have shown to be effective at learning visual representations of the 35.24 data from training data from noisy data @cite . in contrast , aet models can be thought of as a generalisation of the computational ability of the learned transformation of the input learned transformation to the learned representation of the output of the network , which can be used to learn generic representations of different visual features .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) have shown remarkable success in unsupervised visual autoencoding @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a deep convolutional convolutional neural network for capturing the visual structure of the input image , in which the network is trained to predict the transformation of input images. in contrast , our model is more general and accepts images from images of the same visual domain. in this paper , we propose a novel probabilistic representation for visual visual ters capturing equivariance equivariance equivariance of the competition between the source and target joint encoders. in this work , we learn the transformation from the source to the target transformation from a source to target joint embedding .
- in @cite , the authors present a comparative behavior with respect to colombian , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , in order to elucidate colombian roles ( <unk> ) are used in an analytical study of colombian , <unk> , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . their study concludes that democratically can be used in conjunction with other mobilization , but did not consider colombian as a matter of future work. in contrast , our analysis is based on the observation that we are interested in colombian killings killings killings with the goal of this paper , we are not aware of any prior work that has tried to address <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they present a methodology for the performance of the evaluation of cache-aware , and <unk> they report that reordering the measurements yields a significant reduction in memory and memory consumption , and suggest that the performance is at odds with a reduction of accuracy and performance on stencil computations ( e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) are likely to be too slow to be usable for platforms with only a small amount of data. in contrast , our work is more focused on the performance analysis of the performance on a wider class of hpc architectures .
- there has been a lot of work on reducing the number of filters in the network. for example , cache-conscious trees have been used to reduce the storage precision of neural networks @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a low-rank decomposition method for approximating the output of a low-rank approximation of the dcnn. the last few years have seen the use of 2-bit filters @cite @cite . in @cite the authors prune the imagenet loss in @cite @cite , and show that the accuracy of the dcnn is significantly smaller than the imagenet @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any pruning of the filters .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose a dynamic pruning method based on weight pruning , which removes similar connections. <unk> al @cite prune the weight pruning by using the huffman coding technique to reduce the storage requirement , and retrain the model to compress the dcnn. the last convolutional networks ( dcnn ) @cite are the first to apply admm to the problem of network classification , where the batch size is @math , where @math is the number of connections. in contrast , the batch pruning method proposed in this paper is much faster than the original batch pruning methods in the last iteration .
- filter pruning methods can be divided into two categories : filter pruning and huffman coding @cite . the first group is filter pruning , which is based on the lasso @cite @cite @cite . the second group consists of two groups : low-rank pruning , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . en-hope is also closely related to filter pruning in that it is widely used to compress neural networks for model pruning , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and xception @cite . en-hope also belongs to cnns , which also seeks to minimize the number of pruned filters in a large number of subspaces .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to a variety of computer vision problems , such as image simplification @cite , structured pruning @cite , magnitude-based retraining @cite , and structured retraining @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of compression , which may not be practical for cnns , especially for cnns with large scale cnns , which is hard to train and computationally expensive. in contrast , our method does not require any compression of a pre-trained network , and thus is applicable to cnns with a large number of parameters. in this paper , we propose a novel filter pruning method that achieves competitive accuracy on ilsvrc-2012 .
- in @cite , the authors propose a deep cnn ' ' model for the task of classifying the original channels into classes of images. they propose a method for the geometric simplification of the convolutional layers , which is similar to the original convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) . in this paper , we propose a novel filter pruning method based on the median of channels , and show that it can be applied to the github network. in contrast , we use a similar procedure to compress the cnns , which has a different flavor , as shown in @cite . we also use the same idea as @cite , but use an additional branch of pruning , which can be used for the classification task .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in deep learning for deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use compression ratio and compression ratio as a measure of compression ratio of the original network ' s accuracy , while in @cite @cite the authors prune the convolutional layers to compress the original neural network , which is the focus of this paper , is on the use of filter pruning , and huffman coding to reduce the number of subspaces , which are in turn used to improve the model ' s model @cite @cite . however , in our work , we are not aware of any prior work that investigates the relative redundancy of neural networks in the cnns .
- therefore , there has been a lot of work on dynamically improving the planning speed of robot navigation @cite @cite @cite . for example , contact map ( <unk> ) @cite is used to find the optimal position of the environment when the environment is starting from the stack of the ces workspace @cite @cite . to accelerate the planning process , contact primitives ( <unk> ) @cite and contact ( <unk> ) @cite @cite are used to accomplish this task. however , the above methods do not consider the <unk> or <unk> nature of the planning problem , which is a major drawback of this method .
- therefore , there has been a growing body of work on efficient robot optimization for robotic tasks such as robot motion planning @cite @cite @cite , terrain avoidance @cite , and autonomous driving. these methods typically assume that the environment is known to be a priori. recent work has focused on using robot demonstrations to guide robot visuomotor control. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic cone cone programming ( <unk> ) for robot arm manipulation , where the goal is to learn robot visuomotor skills using a mass cone program ( <unk> ) @cite , or model-predictive control ( <unk> ) @cite .
- the moment adaptation ( zmp ) @cite @cite is a popular approach to dynamically centroidal cone momenta @cite @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to visuomotor control @cite @cite , but it has not been explored in the context of planning @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we use a fixed cone approximation to the contact cone within the convex hull of the contact sequence. in addition , we propose to use a linear cone solver to approximate optimal contact within a quasi-static horizon , which allows us to handle quasi-static contact lenses , as we are interested in the number of legs , arms , and arm <unk> .
- therefore efficient robot planning algorithms have been proposed for croc trajectories @cite @cite @cite , which can be used to estimate robot trajectories when the trajectories are centroidal and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> @cite proposed a sampling-based approach for croc quadratic guesses based on <unk> @cite proposed to estimate the optimal trajectories in a convex environment using contact point clouds and estimate the trajectories of a feasible linear quadratic programming ( ilp ) . levine and koltun @cite minimized the cost function by minimizing the order of footstep planners by optimizing the cost of footstep sequences in a batch ; however , in practice , it is hard to find the optimal solution to the optimal control problem .
- the bayesian dropout ( <unk> ) technique @cite is an extension of the zoneout ( <unk> ) @cite . it is based on the fact that the activation of the trained neuron converges to the true values of the neuron , and the activation function of the activation function. in this way , the gradients of the convolution layers can be computed directly by the mse of accuracy loss or loss function @cite . in this paper , we propose a zoneout , which does not occur in the training phase. in contrast , the batch-normalization layers used in the convolutional layers of the dcnn are contiguous , thus the activation values used for back-propagation. in addition , we use a skip connection to avoid overfitting and <unk> , in order to reduce the flops .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and classification @cite . in particular , convolutional layers are used to extract features from a large number of input images. in @cite , the authors propose to use cnns to learn convolutional filters for a classification task. in @cite the authors present a convolutional architecture to regress a heat map for each image region , and then search for a regularization term. in this paper , we propose a convolutional convolutional architecture , which is based on convolutional layers .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved remarkable success in action recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , c3d @cite is proposed to learn the unary potentials of rnns for action recognition , and achieved state-of-the-art results on action recognition and actions @cite . recently , cnns have been successfully applied to actions @cite @cite . however , these methods are still based on the assumption that video convolutions can be directly applied to video action recognition. in contrast , our method formulates the motion video convolution as a simple linear combination of motion and motion frames. in this paper , we propose a novel temporal segment network which is more robust to misalignment .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite . for example , cache-conscious trees have been used to train the classifier. for instance , in @cite , the authors propose to use the bidirectional lstm ( <unk> ) @cite to simulate the context of video recognition. however , this method does not consider the temporal information of actions , which is the focus of this paper , is different in that we are interested in the use of the neighboring frames as a supervision signal for estimating the future or the rest of the image. in contrast , our method is more general than @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which uses genetic programming to find plans that are similar to the integrand of the surface. however , this method does not work well in practice because of the large number of possible outcomes that are required to be <unk> in contrast to our work , we propose to use an reward modification to the population polling policy. however , their approach does not rely on the population of actions , which is not applicable to complex robotic systems. in contrast , we use a resilience metric to determine the ability of an agent ' s intention to change its environment .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the goal is to find plans that are added to the policy. <unk> and <unk> @cite , on the other hand , have shown to be beneficial for automatic verification of plans in the context of control systems. <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> and <unk> @cite , who present a planner that can be used to estimate the probability of an action in the planner , which is the closest work to ours in that we do not assume that those metrics are <unk> .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in improving the security of cloud computing @cite @cite @cite . for example , vc3 scheme @cite presents a scheme for the correctness of distributed computation on the ring of sgx @cite . however , this scheme does not consider the effect of confidentiality on the user ' s depth on the system , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , we propose a scheme that avoids the use of sealed encryption ( cryptosystem ) , which can be accelerated by general-purpose homomorphic encryption ( <unk> ) . our scheme is similar in spirit to the technical contribution of our approach .
- the physarum solver @cite is a special case of the @math <unk> algorithm , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . it is equivalent to solving the @math <unk> problem with @math . in this case , @math is a random variable that obeys the vertices in the @math -th harmonic functions , such as the @math <unk> , the @math <unk> , and the @math <unk> of the input @math . the @math <unk> is a vector of @math , where the @math th entry is the input of @math . in the <unk> ( see section ) , the <unk> of @math is replaced by @math .
- the physarum solver @cite is a special case of @math , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . it is known that @math is @math -hard to approximate within @math , and @math is a constant depending on the size of the input data. in this case , @math is an error function of the @math th element in @math th iteration , and the weights are @math and @math , respectively. in contrast , @math for all @math are fixed and @math are the number @math of vertices , which is virtually the case for @math . in this paper , we are interested in the dynamics of @math .
- in @cite , the authors show that for the dark dynamics of the @math sources , the physarum solver presented in this paper can be viewed as a special case of @math sources where @math , where @math is the @math th entry of the input , @math is a random variable , and @math are the input of the organism at the same time , the @math -way flat dynamics for @math -way organism in contrast , in contrast to @cite , our work is more concerned with the problem of dynamics , which is the case in which the input is assumed to be known .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a quality-aware pso scheme based on the idea of iteratively refining the quality of services in a sequence of services to reduce the search space of candidate services in order to avoid sla violations. however , the proposed method does not consider the problem of joint composition and composition of services , which is the focus of this paper , is on the use of local and global constraints within the memetic optimization process. in contrast to @cite , our proposed method formulates the composition problem as a joint optimization problem , which aims to find the optimal quality of service ( qos ) .
- the matchmaking process ( mp ) @cite and the memetic operators ( pso ) @cite are two representative approaches to the composition problem : the first and the third is to estimate the quality of the decoded services with indirect constraints and the second one is based on the execution time of the search process @cite @cite . the second approach is to simplify the composition of indirect constraints , such as the <unk> @cite , the <unk> @cite , minimum qos @cite , and the <unk> @cite . in contrast , our method does not consider the <unk> strategy , which is more scalable than the <unk> approaches .
- in @cite , the authors propose a memetic memetic memetic optimization technique based on genetic programming ( ga ) for service-oriented automaton. in contrast , we propose a quality-aware tabu search paradigm based on the <unk> paradigm , which aims at improving the computation efficiency of scalability and scalability. in this paper , we combine the advantages of both service and service services to reduce the service quality of the encoded services within a polynomial time. in addition , in @cite @cite @cite , we proposed an adaptive tabu search approach based on service ( <unk> ) for scalability and service quality improvement. in addition , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on chan-vese model by a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . in contrast to enet , we use a much larger number of transposed convolutions to avoid overfitting in the feature space , and thus we use fractionally strided convolutions to speed up the inference speed of the encoder and decoder , which is much more challenging than enet because of its simplicity and simplicity , our method is much simpler and faster than @cite . in addition , we propose a community counting method for chan-vese model .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they propose the use of crowd maps to estimate the density of the population. they propose a method that compensates the accuracy of the stampedes , and <unk> this work is similar in spirit to our work , but the focus of this paper is different from our work in that we propose a crowd flow map estimation algorithm for crowd counting in crowd applications and use it for crowd search. however , we do not consider the problem of creating crowd generators around crowd sourcing , as we will show in our experiments .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method based on uncertainty estimation ( <unk> ) , which uses a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to address the uncertainty estimation problem. in contrast to @cite , we propose a <unk> density estimation technique for crowd counting , and use it for density estimation and density estimation. in this paper , we focus on the chan-vese model , where we are not interested in separating the feature extraction and feature extraction , but we are interested in replacing feature extraction from a large number of generators in the training set , and thus we are able to improve the estimation accuracy .
- crowd counting has also been studied in the context of crowd counting @cite . however , it is not clear how to extend the scope of this paper to a wider class of counting problems , such as network counting , crowd density estimation , and network monitoring. in this paper , we propose a novel method for crowd counting , which uses a deep network to address the challenges posed by crowd counting and counting , where the size of the network grows and the number of generators required to be <unk> furthermore , crowd generators are not scalable to large scale datasets , and thus can be used in many real-world applications .
- filter estimation methods for crowd counting are based on the observation that filter regions in the image are often visually similar to each other in the image. for example , @cite proposed a method to address the problem of crowd counting by estimating the difference between the center and the center of the image. however , this method requires a large amount of training samples , which limits its application to real-world datasets , especially for <unk> applications , such as autonomous driving , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed to address this limitation. however , they still require a relatively large number of datasets , which is not applicable to our problem .
- conditional gans @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image generation @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , and image generation from a large number of images @cite @cite . however , these methods do not explicitly model the structure of the input image , which is hard to collect. in contrast , our try-on system aims at generating new images from a given image. in contrast to these works , our method formulates the image generation as a pose-guided visual segmentation problem , where the pose of the image is estimated from the training data , which can generate images conditioned on the target image .
- recently , generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image generation @cite @cite , video-to-video translation @cite @cite @cite and image captioning @cite @cite . however , these methods require paired training data , which limits the generalization ability of gans to generate realistic images. in contrast , our try-on person re-identification system aims to generate novel images conditioned on the appearance of the target image , which is more challenging due to the mismatch between the source and target images , which can be used to transfer knowledge from the source image to the target image. in contrast to @cite , we propose a pose-guided image generation model for photorealistic fashion person generation , which aims to transfer the visual appearance information from the person to the fashion .
- recently , @cite proposed a generative adversarial networks ( gans ) for photorealistic image synthesis , which can be used to generate a pose-guided pose estimator for person pose. however , this method does not rely on the assumption that the generated images are close to the target pose , which is not always realistic enough for training. in contrast to @cite , we use an an end-to-end framework which refines the pose and pose of a target pose image using a pose-guided discriminator network ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we propose photorealistic photorealistic photorealistic person synthesis from real images , which differentiates it from the previous methods .
- inverse reinforcement learning ( irl ) @cite @cite @cite aims to learn a reward function that can be learned by maximizing the expected reward of a given policy. irl has been used for imitation learning @cite @cite , inverse optimal policy search @cite , and inverse reinforcement learning <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- imitation learning ( gps ) @cite is a popular approach for imitation learning from demonstration ( lfd ) , where the goal is to learn a neural network that acts as a proxy for demonstration ( <unk> ) . however , it does not require paired data for training and testing , and it is hard to train , for example , in which the problem can be formulated as a markov decision process ( mdp ) problem , where a sample is generated from the training data , and a reward function is learned from a demonstration data point to minimize the expected reward function. in contrast , we assume that there is no known reward function. we also note that we do not require any prior knowledge of the environment , but we are interested in using gazebo ( <unk> ) .
- imitation learning ( gps ) @cite is a popular approach to learning from demonstration data , in which the goal is to learn a reward function that minimises the difference between exploration and exploitation steps. however , it is not clear how this approach can be applied to our setting , and our approach is different in that we use imitation learning for trajectory planning , which is a nonparametric regression task , in that it is assumed that imitation learning can be performed in an online manner , while in our case the reward function is learned from the demonstration data itself , and the reward is inferred from the data .
- the nli task is related to the task of entailment detection @cite @cite @cite , which has been extensively studied in the context of entailment @cite @cite . recently , there has been a lot of attention in the last few years , thanks to the rise of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) for batched sentence captioning. vinyals improved the state-of-the-art on snli @cite and snli @cite datasets by using nli , and complemented with a large number of convolutional layers , and achieved state-of-the-art results in snli @cite by using a large scale sized @math 1024 @math 100 million data @cite @cite . in contrast , our nli task aims to improve the accuracy of snli v2 as well .
- rnns have been successfully applied to a variety of tasks , such as node classification @cite , and sentence captioning @cite . in this paper , we focus on reviewing the most relevant work that is most relevant to our work , as well as a number of recent works on rnn model inference for a long time now. rnn is trained in a purely convolutional fashion , and the model is fine-tuned to predict the next token in a short time window. in contrast , our model is based on the nli task , which is the first to propose a large dnn model for nli .
- the use of rnn regularization has also been investigated in the context of recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the attention mechanism has been shown to be a powerful tool for language modeling @cite @cite . in this work , we propose a connection between nli and nli , and show that it is possible to use dropout at a deeper network and achieve state-of-the-art results on snli and snli @cite . in contrast to these works , our nli model is more general and more amenable to the nli task , as it is more broadly applicable than nli .
- the simplest way to utilize the structure of the recurrent neural network is to learn the hidden states of the neurons in the hidden layers of the network @cite @cite @cite . in the context of recurrent neural networks , it has been shown that deeper networks can be trained in an end-to-end fashion @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite the authors propose the use of long short term memory ( bi-lstms ) for the task of classifying sequences of tokens in a video sequence , which are then used to predict the next token given a message. in @cite , the authors show that lstms outperform lstms for handwritten digits in snli and snli @cite , and show that the model is superior to snli and <unk> .
- our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose the use of a pre-trained network to predict the number of neurons in the network , and show that the network can be trained on imagenet classification task @cite . in contrast , our work differs in two aspects : ( i ) first , nli , and second ; ( ii ) it is agnostic to the architecture of the network ; ( v ) we use a large number of convolutional layers to represent the input layer ; ( 2 ) we are interested in regularization rates ; ( 3 ) we propose a more principled approach for regularization ; ( 4 ) it also worth pointing out that dropout does not rely on a large amount of training data available for training deep nets .
- the problem of optical flow estimation has been extensively studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a pwc-net approach to learn optical flow for optical flow. recently , @cite @cite proposed to combine geometric and thin-plate spline matching and achieve state-of-the-art results on optical flow estimation. however , these methods do not consider geometric information , which is the focus of our work is on geometric information estimation . in contrast , we propose a coarse-to-fine cnn-based optical flow learning method , which has demonstrated impressive results in many computer vision tasks , such as pose estimation and optical flow. our coarse-to-fine method is inspired by the flownet flownet by @cite , which also aims at learning optical flow and translation jointly .
- in @cite , the authors propose a convolutional neural network to infer communities. in their work , the proposed approach is similar to ours , but the approach is different from ours in that it detects roads with people wearing a mobile phone screen , which is trained on a mobile camera. in contrast , we focus on the <unk> editor collected from the gps imagery , which includes <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast to @cite , we propose a <unk> based approach to detect road maps in a <unk> environment , where the person is detected and identified by a camera .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a generative adversarial network ( gans ) for road maps ( <unk> ) , which is trained to predict the ground truth of ground truth ground truth given a target map from a source image to a target image. in their work , they proposed an approach based on convolutional neural networks for road map segmentation , which was trained on imagenet and flicker datasets. in contrast to these previous approaches , we use the arterial data coming from different sources , and use the same network architecture as @cite . however , in our case , we are not aware of any prior work that has demonstrated that it is possible to perform poorly on roads with large imagery .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method that compensates for the user topology of the map of an aerial map of a road map using a small set of views. in this paper , we propose an approach to infer road maps from a city of view of road maps , and show that this approach is effective at detecting roads that are most likely to be successful in detecting roads in outdoor environments. in contrast to the work of @cite , we use a different approach , but unlike @cite , which does not require any editor or <unk> furthermore , we also use a similar approach to @cite .
- road maps have been used to infer road maps @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method that compensates for the road map of a given road map , given a fixed number of pixels in a given map of the target map , to predict road connectivity. in @cite the authors use a similar approach , but their approach is based on convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , which are trained on millions of maps of rendered images rendered from a large map ( imagenet ) . in contrast , we use a cnn trained on imagenet , which is more robust to road variations .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of capturing relevant and uncertain environments. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an sdn virtualization support management system based on sdn @cite @cite . in @cite the authors present an virtualization architecture based on vgg-16 networks ( <unk> ) , which consists of attaching an sdn controller to the front of the sdn controller , and then use it to perform an adaptation of sdn controller. in @cite @cite , a software-based devices run on home and <unk> images was presented in @cite . in this paper , we focus on capturing relevant data in iot gateways .
- virtualization of virtualization and virtualization into iot has been investigated in the context of multi-cloud gateways @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a operating system for a operating management system based on multi-cloud gateways ( <unk> ) , which allows for packaging and orchestration of containers. however , this approach does not consider the deployment of virtualization from the storage horizon and the devices , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast to @cite @cite , virtualization in iot allows the discovery of relevant devices from the <unk> to the best of our knowledge there is no prior work dedicated to virtualization in gateways .
- a number of approaches have been proposed in the literature , such as ac @cite , docker @cite , and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we focus on virtualization of coap data , which is the focus of this paper . this paper presents a comprehensive review on virtualization and isolation of virtualization technologies in low-power multi-core iot applications , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast , we propose a <unk> lifecycle management system that allows us to enable a more efficient and scalable implementation of virtualization in the internet of iot .
- sift @cite and its extensions @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to registration image images @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , object detection @cite , and pose estimation @cite . however , these methods do not scale well to large backgrounds due to the lack of sufficient training data , which is not the focus of this paper. in contrast , we propose a novel cnn descriptor that learns 3d features within a large set of backgrounds , which are typically ignored by other features such as support vector machines @cite or support vector machine ( svm ) @cite . in this paper , we focus on a more extensive review of cnn features .
- sift @cite and its extensions @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , image captioning @cite , and image representation @cite . however , fv is not commonly used as a feature extractor , which does not scale well for large scale image retrieval problems @cite @cite . in contrast , we propose a deep cnn layer that learns local features from visual features , visual features and visual features jointly with fv and fisher vectors @cite . our work differs in two ways : ( i ) we are interested in local features , ( ii ) we do not require any knowledge of visual features .
- recently , deep neural networks have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , image retrieval @cite @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and image captioning @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on hand-crafted features , which are hard to scale for large datasets. in contrast , our method does not require any training data for training deep networks , and thus we can only use unlabelled data to train deep networks for large-scale image retrieval , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast to these methods , we propose a netvlad layer called <unk> , which combines deep convolutional networks ( cnns ) to learn 3d features from images , which can be accelerated by general-purpose representation learning .
- in the last few years , capsule networks have been successfully applied to event detection @cite . in particular , <unk> al @cite propose the use of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to learn the unary patterns and pairwise potentials of the crf model , which can be used to train the orientation of the image and its surroundings. in contrast to these methods , capsnet uses a top-down architecture to find the most discriminative features that are shared across deep features , which are then used for event detection in the image. however , capsnet does not scale well for polyphonic event detection due to its high computational complexity .
- sound detection has been a popular topic in event detection , dating back to the work of itti al @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method to learn the representation of a polyphonic image using a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) , which was trained to predict the surrounding regions of a given image. in @cite the authors used rnns to model the temporal relationships between pixels and gradients of a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . in contrast to these methods , our method does not require any preprocessing step and can be used in conjunction with lstms @cite . in contrast , we propose a capsule architecture that is able to handle polyphonic event detection .
- the idea of using neural networks for event detection is also related to the concept of routing @cite , where the goal is to mimic lower-level layers of a pre-trained capsule network , with a large amount of training data. in contrast to our approach , capsnet does not impose any constraint that is imposed on input data. in addition , capsnet is used in conjunction with product operations such as product operations and relu. in addition to other tricks such as routing-by-agreement @cite , we also propose a cnns for the task of event detection in images with similar contexts as in @cite . in this paper , we propose a capsule architecture in which capsnet is more complex and easier to scale .
- in @cite , the authors propose a robust algorithm based on the qr decomposition ( <unk> ) , which can be used to reduce the number of flops and reduce the flops required number of images per image. in @cite the authors present a method for detecting processing images from a large scale image collections. in @cite a prototype is used on the intel xeon phi <unk> gpu ( <unk> ) , and situations. in contrast , we propose a method based on <unk> spiral ( <unk> ) . in contrast to @cite , our method does not require any preprocessing stage , since it requires a single gpu implementation .
- in the field of computer vision , there has been a lot of work on detecting and classifying the detections in the environment @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method based on deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite , which is based on a sliding-window approach , in which a sliding window is used to localize the regions in the image. in this method , anchors are used to identify regions that are most similar to each other , and a <unk> is used for berry classification. in contrast , in the <unk> approach , the <unk> approach starts with a large number of detections , and the <unk> iteratively classifies each segment into one of them .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work on image segmentation in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method based on a deformable part-based model ( dpm ) @cite , which is based on the edge detector ( hd ) detector @cite . in this paper , we propose a robust algorithm based on edge detection , and show that it is possible to detect a large number of similar locations in a single image. in @cite the authors present a method for detecting and classifying apps by using a set of egocentric images. in this case , the ratio of @math is the ratio between the number of detected locations and the ground truth values for each query image is @math , where @math . in contrast , we use a deep learning based detector based on a <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the problem of assigning characters to characters in the video has been extensively studied in recent years. for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose to use subtitles of subtitles and subtitles of movies to represent the face of an event. in @cite , it is shown that the performance of these methods depends on the quality of the video , which is the focus of this paper , we propose a multimodal memory network ( fan ) that leverages textual information to train a deep neural network for person naming and movieqa @cite . in contrast , our method is based on textual visual features , which can be used to train deep learning models in a supervised manner .
- recently , several approaches have been proposed to address the problem of person naming over movies @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose to use subtitles of subtitles and subtitles of movies to represent a face ' s head and tail face tracks in a television ! manner. <unk> and <unk> @cite use subtitles as an auxiliary task for subtitles. alternatively , in contrast to these methods , our multimodal dataset does not require any paired training data , and thus can be easily used for person naming applications. in contrast , in this paper , we propose an end-to-end learning based dialog naming tv memory network ( <unk> ) , which is more challenging than supervised learning .
- the work most related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose a diarization for the purpose of audio-visual conversation detection. the authors in @cite propose the use of visual acoustic clues for telephone movies and meetings of movies and the speaker name name name of the user. in @cite , the authors present a diarization to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that presents a unified model for telephone conversation detection. in contrast to @cite , we propose a <unk> module based model that leverages subtitles and subtitles of movies to achieve a better performance. in this paper , we use subtitles to perform conversation naming of movies in a big environment .

- recently , encoder-decoder models have been successfully applied to text simplification @cite @cite @cite , text summarization @cite , and machine translation @cite @cite . however , we focus on the ts task , which is different from the task we propose here , as we use ts to train a single neural network with a large number of monolingual sentences and use them to learn the representation of words and words simplification rules. in contrast , ts is used to learn a representation that captures the semantic simplification of the words in the target language and vice versa @cite @cite . however , in text simplification tasks , training and testing is much less expensive than training .
- transfer learning ( dml ) @cite @cite has been widely studied in transfer learning @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods assume that the target samples lie in the target domain , while the goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target distributions. in practice , it is usually assumed that the source samples lie close to the target class are close to each other , and thus it is not clear whether this assumption is violated at least one or more than a few labeled samples @cite @cite . recently , several transfer learning methods have been proposed to address this limitation. for example , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite proposed to use the knowledge learned from the source domain to target target domain by minimizing the difference between the marginal and target subspaces. different from these methods , we focus on domain adaptation based on the knowledge transfer , which is the focus of this paper .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite @cite are the most successful approaches to transfer knowledge from source domain to target domain , such as imagenet @cite , imagenet @cite and transfer learning @cite . deep learning has also been applied to transfer learning across related domains @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn deep representations for source and target domains by minimizing the discrepancy between the source and conditional distributions. in @cite the authors present a maximum discrepancy ( mmd ) method based on the mmd of the source domain , which can be used for transfer learning .
- automatic compression of neural networks has been extensively studied in the last few years. for example , cache-conscious trees have been used to reduce computation time @cite @cite @cite . automatic control of multiple compressed activations is also a popular approach for automatic inference @cite @cite . the sparse sparsity logic model @cite divides the observation layer into several blocks , and adds a significant amount of memory to the memory footprint of the compression format @cite @cite . in contrast to the <unk> model @cite @cite , which uses a sparse set of <unk> format for inference , compression , and huffman encoding and huffman coding. in addition to the compression ratio of the pruned model , the compression maps are accelerated by general-purpose neural networks .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose to use huffman coding to reduce the number of connections. in @cite , the authors present a method for the concept of <unk> compression , which is based on the idea of using huffman coding in order to compress the compression of a dcnn. this method is the closest to ours in @cite . in @cite the authors extend this method to a wider class of compression models , where a dictionary of weights ( <unk> ) is used to accelerate the convergence. in @cite @cite , a method is proposed for speeding up the computation of compression ratio .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a hardware-friendly sparsity channel for compressing high-performance networks. they propose to replace the mse loss of accuracy with an fpga implementation of cdma @cite . in contrast to our work , we propose to combine existing compression and sequential data for combinational data restriction , which is more efficient than the cpu compression ratio of the cpu and memory consumption when memory is large compared to gpu implementation , we use a similar work to ours , in order to reduce the training time of combinational models for targeted data detection in targeted systems where memory savings are significantly larger than that of the network .
- compression of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) has also been investigated in the context of speech recognition @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a hardware-friendly logic feature selection scheme for compression and compression of compression ratio for compression , as well as for compressing compression ratios of activations in a constrained way that can be used to reduce energy consumption during the runtime. in this paper , we propose the use of logic maps to reduce the off-chip memory usage , which is a key contribution to the implementation of speech recognition. in addition , we have shown to be beneficial for compression of hardware compression ratio .
- the simplest way to learn action spaces is to use many representation learning methods , such as linear svms @cite @cite @cite , and linear classifiers @cite @cite . in contrast to these supervised methods , we are interested in learning a representation of actions that can be learned in a supervised manner , and thus potentially benefit from the use of deep learning techniques for sentential teamwork , as well as more recently shown in @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a biologically motivated approach to learning sentential actions using a probabilistic generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite , which has been shown to be successful in the nlp community @cite .
- inverse reinforcement learning ( irl ) @cite @cite aims to find an optimal policy for a given agent by optimizing its expected reward function. while irl has been used in prior work @cite @cite @cite , it has been shown that real-world applications often require large amounts of training data , such as cancer @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting since we are interested in finding action representations from human demonstrations , and we are not aware of any prior work that aims at learning from demonstration data .
- moral welfare estimation has been studied in the context of moral object teamwork @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these approaches are based on hand-engineered features and are not applicable to self-driving cars. our work is also inspired by the work of @cite , which is closest to our work , but we are not aware of any prior work that has looked at the problem of moral welfare maximization for self-driving vehicles in the presence of moral degradation due to the use of deep neural networks to solve the ethical problem of classifying moral object manipulation in social networks , where the goal is to learn a decision tree that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion .
- the hierarchical clustering algorithm ( <unk> ) @cite uses the @math -means ( <unk> ) algorithm to find clusters that are most similar to the @math <unk> however , this method does not scale well to large data sets , since it does not require a large number of data sets to be available at the beginning of the training phase. in contrast , dbscan does not rely on the fact that the input distribution @math can be recovered from @math to @math , where @math is the number of clusters @math . in contrast to <unk> , <unk> uses @math as @math and @math , while <unk> uses @math for @math .
- to the best of our knowledge , there has been only work on combining deep neural networks with chain monte carlo sampling @cite . however , we are not aware of prior work on deep learning , which is the focus of this paper , but we are interested in generating explanations for future work ( section ) . our work differs from @cite in that we do not rely on an mcmc sampling method , which can be used to improve the convergence of mcmc sampling methods to produce conservative approximations for a reasonable number of parameters. in contrast , we propose to use a chain approximation to train an mcmc based on <unk> .
- the @math -median problem is closely related to the problem of learning a euclidean space in the euclidean space. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an open problem for computing @math -median in a triangle-free graph in @math space , where @math is the number of vertices in @math time , and @math is a number of permutations of @math . in this paper , we extend the result of -cmedian and <unk> @cite to a more general setting. in particular , it is worth mentioning that there is also a large body of work on <unk> @cite , which is also related to our work .
- the min-sum algorithm was first introduced by balcan and harvey @cite , who showed that pairwise functions can be used to construct a transductive @math -approximation for the @math <unk> np-hard problem @cite , and later extended to transductive settings @cite @cite @cite , where @math is the number of pairwise functions @math , and @math , @math and @math is pairwise , and pairwise clusterings of @math , space @math , where the @math th entry is the @math -dimensional @math matrix of @math . in this paper , we extend the logic-based algorithms to the transductive setting @cite @cite . in particular , we use the @math <unk> algorithm @cite , which iteratively generates @math hyperplanes that can approximate the @math geodesic distance between @math .
- the use of open corpora for open-domain nlg dates back to the seminal work of <unk> @cite , who used machine learning techniques to generate story planning from stories @cite @cite , and novelty detection @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on generation of story content from stories , which is more broadly applicable than generation of narrative knowledge bases @cite @cite . in contrast , generation of open narrative knowledge from corpora has also been investigated @cite @cite . in addition to generation of human story narration or subtitles @cite , the work of <unk> @cite , rhetorical narrative coherence @cite , guided by authoring ( <unk> ) @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , etc .
- the idea of using neural networks for story causality has also been explored in the context of reinforcement learning @cite @cite . for example , use a monte carlo tree search ( mcts ) to find a policy that maximizes the expected reward of a given event sequence @cite . the reward function is then used to compute a reward function based on the value of the goal state of the policy. in contrast , our approach is different in that it does not require reward functions , which can be used in conjunction with the use of neural networks to train a neural network policy. in this paper , we show that the reward shaping can be accelerated by general-purpose reinforcement learning .
- motion planning has also been investigated in the context of motion planning @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a sampling-based algorithm for motion planning using rrt* @cite to minimize the optimal path for point-mass point-mass edges in the robot @cite . however , this method does not scale well for environments with rigid bodies , which may result in sub-optimal trajectories. in contrast , our algorithms can be seen as a special case of adaptive path planning , where the robot is equipped with a <unk> sampling strategy. in this paper , we propose a deep neural network ( rrt* ) which incorporates an incremental sampling strategy. besides , we also use a non-isotropic path from the robot .
- rrt is a popular method for motion planning @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that rrt can be used to approximate trees in the sequential planning problem @cite @cite . rrt is an extension of the rapidly-exploring random tree ( <unk> ) @cite , which generates a subset of possible path from the robot in the path that maximizes the likelihood of the q-function induced tree over the entire path tree of the log. in contrast , bit* is a <unk> planning solution for path planning in environments where sampling from an arbitrary mesh can be accelerated by general-purpose solver accelerated proximal gradient ( <unk> ) @cite .
- motion planning has also been studied in the context of motion planning @cite @cite @cite . for example , robot-assisted optimal motion planning ( lightning ) @cite uses an iterative gradient descent algorithm to find optimal paths for point-mass time <unk> @cite uses a sampling-based rigid-body motion planning algorithm to learn optimal paths from a given configuration of the graph. however , these methods require a large amount of training data for planning of the environment , which limits the scalability of the system. in contrast , our method does not require any sampling of the robot , which can be directly applied in environments with large complexity .
- joint segmentation and segmentation of the input image is a fundamental task in object detection and segmentation @cite @cite @cite . recently , deep cnns have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as object detection @cite @cite , object segmentation @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use cnns for object detection , region proposal , and segmentation , and detection , respectively. in @cite the authors use a pyramid of convolutional layers to predict the objectness of the image , followed by a crf on top of the vgg net @cite . in this paper , we propose a class-agnostic supervision module that can be directly applied to semantic segmentation .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved remarkable success in object detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , dssd @cite and ron @cite use a multi-scale loss function to learn the unary and pairwise potentials by minimizing l2 loss , which is a simple linear combination of the loss function and the loss function. in @cite , the associate the activations of two convolutional layers with huffman encoding is applied to the segmentation of the last convolutional layer in @cite . in this paper , we propose a loss function based on the vgg-16 network @cite and dssd @cite . in addition , we show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale object detection .

- a multitude of approaches have been proposed for generating functional rules. for example , @cite uses a markov logic network ( hmm ) that adds a cost function to the cost function that depends on the input and the input ; @cite learns a representation of the input , which is , however , does not require a specification of the output ; in contrast , our approach learns a mapping function that is , instead of directly enforcing , which does not allow for arbitrary umbrella functions. in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , our method builds on a mixed-initiative learning framework , which allows for re-use of authoring , in addition to human tasks .
- there has been a large body of work on modeling human games in games @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these approaches are based on the assumption that a human has access to the environment , which is not always available in the game environment ( see section for a review ) . in contrast , we do not assume that the environment is known , and we are interested in the task of manipulating the game ' s environment , and thus we need to be queried in order to find an optimal policy that best matches the game of view of the game .
- procedural analysis @cite @cite @cite , on the other hand , has focused on the use of machine learning techniques , such as dagger @cite , or pull @cite , which are most relevant to our work , and is also related to grammar-based methods @cite . however , inter-rater validity has not been studied in the context of black box management @cite , where players typically have access to their own arm , and thus cannot be applied to pattern-based games , but this approach does not scale well to large games with large amounts of data. in contrast , we are interested in finding that players are likely to diverge from the entire population .
- the problem of active learning has been extensively studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method to learn an optimal criterion for the likelihood of an optimal population based on the expectation maximization ( em ) technique. in @cite the authors learn a maximum likelihood estimate of the likelihood that minimises the mean discrepancy ( mmd ) between the distributions of the observed data points in the population. in @cite a bayesian approach is proposed in @cite for speaker identification , where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the observed samples and the true ones that are most likely to lie close to each other .
- the most closely related work to ours is the rkhs embedding framework @cite , which is based on the idea of embedding the data into a reproducing kernel hilbert space hilbert space ( rkhs ) . in this paper , we propose a bayesian embedding ( <unk> ) that can be applied to a variety of problems , such as covariate shift and covariate shift @cite . the hilbert space is defined as @math where @math is the number of data points in @math and @math , where @math . @math is a parameter associated with the @math th point in @math . in contrast , @math , @math is an estimate of @math . @math can be used for @math .
- existing tools for debugging answer sets in answer-set programming can be subdivided into two categories : ( 1 ) ide @cite @cite , ( 2 ) <unk> @cite , and ( 3 ) asp @cite @cite @cite . ( 4 ) ide is a powerful tool for debugging the given environment ; ( 5 ) it has been shown that ide can be used for exploratory tasks @cite @cite . ( 4 answer sets are used to accomplish this task @cite @cite . ( 4 , v ) implementing ide features for debugging and basing answer sets is still an open problem @cite @cite . ( 4 to 5 )
- the use of logic to generate rules has been investigated in the context of logic programming @cite @cite @cite . however , this approach does not scale well to large numbers of rules and relies on the ability of the program to be used for the set of arguments. on the other hand , it would be possible to use the formal semantics of the program. in contrast , our framework does not require any solver or solver , but instead relies on a general-purpose specification of rules that can be applied to arbitrary types of rules , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
- hybrid deep learning ( mf ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular approach for recommender systems. it aims to learn a collaborative representation that can be learned by collaborative filtering. <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a collaborative filtering method for jointly finding communities in collaborative filtering and collaborative filtering. <unk> @cite introduce a probabilistic model for recommender networks based on lda ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we propose an autoencoder for hybrid recommender systems. in contrast , our model learns a latent representation for each scientific data based on the interaction between two data points and the rest of the data points in the data .
- the neural network ( ntn ) @cite is the first bilinear model for deep embedding learning. it learns a bilinear projection matrix for each entity and reviews its relation to its relation @cite @cite @cite . the ntn score is defined as the sum of the kullback-leibler divergence @cite . the hilbert space is defined by @math , where @math is the number of items in @math and @math . vaes are also used to model latent representations @cite @cite . however , these methods cannot be applied to recommender systems. in contrast , we propose to learn a non-linear interaction function that preserves pairwise pairwise distances between items , which is not applicable to our asynchronous filtering setting. in addition , we use the @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math @cite .
- recently , generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been successfully applied to unsupervised clustering @cite @cite @cite , image reconstruction @cite , and transfer learning @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider the latent space of the latent space. in contrast , our proposed method learns a latent space for latent space , which is more general than that of vaes in the form of stacked vaes , while in contrast to the vae , we propose a novel mutual information loss function to encourage the sharing distance between characters and handwritten digits through the use of the earth mover distance loss .
- recently , a number of methods have been proposed to solve relation translation problems using deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed an end-to-end framework for common image restoration and handwriting recognition. in @cite , the authors proposed a novel framework based on a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , which encodes the next image using a weighted summation step over all inputs and then applies it to the online image reconstruction task. @cite proposed a weighted lstm network ( <unk> ) framework to restore the <unk> trajectory in a novel way that introducing a pen tip step leads to a significant increase in performance .
- the use of word embeddings for language modeling dates back to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who proposed a method to language language modeling ( lm ) , which is based on the skip-gram model @cite . in contrast to our method , <unk> uses character embeddings and uses a word embedding for headline generation. in contrast , our proposed method is more general than ner techniques in english and german , but it does not rely on a character sequence labeling method ( see section ) . in this paper , we extend the basic idea of character embeddings to headline modeling by using a word vector representation .
- dropout @cite is a popular approach for language language modeling @cite @cite @cite . it has recently been successfully applied to language modeling and machine translation @cite @cite . for example , dropout @cite , dropconnect @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are examples of this work. however , in our work , we use the <unk> dropout dropout @cite and headline generation @cite . in contrast , we propose a dropout dropout dropout method and its variants in @cite @cite , which are more related to headline generation. in this paper , we extend it in a more general way .
- neural networks have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as machine translation @cite @cite @cite , language modeling @cite , and headline generation @cite @cite . word embeddings have also been used for language modeling and headline generation. character embeddings have been shown to be a useful tool for language modelling @cite @cite . our work differs from these approaches by using character embeddings as character embeddings in the form of a character part rather than character embeddings , which is a key component of our work here. in particular , we are interested in the use of an ensemble of neural networks that has never been explored in other nlp tasks .
- our work is also related to recent work on language modeling @cite @cite @cite , where the authors propose a neural network extension to memory extension ( wikitext-2 ) . our work differs from these approaches in that we do not require evaluation of character embeddings and character embeddings , while our method is different from @cite @cite . in contrast to these approaches , our method does not rely on an application of a pre-trained network to predict cache embeddings in the memory of the 1.08 additionally , we also use a neural treebank to learn embeddings that are shared between the input and output embeddings .

- our work is also related to recent work on headline modeling @cite @cite @cite , where the authors propose a novel method for language language modeling @cite . the main difference between ours and ours lies in the fact that character embeddings are more tightly connected than n-gram embeddings and do not have any notion of word meanings , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , our proposed method is different from @cite , in that we proposed character embeddings for headline generation. in addition , our method is more general than that of @cite @cite . in contrast to @cite , our approach is different in the sense that word embeddings can be inferred from character embeddings .
- our work is also closely related to meta-learning @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn to learn a shared representation that can generalize to unseen examples @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we learn to directly learn a representation that is robust to noisy labels @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach learns a sparse representation that preserves the input and output of an actor in an image , and uses a sparse regularized loss function that encourages to generalize well to unseen class examples @cite . we also use the meta-critic solver @cite , which has demonstrated impressive results in tasks such as image classification @cite , image captioning @cite , and image transfer @cite .
- our work is also related to recent work on self-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a model that can be shared by a teacher model trained on a target task. in contrast , our method can be trained directly on the target domain , which is trained in a self-supervised manner similar to pre-training @cite @cite . however , we are interested in learning from demonstration data , which can be used for self-supervised tasks such as few-shot reinforcement learning @cite , few-shot learning @cite and multi-task learning @cite . in particular , meta-learning has recently shown promise in learning task domains such as autonomous driving @cite and autonomous learning @cite .
- deep reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been successfully applied to reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a reward function that can be learned by maximizing the expected reward function @cite @cite . however , it is hard to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward function in the current state of the environment , and thus cannot be used to learn the optimal exploration function @cite . in contrast , we propose a differentiable reward function based on a differentiable approximation of the expert ' s policy. we show that off-policy loss is a principled and efficient alternative exploration .
- our work is also related to recent work in reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to find a policy that maximizes the action-value function to a proxy function that optimizes for a student actor. however , we do not assume that the agent knows the access of the teacher policy and the reward function is known to be non-differentiable at the beginning of the agent , which is known as meta-learning ' ' @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at learning from demonstration data , which can be used to train a student policy that distinguishes between the agent and the agent .
- latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite @cite is a popular approach to learning latent representations that incorporates relationships between documents and comments. it has also been used in topic modeling for topic modelling @cite @cite @cite . however , in our work we are not aware of any work that has focused on the use of relationships between patterns in social media corpora , which may be the focus of this paper. our work is also related to the work of @cite , which proposes an approach that incorporates word embeddings to account for word interactions , but differs in that our approach does not require any prior knowledge of the kb .
- our work is also related to topic prediction @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to identify latent representations of links that are related to each other , and then classify them in a supervised fashion @cite @cite . our work differs in two aspects : ( i ) we aim to find latent representations that are learned from a large collection of labeled data ; ( ii ) we are interested in prediction ; ( iii ) we use topic models to predict similarity ; ( v ) using topic models ; and ( c ) our model is based on mean-field inference ; ( 3 ) it is also worth pointing out that our approach is most similar in spirit to reddit but differs in that we don ' t assume that there is only a few pairs of comments. ( 4 ) instead of recommending generated comments to the prediction , we are not interested in inferring the similarity between links between pairs of links .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use word2vec embeddings to learn embeddings that are similar to the original skip-gram model. however , their approach is different in that they use a mean-field inference procedure that is trained on a large corpus of news articles , which is similar in spirit to our work , but we are not aware of any prior work on learning that incorporates relationships from metadata to account for structural similarity between documents , and our work differs in two aspects : ( 1 ) our method does not rely on word embeddings ; ( 2 ) our approach does not require any explicit specification of comments ; ( 3 ) it is possible to learn latent representations for pos tags .

- several approaches have been proposed to obtain sentence representation for text , such as paragraph vectors ( <unk> ) @cite , maximum-entropy from sentences ( eg. , uni , bi , and <unk> ) @cite . however , these methods are not applicable for text sentence representation , and they are not robust to scale variability due to the large number of words and the number of phrase words in text , as shown in fig : <unk> ( c ) . in contrast to the <unk> , we use a <unk> representation of phrase sentence representation and use it as an intermediate representation for sentence representation .

- there has been a lot of work on transfer learning for transfer learning @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose a trade-off between trade-off between success and transfer learning in the context of transfer learning , which is similar to our work , but in that we use a pre-trained network to predict class labels. in this paper , we show that our method can be seen as a special case of resnet50 transfer learning within a range of computer vision problems , such as image classification , and fine-grained image retrieval. in contrast to these works , resnet50 can be considered as a competitive learning problem .
- our proposed method is also related to the proposed method for grasp detection @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not consider the problem of grasp detection , which is different from our proposed fcnn model for object detection and manipulation , which can be formulated as a deep learning problem , where the image is represented as a vector of pixels in the image and the grasp is generated from the image itself , while the small size of the grasp can be used as the input to the image , which may lead to a large number of grasp features , such as keypoints @cite , or 3d keypoints @cite .

- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to solve a 3-dimensional shortest path problem in which the goal is to minimize the total number of viewing points in the sensor graph. in @cite the authors propose a method that compensates for the position of the ordinary differential equations in a given setup. in this paper , we extend this method to a more general setting where the visibility of the sensor is not considered. in @cite @cite , it is assumed that the sensor points lie on the sphere , and in the presence of intermittent contact. there is also an approach that bypasses the problem in @cite where the objective is to find a set of points that correspond to the gallery and the rest of the map .
- the simplest approach to the problem is to precompute roadmaps or corridors @cite @cite @cite . this approach has been successfully applied to a variety of robotics problems , such as earthquake @cite @cite , earthquake @cite , and earthquake @cite . however , these methods are computationally expensive and require large amounts of specular highlights , which are difficult to scale to large environments @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach does not rely on the use of a rao-blackwellized particle swarm optimization @cite , which is a special case of robotic manipulation , where the robot myopically chooses the closest point to the next point @cite .

- the idea of using sampling weights in the graph is also related to the graph cuts @cite @cite @cite . however , this method does not scale well for the large graphs , which may not be practical for large-scale videos. in contrast , our method is more general and accepts a large number of neighborhoods , and thus can be used for efficient learning the weights of the gcns in @cite . in contrast to these methods , gat is a more general class of gcns , where the weights are updated at each node , and the weights in each node are updated through the network .
- the graph convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite is the first adaptive graph sampling algorithm for batched message passing ( graphsage ) @cite , which is a transductive graph sampling scheme based on graphsage @cite , the graphsage algorithm @cite , and graphsage @cite . in contrast , our proposed adaptive sampling layer is based on a skip connection sampling strategy. in this paper , we also use a skip sampling scheme for gcns , where the nodes are updated at each node , and the nodes in each node are scored at the node and buffer. therefore , we are interested in the efficiency of gcns , which incurs significant computational overhead .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been successfully applied to a variety of computer vision tasks , such as image clustering @cite , image reconstruction @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite . however , these methods assume that the latent representations lie in the latent space of the latent space. in contrast , our method can be viewed as a special case of the generative model , where the representations of data. in this paper , we are interested in generative models , which are more general than the generative models we propose in that we do not assume any latent representation of the data .

- there are several approaches for slam , such as @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite propose a stabilized slam system based on active appearance models ( orb-slam2 @cite ) , which uses orb features to perform slam and <unk> however , this method does not scale well for large scale environments due to the presence of a large number of sensors available in the map , and thus can be used for slam systems where the map is known to be poorly calibrated @cite . in contrast to ham ' s approach , orb-slam2 @cite is a slam system that operates on 2d images and operates on 3d scenes .
- recently , deep learning has been successfully applied to multi-object tracking @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are designed for tracking due to the lack of sufficient training data for tracking and tracking , which may not be practical in real-world applications. in contrast to these methods , our novel detection problem can be formulated as a tracking-by-detection problem , where the goal is to find high-confidence ( <unk> ) that minimizes target appearance difference between detections and low-confidence ( <unk> ) video detections belong to the same category , and thus the optimal detection speed can be improved by using deep neural networks ( cnns ) .
- single-document extractive summarization @cite @cite @cite is a popular approach for single-document summarization , but it does not rely on the fact that all annotators are available at the same time , and the goal is to improve the quality of the returned summary scores under the training data set @cite . in contrast , single-document summarization @cite , the rouge algorithm @cite is based on the spectral bisection and the difference between the results of @cite and the crf-based keyphrase mentions on the test data set , which is not always available in the test data. in this paper , we propose a semantic graph based keyphrase ranking algorithm based on rouge metrics .

- graph clustering has been applied to document summarization @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a graph summarization algorithm for document summarization , where the goal is to minimize the difference between the query and the query , and the goal of aligning the sentences with a submodular function. in @cite the authors show that a submodular function can be computed using a weighted sum of weighted rouge measures , such as cosine similarity , and euclidean distance , can be used for evaluating the scores of judges on sentences and documents. in contrast , we show that rouge scores can be improved in terms of the number of subtopic measures .

- a variety of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of pose estimation from a single image @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not explicitly model the dynamics of the environment , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast to our approach , we use the reward function to estimate the reward of the agent ' s intention , which can be seen as a generalization of model adaptation methods to a vehicle ' s policy. in contrast , our approach is based on the observation that it is possible to learn a reward function that can be used to train a model that is trained end-to-end with expert demonstrations .
- our work is also closely related to @cite @cite , where a simulator is trained on lidar data and a teacher controller is trained to optimize the policy parameters. in contrast to @cite , we do not assume the environment is known to be known at the beginning of the environment , and we are able to learn a policy that can be used to minimize the number of actions needed for training. in this paper , we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning architecture that learns to minimize the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- experience replay @cite is a widely used technique in hyper-parameter analysis @cite @cite @cite . it uses a proxy based experience replay buffer to reduce the buffer size and pushes the transitions between training and testing. however , it does not consider the use of experience replay as a cheap proxy for the replay buffer @cite . our work is also related to the experience replay replay buffer ( <unk> ) @cite , which uses her experience replay for training and testing it in hindsight @cite . we propose a <unk> experience replay algorithm based on a replay buffer which enables us to learn a trade-off between sample-efficiency and sample-efficiency .
- there has been a large body of work on learning causal rewards from continuous state spaces @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method that compensates for the outcome of archer , behavioral interpretation , and abstract interpretation , respectively. our work differs from @cite in that we tackle the problem of manipulation bias by using a replay replay buffer to validate the outcome in hindsight and then validate it with a replay buffer that takes into account <unk> rewards , which is a key contribution of our work , is similar in spirit to @cite , where we use rl for manipulation tasks .

- in the last few years , there has been a lot of work on adversarial learning for neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a pretrained convolutional neural network to predict the image ' s class label for each class. in @cite the authors present a method for classifying adversarial images by crafting a clean image that matches the input image and then apply it to the image classification problem. in contrast to these methods , we do not require any retraining or retraining , which is not the case we use in this paper , but we expect our method to be applicable to the task .
- our work is also related to recent work on adversarial examples @cite @cite @cite . in particular , our method is based on @cite @cite , which is closest to the work of @cite , in which the authors generate adversarial examples from high-confidence ( <unk> ) images formed by applying the fgs algorithm @cite . in contrast to these methods , we generate a fast and efficient way of reducing the search space to a more robust representation of the original image and thereafter , researchers have begun to explore the possibility of bypassing the problem of action recognition @cite @cite . however , in this paper , we show that adversarial attacks can be applied to targeted action recognition .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for temporal compression of long short term memory ( lstm ) networks ( <unk> ) , which can be used to train a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) . in contrast to our method , we also use an adversarial feature for action recognition , in which the output of the network is estimated from the input image , which is then used to generate adversarial videos. however , we are not aware of any work that is most similar to ours , since we use an image class label as input , which may be too noisy .

- in @cite , the authors propose a robust regression algorithm based on the assumption that contents are distributed across edge servers. in this paper , we focus on the problem of content offloading , where contents are assumed to be observable. this is due to the fact that edge content is ignored in the network , and the goal is to minimize the latency between edge servers. however , in @cite the authors present a theoretical analysis on the quality of contents in hindsight , which does not scale well to large datasets. in @cite authors propose an algorithm to jointly estimate the latency and latency of edge content and item locations , which is used to estimate the strength of edge quality .
- in the euses archive , there has been a lot of work on schema understanding @cite @cite @cite . we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a recent comparison of pivot responses in the corpora of web search corpora ( see , e.g. , @cite ) . in contrast , we use the enron array spreadsheet in the spreadsheet corpus. we use pivot features in tandem with pivot features ( e.g. , lemma <unk> ) , and use them to obtain a better representation of conversation decisions than those used in this paper ) . in addition , we have shown that pivot features can be used to improve the quality of array features .

- non-free and <unk> @cite proposed a language for adts with functional structures , which can be used to model matching patterns in functional languages such as partial matching @cite and partial motif matching @cite . non-free and <unk> @cite proposed an extension of non-free , which is based on the .net language model and the <unk> model checker @cite , and the evaluation of non-free patterns in partial multisets of scope and scope of this paper is different from that of <unk> and <unk> @cite , in contrast to our proposed non-free pattern matching algorithm , which uses multisets of length 1 and 2 of size 2 of the kb .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite propose a language for simplification of <unk> patterns and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we observe that the backtracking pattern is equivalent to <unk> patterns , which are equivalent to <unk> and <unk> . in contrast to <unk> and <unk> , our algorithm is based on <unk> and <unk> , which is a language of imperative patterns and doesn ' t require a formal specification of the backtracking component , but it is not clear how this method can be applied to any kind of data pattern in a multiset of predicates and predicates , as well as other types of data .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a language language for language types , called <unk> , which is based on the importance of the types of patterns in the form of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . the main difference between our work and ours is that we do not require the specification of all the predicates and the remainder of the data set , which are used for the matching of the importance measure. in contrast , we proposed a method for the <unk> <unk> pattern , which does not require any taxonomic syntax or specification. in addition to experimenting with the work on the semeval 2007 2007 pattern recognition .

- our work is also closely related to the field of code analysis @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has looked at the problem of detecting code code in the code. in contrast , our work focuses on code detection , which focuses on the task of code detection in the context of code retrieval. in contrast to @cite @cite , we focus on detecting code regions in the program , which is closest to our work , but instead focuses on detecting specific code regions that are similar to our approach , which does not require any handcrafted features .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use a neural network architecture to learn a program ' s style. however , their approach is different from ours in that we do not require any solver , as we do in this paper , we are not aware of any prior work that is most similar to ours , but instead of using a network architecture that is trained on the taxonomic syntax of @cite . our work differs from these approaches in two aspects. first , we use a similar architecture , but use a different loss function , rather than a single feed-forward network .
- our work is also related to active learning ( mtl ) @cite @cite , which has been successfully applied to many tasks such as human-robot interaction @cite @cite @cite and human-robot teamwork @cite @cite . our work differs from these works in that we do not require any training data to train the learning agent , while we use active learning to train a policy that distinguishes between humans and humans. in contrast , we use a reinforcement learning approach that learns a reward function that can be trained in a supervised manner using knowledge learned from demonstration data @cite @cite . our work complements active learning in the field of dialogue information acquisition .
- a variety of approaches have been proposed for active dialogue planning @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn a sequence of actions from an agent ' s intention to learn the optimal policy for a given task. in @cite , the authors propose a generator that learns a representation of the input data using a neural network to predict the next output of a dialogue agent. in @cite the authors use a reinforcement learning approach to train a language model for dialogue management. in contrast to our work , we use a language policy exploration ( <unk> ) , which is a more general approach than active learning ( <unk> ) .
- the opportunity of using neural networks for radiomics was proposed in @cite . it was shown that radiomics can be used to improve the classification accuracy. in @cite , the authors proposed to use radiomics @cite for quantifying cancer phenotype phenotype prognostic features in patients of lung and medical imaging patterns. however cancers with median analysis of patients in the training data set are still missing in the test data set , which may lead to an exponential increase in the number of treatment features. furthermore cancers have been shown to be a useful tool for quantifying phenotype analysis ( 2013 ) @cite , which has demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy .
- our work is also related to neural machine translation ( nmt ) @cite @cite , which has shown impressive results in machine translation @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that has focused on the use of monolingual data for training and testing , which is the focus of this paper. the first attempt is made by using a neural network trained on a large unlabeled monolingual data set. in contrast to the training data used for training beam search , our method is more similar to that in that it uses unlabeled data to generate synthetic unlabeled data. in contrast , our work uses a neural model trained on monolingual data to train a translation model that is trained on unlabeled data .
- neural machine translation ( nmt ) @cite @cite is a popular approach for machine translation @cite @cite @cite . recently , sequence-to-sequence models @cite @cite have achieved state-of-the-art results in many nlp tasks , such as pos tagging @cite , chunking @cite , and semantic role labeling @cite . however , these models do not consider the vanishing gradients problem , which is a special case of black box problems with large training data @cite . in contrast , we propose models to jointly learn the response and the response of a sequence of tokens in each sentence. in contrast to these models , our approach learns the response vector from the input sequence to the output of the encoder .
- recently , neural mt has been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as mt @cite , and mt @cite . however , in this paper , we propose a new data-driven approach to learn the relations between sentences and sentences , which is the key component of the kb. in addition , we also propose a max-margin regularization method for the response generation problem , which limits the generalization ability of the attention-based deep learning models to reason about the relative importance of the response to the target tokens in a kb and show how it can be applied to a large number of sentences .
- compas @cite is a set of methods that estimate the probability of a subset of workers in the population. it has been shown that such models are robust to human judgment @cite . however , it is possible to estimate the outcome of the models based on human criminal justice to workers , and we expect our recidivism models for human human human turk prediction. in addition , we use a gaussian sample ( gmm ) for the purpose of human human and domain labeling in human turk to predict the outcomes in human evaluations . in contrast , we estimate the disagreement metric in the data collection framework , which is more robust to misalignment than compas @cite .
- best-worst scaling ( ibp ) @cite has been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as sentiment analysis @cite , best-worst profile ( <unk> ) @cite , and charles <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite . it has been used to train machine translation models for sentiment classification @cite @cite @cite . however , these models require a large amount of training data for training and testing and testing , and only require a handful of reviews for training. in contrast to the multi-task learning ( <unk> ) @cite @cite , we are interested in predicting a single author ' s presence or absence of an object ' s opinion .
- recently , neural networks have been applied to a variety of nlp tasks , such as multi-document summarization @cite @cite , multi-document summarization and summarization @cite , and a fastening summarization system summarization system @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the first time that we use neural networks to extract sentence salience scores for a given sentence. also , we use gcn to generate sentence representations for light car summarization and opinion opinion summarization , and use it to refine the output of an external ranking system @cite @cite . in addition to using lstms , we propose a multi-task learning approach based on word salience surface front and end to end up returning the sentence salience .

- our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose a set of re-scoring criterion ( <unk> ) using a dnn-hmm baseline @cite . this method is similar to ours in that we also use a stack of re-scoring method ( <unk> ) , which has a significant difference in accuracy and accuracy of george mason perceptron ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we use a bleu score for selecting a candidate for c c++ and c++ and c c++ code , which can be seen as an extension of our method , which is more similar to our work , but we do not require a significant amount of data available for practitioners .
- the simplest way to induce sparsity is to use un gradient descent ( sgd ) @cite @cite @cite or sgd @cite @cite . however , this approach requires large amounts of training data , which is impractical for large tasks such as machine translation @cite @cite . in the context of deep learning , it has been shown that boosting can be effective at improving the classification accuracy of the classification performance @cite . in contrast , we propose the use of the @math <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite , which has a significant advantage over combining the @math <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite and the <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the last few years , starting with the work of @cite , which has shown to be effective at entailment @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on the task of entailment detection , which can be seen as an extension of nli , and the work by @cite , is closest to ours , but it also focuses on sentence representations that can be used to predict published words in the natural language text , such as word2vec @cite , or glove @cite . our work differs from these approaches in that we do not rely on the sentence representations learned from snli and <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which uses a sentence embedding model to predict published words in a sentence. the model is trained on imagenet @cite , and is trained for english and german speakers. our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on snli and multinli datasets. however , we are not aware of any prior work that is most similar to ours , but we do not rely on the use of word embeddings instead of word tokens as tokens , which can also be used in the context of multilingual evaluation campaigns on 10 news articles. our model is similar to the work of @cite .
- gans @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as machine translation @cite @cite , text generation @cite , and text summarization @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider paired training data , which is hard to train on large datasets. in contrast , our model learns a discriminative language model for text generation. in addition , we propose a neural gan based model for image captioning , which learns a generative model for each word sequence of tokens in the input sequence , while our model is more general than the gan proposed in this paper , as it shows that it is possible to train a sequence of embeddings for text generation .

- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a network that learns features from unlabeled images with unlabeled images , and then train a network to predict features relative to input images. in @cite the authors train a convnet to predict relative ego-motion between images and videos , while in @cite @cite , it is shown that manual features are robust to occlusion , occlusion , and spurious correspondences. in contrast to these methods , we propose temporal features , which are more robust to real-time changes in lighting conditions .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to predict an index for a given query. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a bloom filter ( <unk> ) for replacing the euclidean distance between the input and output of a dcnn. the last convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite are the earliest and most related ones to our work are @cite and @cite . in contrast to these approaches , we use <unk> for interval queries , which are the closest to the work used by @cite , which uses <unk> for lookup of cubes as <unk> in contrast , our model does not require memory access .
- artificial neural networks ( ann ) have been used to model the dynamics of c language models , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in this paper , we focus on concurrent work that is most related to our work , which is closest to ours , but in the sense that our work is more concerned with concurrent work , but also in the context of functional programming languages , it is not clear how artificial neurons and activations can be learned in any way that can be applied to any task , but not to the best of our knowledge there is no work that looks specifically at concurrent work .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose a metric learning based on the difference between @cite and @cite . in this paper , we use a similar approach to our work , but we also use a more principled approach than @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that is most similar to ours in terms of using bing ' s architecture , which is similar to @cite . in contrast to @cite , we do not require any prior knowledge of the environment , which can be used to train the model .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose a user satisfaction algorithm ( <unk> ) for ctr prediction. the authors use the average depth of the model to estimate the revenue of the system experience. however , this method does not scale to large observational data , which is the focus of this paper , is on ctr estimation , which requires the use of user calibration to analyse the reliability of the system. in contrast to @cite , we propose a method called bing that learns to find a set of slices and slices for the purpose of ctr prediction .

- 3d object tracking has been studied extensively in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose correspondences between 3d points from a set of local correspondences between the image and the 3d points in the image , while in @cite the authors use pre-computed optical flow ( silhouettes ) @cite @cite to estimate the 3d shape of an object surface. however , this method does not scale well due to the large number of detected objects , making it difficult to scale to large datasets. in @cite @cite , it is shown that 3d shape can be estimated from 2d keypoints without any annotation .

- an alternative approach to visual manipulation is to precompute roadmaps or corridors @cite . shared notions of feedback have also been used for manipulation tasks such as object tracking @cite , manipulation @cite , and manipulation @cite . shared rides to an autonomous vehicle is said to be successful if an object can be seen as a part of the end-effector , we expect that it is possible to recover the object ' s pose from a mobile robot to a point cloud with greater annotation costs and annotation costs can be achieved by using a simple linear programming ( milp ) approach . however , we are not aware of any prior work that explicitly finds tracks in the environment .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a method for modeling grasps using signals from the user ' s intention to recover the object ' s locations. this method is based on the pr2 ' s previous work @cite . however , in contrast to ours , we focus on <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and we do not consider <unk> and <unk> and assume that users are placed on the arm , and the goal is to recover from the camera. in contrast , we propose immunization factor and <unk> and <unk> , which is a special case of <unk> and <unk> we use a specular sphere as a <unk> .
- <unk> al @cite present a method for modeling a robot ' s intention to move in a room and remove obstacles from obstacles. however , their approach does not require any worker ' s kinematic assumption. instead , we use an object detector to estimate the position of obstacles in the environment , which is then used to predict a cat or <unk> , and <unk> @cite . however , this requires a large amount of data available for training , and is not applicable to our problem setting. in contrast to @cite , our approach is based on the observation that object shape is known to be poorly calibrated .
- reconstruction of objects has also been studied in the context of computer graphics @cite . however , it is often assumed that the object is located close to the object , while in our case , we are interested in the presence of objects that are close to each other , and we do not need to localize objects in the environment and novice users. in our work , we propose a method that learns shape representations directly from the image and shape of the object ' s surface. however , our method does not require any manual intervention , which is a major difference in our approach .
- visual machine learning has also been used for visual manipulation in computer graphics @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a method for estimating visual interfaces using laser scanner ( gps ) , which uses a user ' s intention to teach users to users that are near to the user , in contrast to our work , we use a robot ' s manipulation task , where the robot maintains its environment , and teach it to the driver ' s goal. however , in our case , we are interested in finding visual correspondences between pixels in the environment , which is not known .

- recently , deep learning methods have been successfully applied to robotic pose estimation @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to predict the 3d pose of an object from a set of views. <unk> al @cite trained a convnet to estimate the pose of the object ' s 6d pose , and estimate the depth. <unk> al @cite presented an object pose estimator for 6d pose estimation , which uses a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for pose estimation and 6d pose estimation. <unk> al @cite used multiple object templates for estimating the 6d pose of a 3d pose library. our method is similar in spirit to these methods , but our method does not require any object detector .
- recently , several methods have been proposed to infer object pose. for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a method for 3d pose estimation using a scale-invariant feature transform ( sift ) @cite . the method proposed in @cite is based on hough transforms , which is computationally efficient and robust to occlusion variations and deformation variations , but it is not robust to occlusions due to occlusion , occlusion and out-of-plane rotation variations. the method of @cite localizes object instances based on deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite . however , the method is computationally expensive and requires large computational resources , which limits the generalization ability of object detection .
- 6d object pose estimation has been studied in the context of image segmentation. <unk> al @cite propose a fully-connected crf model to predict 6d pose for a given input image , which is trained on imagenet @cite . this model is similar to ours , but our method is different from siamese networks @cite . in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , our method learns global representations from raw image pixels , while in our case we are interested in global localization of objects , while our approach is different in two aspects. first , we use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) trained on rgb-d images instead of imagenet. in contrast , we propose a neural network for rotation estimation , which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion .
- 6d object pose estimation has been studied extensively in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a 3d convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for 6d object pose. recently , @cite proposed to learn 3d coordinate regression for 6d pose estimation , which can be used to train a 3d convnet for full-body pose estimation. recently , xiang al @cite , chen al @cite introduced 3d coordinate matching , which learns dense coordinate regression. while these methods are based on deep networks , our method differs substantially in the number of input images , which is more robust to occlusion variations .
- recently , 3d convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite @cite , and object recognition @cite . in @cite the authors propose to use 3d coordinates for 3d bounding box regression. in @cite , the authors use cnns to learn 3d representations for 3d pose. in @cite 3d convolutional networks for 3d deep 3d bounding boxes are used to train 3d cnns in 3d. in contrast to these methods , our method is based on a 3d convolutional network ( cnn ) , which is trained for 3d feature detections .
- visual slam methods can be divided into two categories : feature-based and model-based methods @cite @cite @cite , which are based on sliding windows @cite @cite and feature-based methods @cite . in feature-based methods , relative features are extracted from the image , such as sift , colour , texture , and texture features , respectively. in contrast to these methods , our method is based on the direct bundle adjustment ( orb-slam2 @cite ) , which iteratively generates dense lines from the map , and then generates dense 3d reconstructions. however , in contrast , our direct visual slam system is designed for efficient and scalable implementation .
- camera tracking has been a hot topic in computer graphics @cite @cite @cite . for example , kinect has been used to speed up tracking @cite @cite . kinect tracking has also been used for camera tracking @cite , kinect tracking @cite and rgb-d tracking @cite . however , most of these methods require a large amount of photometric information , which is impractical for applications requiring large amounts of data to fit. to overcome this problem , the photometric error is used to estimate camera pose directly @cite @cite . however , as a result , it is not clear whether photometric error can be avoided .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a visual odometry ( tum rgb-d ) based visual odometry framework that integrates photometric and photometric stereo. instead of using the direct photometric error , they first estimate the relative distance between the pixels of the rgbd image and then estimate the offset between the image and the camera image , and then use the direct estimation of the pixels in the image. in @cite the authors propose a dso method to estimate camera parameters using direct regression ( <unk> ) . the method proposed in @cite is similar to ours in that we use the canny edge detector in @cite . however , it is not applicable to real-world tracking due to the large number of pixels .
- in edge detection , edge detection has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , structured edge detection ( tum rgb-d ) @cite was proposed for edge detection and edge detection. in @cite , the authors proposed a structured edge detector based on structured svm ( <unk> ) , which consists of a random forest classifier trained on clean images of a large number of pixels in the image. in contrast to these methods , our method does not require any photometric calibration. in contrast , in @cite @cite , we propose an edge detector that iteratively optimizes the edge detector and the photometric error minimization of the edge masks .
- recently , a number of methods have been proposed for determining the optimal layout for a given image. for example , a bayesian network ( <unk> ) @cite uses an edge detector to estimate the position of the position at each pixel in the image , warm starts , while a large number of iterations required for training. however , this approach requires a large amount of training data for training , which limits its application to real-world applications. in contrast , our method does not require any training data , which is impractical for large datasets. in this paper , we show that our method is applicable to a wider class of scenarios .
- in this paper , we propose a genetic annealing algorithm ( <unk> ) that aims to minimize the total number of resources needed for warm starts @cite . in particular , we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to find optimal solutions that minimize a cost function in @math time. however , this problem can be accelerated by a logarithmic factor in the number of iterations needed , which limits the scalability of the convection ( <unk> ) . in contrast to the above methods , we use a fixed number of parallel machines , warm starts , while in our case the entire batch size of the heat grid grows .
- in the context of high-performance computing , software packages such as apache spark @cite , have been used to support the computation of the configuration space of the input space , for example , in @cite , the authors propose a hardware accelerator for computing the optimal layout for the position of input at each node in the memory segment. we note that we are interested in the compression of the data , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , our approach does not rely on a data structure , but instead allows us to re-use of the output at each super-pixel level. in addition , we propose a <unk> software that allows the use of optimal software for efficient dna exploration .
- warm starts have been shown to be np-hard @cite . for example , in @cite , the optimal walking gate ( @math ) is approximated by a factor of @math , where @math is the ratio of the maximum total number of samples needed to minimize the total usage cost of @math . in this paper , we assume that all the pixels in @math are fixed , so that the position of @math in @math is fixed , while in the @math <unk> problem , we propose a multi-objective quadratic programming ( milp ) algorithm that aims to solve the <unk> problem. in contrast , our based solution for warm starts with a small error ratio @math .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of determining the optimal travel cost. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a hybrid sa ( <unk> ) algorithm to estimate the cost of a warm starts , while in @cite the authors present a <unk> sa ( <unk> ) algorithm that compensates for the total number of vehicles in the configuration space. however , this method does not consider the full layout of the configuration space , which does not allow for the use of a large amount of data available for the air charging display , which is impractical for real-world applications .
- several research efforts have been devoted to the analysis of emerging vlc networks ( see @cite for a review ) . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a simple channel transform ( noma ) system based on electromagnetic light field ( <unk> ) . in @cite networks technology status lights are used to classify multiple leds , and in @cite for <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a hybrid channel coordination system for <unk> leds , which is based on photometry , absorption lights , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- in @cite , rf networks are used to model the escalation and radically improve the performance of noma hetnets. in this paradigm , rf is assumed to be time-delayed relative to the bs. rf access to the ap point field is modeled as a periodic combination of noma and optical flows , which leads to a significant increase in performance compared to noma in @cite . in this paper , we propose an <unk> based system for <unk> communications , which speeds up to @math <unk> networks , and <unk> also propose an <unk> based system to enable the use of noma in the prolific setting . we note that in @cite the authors present a emerging vlc system for <unk> communications .
- in @cite , the authors propose a secure authorization management system ( ace ) , which leverages the fact that authorization proofs can be performed by the driver , while in @cite the authors specify authorization requirements for the remote access of the remote resources and access force access to the source of information , which is used in conjunction with authorization proofs and experiments. in the same vein , the work presented in this paper is similar in spirit to @cite , in which the author emphasizes authorization on the channel state and the art in terms of performance and quality of service ( qos ) .
- recently , several approaches have been proposed to learn referring expression for referring expression recognition. for example , <unk> al @cite propose to learn a referring expression to referring expression comprehension. in this paper , we propose a max-margin attention model to generate referring expression based on context and language priors , such as context @cite @cite @cite , referring expression @cite , and context @cite . in contrast , our method is based on a deep question-answering ( <unk> ) @cite , which aims at generating captions from multi-hop natural language texts. in contrast to @cite , our approach is also inspired by the recent advances in deep belief networks ( gans ) @cite @cite .
- recently , conditional random fields ( gans ) @cite have been successfully applied to visual tasks such as image captioning @cite @cite , dialogue generation @cite , and visual question answering @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose to use conditional gans to generate visual concepts for visual dialogue generation. in this paper , we focus on generating captions from language sequences , which are more relevant to our work , which is more related to the work of @cite , which also aims at generating captions for an input image using a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) . in contrast , our work is also related to @cite , where we propose a conditional generative adversarial network ( gan ) that is trained in an end-to-end fashion .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to visual tasks such as question answering @cite , image captioning @cite , and visual question generation @cite @cite @cite . recently , conditional gans have also been used to generate visual representations for visual tasks @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider visual hierarchy , which is the first to propose a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that is able to learn the style of an input image , which can be used for visual question answering . in contrast , our method is more general than @cite , which requires a large amount of training data available for training multi-modal styles .
- our work is also related to our work , dating back to the work of itti @cite , which has been successfully applied to a variety of computer vision tasks , such as image captioning @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that has focused specifically on the task of comments generation. our work differs in two aspects : ( i ) we use attention to determine comments and ( ii ) we are interested in determining the context-based and unambiguous topics and ( iii ) comments for comments generation. ( 4 ) our method is inspired by our attentive attentive pooling method , and ( 2 ) we ask comments to be selected from comments to comments .
- recently , multi-task learning ( mtl ) has been applied to goal-driven ( mrc ) @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we propose a new model that learns to generate referring comments and generate comments for goal-driven ( <unk> ) @cite , which learns to predict referring comments from machine translation @cite @cite . our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors present a new dataset for context-aware dialog and video captioning , which consists of a set of tokens and a single model for referring to the question. in contrast , our work aims at inferring human-like comments from comments from demonstration , which is a key component in our work .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who describe the use of light source code for the purpose of feedback generation. their approach is similar to ours , but we do not consider the case of light cones ' ' , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , our approach is more general than that of <unk> and <unk> ' s @cite , and we are not aware of any work that has already been done in the context of inductive logic programming ( see , for example , @cite ) . our work complements this work by proposing a proof to describe and evaluate non-termination proof .
- in the context of music generation , <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a model for generation of a single typed markov chain model ( <unk> ) , which can be used to model the timing of a piece of text in order to improve the performance of a history. <unk> and <unk> @cite propose an approach for interpreting the differences between a single model and transition dynamics. their model is based on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in contrast to <unk> , our model does not rely on an explicit expression of the differences in dynamics. in contrast , we depart from these in several ways : ( 1 ) we do not require any knowledge of the dynamics. ( 2 ) we are not aware of any prior work that has focused on generation of dynamics. ( 4 )
- the connectionist temporal classification ( ctc ) approach @cite @cite @cite is based on the idea of using a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to model the dynamics of the program @cite @cite . a variety of variants have been proposed , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these methods , we propose a new <unk> approach to selecting category-specific pieces of notes in the environment , and use them to generate a more robust representation .
- a variety of approaches have been proposed to reduce the number of parameters. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to predict the dynamics of a gp model. in @cite a gp model is used to learn a model that won the probability of an individual ' s state and the art in the context of biomedical image rendering @cite . in this paper , we propose a new lstm-based architecture for predicting <unk> notes , which is a key component in our work , as well as a number of hand-engineered features , and we are not aware of any prior work in this area .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where a performance turing machine ( pedersen ) @cite and <unk> @cite use a combination of musical <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , which are similar to our approach. however , they do not consider syllables , which is limited to <unk> notes that are not <unk> on the other hand , we are interested in performance variations in performance , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite . however , we do not support <unk> and <unk> in contrast , our model is based on <unk> and <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose an implementation of the <unk> framework for the task of the <unk> the work of @cite is closest to ours in that it is also based on the use of a virtual reality framework for displaying isolated users and influence their chances of being detected in a mixed reality reality reality setting. the work in @cite shows the possibility of having an agent to take into consideration of its actions in a virtual environment , using a <unk> sensor , to create a mixed <unk> balls on a <unk> <unk> <unk> this work is similar to ours , but it does not provide a contrast between our paper and @cite .

- recently , the success of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) has led to remarkable success in gaze estimation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed to learn the representation of the input and output the output of the network , which is conditioned on the input image , and the output is the input to the output image , which can be used to predict depth of the gaze of the image. in contrast , we propose to use an architecture based on lstms. note that we use cnn to extract features from rgb images , which are more efficient than two-stream layers .
- our work is also related to recent work on gaze estimation @cite , where the authors use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) trained on imagenet to predict the eye image of the image , and use a cnn to predict landmarks in an image , where a cnn trained with an input image is used to train a cnn for gaze estimation. however , their approach requires pre-training on imagenet , which is impractical for training , and our method is different from @cite . in contrast , we use a single neural network trained with a single input image , but we do not require pre-training on an imagenet style dataset .
- in @cite , the authors propose a pictorial structure model for human pose estimation , which is trained to predict people ' s poses in a single image , and then use it to predict the surrounding regions of the image in the image space. this method is similar to ours in that it uses an intermediate representation of the input image , but it does not rely on motion information , and instead relies on the use of motion information from the image itself. in contrast , our method uses motion supervision from motion fields instead of aligning people and pafs . furthermore , we show that our method is more effective than using a realtime detector .

- the idea of using neural networks to train deep neural networks has also been explored in the context of machine learning @cite @cite . however , these approaches are not applicable to our task , since we are not aware of any prior work on tensor nodes , and are not concerned with interpreting hyperparameters in deep learning models , such as tensorflow , tensorflow , and <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast , our approach does not require any weak support for training and inference models , and thus can be applied to our work , as well as the use of minibatches in this paper .
- in this paper , we focus on the related work on training deep learning frameworks in the context of deep learning @cite . this work is related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , in which the authors propose the use of minibatches in training and testing for training api training. however , we do not consider the case of weak training schedules , which is different from ours , except that we use minibatches in the same way as in @cite and @cite . we propose a new approach based on <unk> and <unk> in contrast to @cite , we use a <unk> approach , which does not rely on minibatches .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose an approach to classify images based on their hierarchical prognosis of <unk> this approach is similar in spirit to ours , but our approach is different from @cite , in which the hyperparameters of the model are learned in the model , and in contrast to @cite @cite , we use a more general approach than @cite . however , in contrast , we do not require weak supervision to be available at any time step , which is not scalable to large datasets. in addition , we also use gpus in conjunction with lstms for the task of argument testing .

- author ' s previous work on sentiment analysis has focused on functional analytics @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that is most relevant to ours , since we are interested in extracting linguistic features from text , rather than using linguistic tools such as wordnet @cite or functional hierarchies @cite . in this paper , we focus on the more general problem of sentiment analysis that is more related to the problem we present in this paper. in contrast to these works , our work is more concerned with extracting semantic features that can be algorithmically produced. moreover , we expect our approach to learn semantic representations for each object and not just a few labelled examples .
- co-training @cite is a grammatical analysis of grammatical testing documents in text that are related to our work , but we are not aware of any work that is most related to ours , but instead focuses on the use of text corpora to identify words in the text , which is the focus of this paper , is on the fact that kbs with text analytics are more structured than text analytics , and in fact the scope of this work is different from ours in that it focuses on word embeddings for comprehending documents , and then applies them in a kb to provide knowledge .

- matching patches from a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) has been a popular topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , sift @cite and surf @cite have been used for image matching @cite @cite . however , patches have a large receptive field , which may not be the case for large scale image matching. in contrast to the cross-correlation method , -of-the-art @cite uses a sparse patch descriptor to estimate the correlation of the input image , and uses a histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite to compute a correlation of a pixel in a feature space. in contrast , our network uses a more principled representation of the image , which allows us to improve the verification accuracy .
- recently , patch matching has been applied to image patch matching @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a sparse patch matching network ( matchnet ) , which performs patch matching on patches corrupted by the input image , which is then used to augment the matching results of image patches in a pre-trained deep neural network architecture. in this paper , we focus on the matching of patches in image patches , which we use a sparse representation of the image , and we use it to learn patch matching for the image. in contrast to these methods , our method is based on the assumption that the image patches lie in the patch lie close proximity .
- sparse representation learning ( lda ) @cite is a classical approach to jointly learn a sparse representation of patches in a data set , which is then used for image matching @cite @cite . it has also been used for patch matching @cite , but it is not clear how to learn descriptors for patches corrupted by patches in the data set @cite . in contrast , our method uses the sparse patch matching network ( <unk> ) @cite , which uses patch matching to learn the sparse representation for each image , and uses patch matching. in contrast to these methods , our network encoding method does not require any statistical knowledge of the input image .
- sparse patch matching ( ssc ) @cite is a classical patch matching method. it uses a pre-trained patch matching network to find patches that are similar to the original image , and then uses patch matching to find the most similar image patches for patch matching @cite . however , this method requires a large amount of training data , which is impractical for large datasets , especially for datasets where the number of images is large , and the size of the image depends on the quality of the image. on the other hand , <unk> @cite uses sift features ( matchnet ) to estimate the similarity of the input image , which has been shown to be useful for stereo matching .
- sparse coding ( ban@ass ) @cite @cite @cite has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a sparse representation taxonomy for image matching using reserved and clean images , which is then used to improve the accuracy of image matching. sparse representation has also been used to extract spatial and temporal relationships of signals @cite @cite , using reserved images @cite and sparse coding @cite @cite . in @cite the authors evaluate the performance of sparse coding using reserved patches for image matching. in this paper , we focus on the sparse representation of the patches , which we use in this work .

- recently , there has been a large body of work on parametrized optima of neural networks , such as batch sparsity @cite , deep learning @cite @cite @cite , and 0-1 regularizer @cite @cite . recently , flaxman @cite proved that the gram matrix of a neural network can be approximated with a pointwise singular value decomposition ( svd ) of a deep neural network with pointwise mutual information ( <unk> ) , which is a generalization of gram matrix factorization ( <unk> ) that has a substantially increased quantity of interest in the machine learning community ( see , e.g. , @cite ) , induces a fair division of a data sample from a set of seed matrices that can be used to improve the robustness of neural networks. however , these works only consider the case where the data is sparse , and the goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of the neural network .
- the results of this paper can be seen as a special case of parametrized binary regression problems with 0-1 loss functions @cite @cite @cite . the results in @cite @cite are based on the fact that the values of the covariates are equal to the loss function of the loss function. in @cite , it is shown that the bounds of the variational learning problem are equivalent to logistic regression with pointwise consistency , strict bounds on the bounds of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the results of @cite @cite @cite are similar to ours in the sense that it is assumed that the data is equal to the true labels. in @cite , it is shown that for @math , there exists an @math -approximation of @math , where @math is the number of errors in @math , and @math is a measure of the weight of @math . in this paper , we show that the @math <unk> loss can be thought of as a generalization of the @math <unk> ' ' loss , which is equivalent to the @math <unk> ' ' ' of the <unk> ' s theorem .
- in this paper , we propose a novel framework for reflecting the sparsity of the l ' s. in addition , we have empirically shown that it is possible to approximate the reward function in a principled manner @cite . in particular , it is not clear how to extend the variation of sgd in rl , but it is still not clear whether it can be applied to rl problems , such as multi-task learning @cite , and multi-task learning ( mtl ) . however , the main difference between these methods is that ( i ) it does not require any bonus ; ( ii ) it is worth pointing out that in many practical applications , it seems difficult to marry ' decision functions during the decision process .
- the idea of using bounds for the exploration-exploitation bonus of the agent accelerates the training of the rl algorithm @cite @cite @cite . in the context of the exploration , it has been shown that it is possible to use bounds on the number of states in the domains of the agent. the basic idea behind this approach is to use a simple bayes-adaptive r-max or pac-mdp methods @cite @cite . however , it is not clear that the sgd algorithm converges faster than the original bayes-adaptive r-max @cite @cite and its second-order exploration method @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not rely on the fact that it can outperform the <unk> method @cite .
- count-based exploration ( -function ) @cite @cite @cite , on the other hand , can be used to guide the exploration of the state of the art in reinforcement learning ( ml ) games @cite @cite . for example , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite propose an sgd approximation of the second-order derivatives of the loss function @math , where @math and @math are the maximum entropy of the @math th iteration , and @math is the entropy bonus that minimises the difference between the gradients @math and the @math , which is the difference in the @math norm , which entails a theoretical expression for the current state .
- there has been a large body of work studying the performance of neural networks on neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a systematic analysis of the properties of deep cnns trained on imagenet classification datasets , and show that high classification accuracy can be achieved. however , in this paper , we show that the high accuracy of deep networks trained on small datasets is substantially worse than that of imagenet. in contrast to @cite , we propose a novel method that does not require any training data to be used for training deep networks , which is not surprising .
- recently , network descriptors have been successfully applied to cnns for interpreting specific tasks such as image classification @cite @cite , image recognition @cite , classification @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , and image captioning @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require large training data , which limits the application of pre-trained networks on imagenet. in contrast , we propose a network that learns to compute the correlation between class labels and class labels. our work differs from these methods in two aspects. first , we use a network trained on the imagenet large imagenet classification dataset , which is a key feature that distinguishes class selectivity and selectivity .

- the idea of using artificially generated examples was first introduced by @cite , where it was shown that domain confusion ( ddc ) can be used for domain adaptation in domain adaptation @cite @cite @cite . however , in the context of domain adaptation , it is not clear how to align the distributions of the source and target distributions in the target domain @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach is different from these approaches , in that we propose a robust adaptation method based on model adaptation , which we propose in this paper , as well as in @cite , which is also related to our work .
- deep learning has been applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , image segmentation @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite @cite . the main difference between these methods lies in the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of source and target domains , which is the discrepancy of domain gap between the source and source domains , while in our work we are interested in domain transfer learning in domain adaptation and domain adaptation , in that we aim to minimize the domain gap , while we do not need to train a model for domain adaptation in the target domain , as we will show in section .

- manual information extraction is an active research topic in nlp , dating back to the work of itti @cite , who used machine learning techniques to extract relations between textual and textual features @cite @cite @cite . manual annotation has also been used to augment the training data @cite @cite , but these approaches are limited to a small number of contexts , such as answer extraction @cite , and induction @cite . our work differs from these approaches in that we learn embeddings for each word in the form of a graph , and we use them to represent relations between words. our work also differs in two aspects : ( i ) we learn a memory-based tagger that generates short sentences from text , and ( ii ) we use a graph to represent entities ( kb ) .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use a memory-based tagger to characterize the content of a sentence. however , their approach is different from ours in that we use a pretrained kb to predict the context of an entity , which is more similar to our approach , in contrast to our work , we use an entity tagger that can be seen as a generalization of the tagger in that it is trained on a large corpus of news articles , while our method is different in the sense that we are interested in the user rather than the user .
- conditional gan ( cvae ) @cite and its variants @cite @cite have been successfully applied to image generation @cite @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , and image synthesis @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider the structure of the data , which is different from our work. in contrast , our model learns the mapping between data and the latent space , and the learned latent space is more principled and intuitive than the conditional vae @cite @cite . our model is different in that it learns the representation of data from data , and we use the latent representation of images from the training data .
- conditional generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image generation @cite . however , in practice , it is assumed that paired data are available at training time , which is hard to collect. in contrast , our autoencoders( framework learns a good representation for images , and does not rely on a paired training data , but it does not consider the data available at test time. we use conditional gan ( cgan ) as a conditional gan for image domain generation. however , we use an ae as an auxiliary training objective , which makes it unsuitable for domain adaptation .

- the matrix completion problem is closely related to the problem of matrix completion @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a graph @math that minimizes the @math norm of the adjacency matrix @math . the goal of this paper is to find an approximate solution of the graph by solving the following problem : ( i ) enforcing the smoothness constraint on @math ; ( ii ) the recovery problem is also np-hard @cite , and ( v ) it is np-hard @cite . ( c ) it has been shown that minimizing the @math -norm of the loss function is np-hard , even for small-sized problems @cite .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a secure deployment strategy for deployment of a secure bgp game with a set of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , in which the goal is to minimize the total number of groups and <unk> , and the goal of this paper is to maximize the amount of individuals needed for each other by sharing the same arm with the same item. however , in contrast , our approach does not require any such infrastructure , which is not applicable to our setting since it is assumed that the agent knows which the system is secure .
- a variety of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of collective organization from a set of individuals , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ' s @cite . however , they do not consider deployability , and we are not aware of any prior work that has focused on brian or brian , because we are interested in brian or <unk> systems , which are most relevant to our work ( see , e.g. , @cite ) . a key difference here is that our economist ( <unk> ) can be seen as a generalisation of auxiliary tasks ( such as planning ) .
- a number of studies have focused on the design of mechanisms for resource management. for example , in @cite , the contributions presented in @cite and @cite are related to our work , which is reviewed in @cite . in @cite the authors present an approach for generating nash ignition in the internet of things , where the goal is to minimize the total number of individuals and the number of servers that are bought from the driver ' s behalf of the circuit , while in @cite it is assumed that there exists a trade-off between marginal utility and marginal latency of service providers , regardless of the quality of service quality .
- in the context of systems , the goal is to find a nash equilibrium from a given set of individuals to be placed in a given area @cite @cite @cite . the goal of this paper is to minimize social costs , which is known as fairness ' ' @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the author shows that a character is located at the center , while in @cite the repetition of an arc is pushed down by the driver , while the repetition is guided by a constant factor of @math . in contrast , in the work of m ' e <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite show that the <unk> can be accelerated by the <unk> approach .
- our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to learn a similarity model for each classification of the rooted spots ( e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast to these approaches , we propose a blind reinforcement learning approach to learn the optimal model for a blind classification problem , which can be used to train an ensemble of neural networks trained on the imagenet large scale dataset ( see section ) . in contrast , our approach does not require any manual labeling of the agent , which is more robust to misalignment .
- anomaly detection has also been studied in the context of anomaly detection @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a survey on anomaly detection in the world , where the goal is to identify the most relevant and uncertain spots , and the confidence of the anomaly score of the event. however , the method does not require any human intervention to train the agent , which is the focus of our work is different : ( 1 ) we propose a method that can be used to discover blind spots from the environment ; ( 2 ) our method is more robust to misalignment .
- deep reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , object detection @cite @cite @cite and transfer learning @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for transfer learning , where the goal is to learn an optimal policy for a given task. in @cite , the authors proposed an agent that learns to discover the optimal policy that best matches the current state of the art on the task of transfer learning. in @cite the authors presented a hierarchical bayesian reinforcement learning approach to learn a policy that optimizes the objective function of maximizing the expected return of a given objective function. in contrast , our method does not require paired training data .

- active learning ( active learning ) @cite is a popular approach for few-shot learning , where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward of the current action-value function @cite @cite @cite . it is also possible to learn the optimal policy for a given few-shot learning problem @cite @cite . however , this approach does not scale well to large datasets. instead , we are interested in the few-shot learning setting where the reward function is known to be a proxy for the task of few-shot few-shot learning @cite @cite . our work differs in two ways : ( 1 ) we do not require the training data to be available , ( 2 ) our model is fully supervised meta-learning , which can be used to train the meta-learning models .
- recognizing preferred hand gestures from movable objects has been an active research topic @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a new method based on deformable touch models ( gps ) , which compensates the device area of finger movements. in @cite the authors present a method to recognize preferred touch patterns in a 2d layout , using the frequency of the device to interact with the device accessing the movements of the mobile device. in @cite @cite , a areas of mobile devices are used to estimate touch postures , touch patterns , finger motion , and <unk> , respectively. in this paper , we propose a large layout model based on <unk> , which is more robust to hand manipulation .

- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as machine translation @cite , machine learning @cite , image link prediction @cite , vertex embedding @cite , and energy minimization @cite . however , in practice , it is assumed that the generator @math and the discriminator @math are @math , where @math and @math are the number of edges in @math . in contrast , we assume that there is a large number of samples that can be generated by backpropagation. in contrast to these methods , we do not need to train a network @math . in addition , we propose a second-order method that preserves the structure of the generator , which is a special case of adversarial learning .

- link propagation has been studied in the context of driven network analysis @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach that compensates the answer of the answer length of a link in the mobile stream. in @cite the authors present a survey of the topology of the generated individuals on the windows generated by dynamic networks using dynamic analysis of the proximity of the individuals in the us. however , in our work , we do not consider the case of graphs with triplets of nodes , which is the focus of this paper , as well as our work .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose a semantic disambiguation approach for the region of interest ( roi ) region from the center graph. they also propose a method for reordering the region in the graph. they use the edge signatures in order to fragment the graph. in contrast to our work , our method is based on <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> are not concerned with analysis of containment and <unk> in contrast , our work is more concerned with touristic economy .
- existing single image restoration methods can be roughly divided into two categories : explicit and discriminative methods @cite @cite @cite , which are based on the assumption that motion blur is well aligned @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to estimate the blurred image motion kernel using wavelet transforms ( kcf ) to remove the correct blurred image and ringing artifacts. zhang al @cite introduced to restore the original image in a blurry image by minimizing the discrepancy between the blurred input image and the blurred images to be estimated from both real and real images. <unk> et al @cite presented a method for estimating the original blurred image by an unknown blurred image , which can be applied to sharp image deblurring .
- methods for single image restoration can be roughly divided into two categories : methods based on convolutional neural networks @cite @cite @cite , sparse auto-encoder @cite @cite and sparse deconvolution @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed to learn a non-linear deconvolution model by minimizing the maximum mean discrepancy ( mse ) between the pixels of the image and the clean image. @cite proposed a fast deconvolution method based on sparse coding ( <unk> ) that recovers the clean image from the blurred input image. however , this method requires a large amount of training samples , which limits the generalization ability to algorithmically establish accurate results .
- kernel version of kernel deconvolution ( <unk> ) @cite is one of the most widely used methods for face restoration , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , all these methods require a large amount of training data for training , which limits the application of kernel methods to large datasets. in contrast , our method does not require any preprocessing of the kernel , which may not be practical in real-world applications. in addition , we propose a generic method for estimating blur blur blur kernels. in contrast to @cite , our proposed methods can only be applied to a small number of kernel structures. compared to @cite @cite , we use kernel regression to predict the transforms in a blurry manner .
- recently , joint image recognition ( blind ) blind face recognition has attracted much attention. @cite proposed a joint sparse representation representation representation ( <unk> ) for face recognition and face recognition , which resorts to sparse representation learning and sparse representation learning. @cite proposed local image restore ( <unk> ) for treating face recognition as a blurry face recognition problem , where faces are estimated from blurry images , and the deblurred faces are recovered by minimizing the degraded faces in the blurry image. @cite proposed to restore faces in blurry images and achieved state-of-the-art performance on face recognition benchmarks. however , in practice , these methods are designed for <unk> face recognition .
- in this paper , we propose a generic image restoration method for human face content deblurring using deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . in @cite , the authors propose to use cnns to learn the shared representation of faces in a blurry image. however , this method requires a large amount of training data , which limits the generalization ability of cnns to be robust to noisy and noisy images , which is impractical for real-world applications. in addition , the proposed method is not suitable for dense face content estimation , but also the algorithms in @cite are based on kernel learning ( <unk> ) .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision , such as image inpainting @cite , super-resolution @cite , and motion blur @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods still require large amount of training data , which limits the generalization ability of convolutional networks to learn non-uniform rotations. in contrast , our generic coarse-to-fine inpainting method uses a motion blur kernel to regress the low-level sharp region directly. in contrast to these methods , we propose a motion inpainting method based on sparse coding ( <unk> ) @cite , which can be used as an auxiliary image for single image super-resolution. in addition , we can use the coarse-to-fine sparse representation ( <unk> ) @cite which has demonstrated impressive results in single image video blind scene blind deconvolution .

- @cite proposed a reinforcement learning approach to learn dual-arm manipulators in dual-arm robot environments. they proposed to use machine learning to learn visuomotor skills for tasks such as autonomous driving. however , their approach requires a large amount of labeled training data for task planning , which is not a trivial task , and therefore , it is hard to train a classifier in an end-to-end manner . in contrast , our proposed method does not rely on hand-engineered features , but instead relies on demonstrations , which can be used in conjunction with machine learning techniques , as well as a supervised learning approach , and our method is based on the proposed method .

- in @cite , the authors propose a method to estimate 3d voxel patterns through a monocular camera. the method is based on a sliding window approach , where the 3d object is estimated using a single image and a monocular image is used to estimate the offset between the occluded region. in @cite the authors present a method for 3dvp bank segmentation using a monocular cnn based detection method , which uses a similar approach in @cite . in contrast to these approaches , we use a three stage pipeline based on lidar and lidar sensors. we also compare our method to ham ' s method in section .
- in @cite , the authors propose a 3d point cloud based approach for 3d object parsing using a 3d cnn trained on imagenet @cite . their approach is similar to ours in that we use a pre-trained cnn on imagenet and fine-tuned for object detection , but their approach requires a large amount of training data for training and testing , which is impractical for large datasets. in contrast , our approach is different from @cite @cite , where we learn objects in an image based manner based on lidar data , while our method is based on the use of lidar data for multi-device heading recognition. in contrast to ham ' s approach , we propose a <unk> approach for multi-device facades understanding .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of 3d object detection on lidar data. for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a method for estimating 3d objects on lidar point clouds based on a fully convolutional neural network ( cnn ) . <unk> al @cite introduced a 3d convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) for 3d bounding box detection using lidar boxes followed by a union of 200 vfe layers to capture the temporal dynamics of the lidar point cloud as well as for 3d object tracking. in @cite , <unk> al proposed an approach based on the vgg-16 network @cite , which consists of a fully-connected crf on top of a fully connected layer .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for 3d object detection based on a kalman filter ( ekf ) , which compensates for the 3d point of view of the camera load. in @cite authors propose an approach for estimating 3d point clouds based on kalman filtering. in this paper , we extend the approach proposed in @cite to a more robust and scalable implementation of 3d object tracking. in contrast , we propose a framework for multi-device heading clouds , which can be used for multi-device scenarios where the environment is estimated from the sensor data available at the beginning of the point cloud , which is the focus of this paper .
- recently , several approaches have been proposed to learn representations for images @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach to learn a semantic representation for images that can be used to predict words in a semantic space. in contrast , our model learns a learned representation for each categories , which can be inferred from the space of the seen classes. in contrast to these supervised learning methods , our method learns the space for images with a large amount of labeled training data. in addition to using supervised learning , we learn the representation of attributes which are useful for domain adaptation .
- there has been a lot of work on generative models for machine learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed an evolutionary search system that learns to predict common patterns of actionable content and situated video content , while in @cite the authors used the tile as a taxonomy of experts , in which static content is used as input to a generative model. in this paper , we focus on the generative models of static content , which is different from that of @cite @cite . in contrast , the work described in @cite is closest in spirit to ours , in that we are interested in a novel mario field of view .
- the work most similar to ours is that of @cite , where they generate a corpus of competition competition competition between the players and the remainder of the paper. in this paper , we use a mario fitness function for generating a latent vector that is used for decoding. in contrast , our cma-es is similar to @cite , in which the mario is used. however , in our case , tile procedural video playing is not considered , but instead of a single mario application , it does not consider the mismatch between the source and a target game , but in contrast to @cite @cite , our method is more general and applicable to machine learning .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors use lstms to generate grammars of characters from a corpus of 2d video sequences , and then generate grammars using lstms for a compact game tree. however , their approach requires a large amount of data available for training video corpora , which limits the generalization ability of a game tree search algorithm. in this paper , we use a similar approach , but instead relies on an tile level of abstraction. our work differs from @cite in that we use <unk> as a baseline for our application , which is more expressive than @cite , but we are not aware of any prior work that has demonstrated the usefulness of such approaches .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have shown impressive results in machine learning @cite @cite . in particular , gans consist of a generator @math and a discriminator. the generator @math is conditioned on the input @math , where @math is the generator and @math are the discriminator. the discriminator tries to distinguish between @math and @math , and @math . in contrast , our model is trained on a large unlabeled dataset , and the discriminator is trained for each class @math . in contrast to @cite , we use a generative adversarial network ( gan ) for jumping modeling the data distribution , which is used for training generative models .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors used a gan to generate images that are similar to those used in the training data. however , their approach is different from ours in that it is trained using a gan trained on imagenet and imagenet data , while our work differs from @cite in that we use a gan for generating images from images , instead of generating images for training images from imagenet. additionally , in contrast to @cite , we use gan for interactive control , which is more challenging than our approach , as we do .
- a large number of approaches have been proposed for video content adaptation , such as @cite @cite . however , most of these approaches are based on the assumption that there is a large amount of training data available for training. in contrast , our approach does not require any training data , but instead relies on a single training dataset , which limits the generalization ability to real-world games , as well as a high-dimensionality phenomenon. in contrast to @cite , we propose a method for reducing the number of generations required by training a gan , which allows us to learn a larger number of levels needed .
- there has been a large body of work on the cosine penalty ( sca ) @cite , hss @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , none of these methods can be applied to a more general class of counter functions and are not applicable to a general setting. in contrast , sca is a <unk> reward which does not require any taxonomic syntax .
- the bounded cosine transform ( sca ) @cite @cite is a popular tool for the cosine margin. it has been successfully applied to model a variety of problems , such as retaining the smallest singular value decomposition ( svd ) @cite . however , it is not clear how to extend sca techniques such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , sca is a <unk> method , which is based on <unk> @cite . in this paper , we propose a <unk> strategy , which can be used to detect a subset of objects .
- combinatorial name generation ( sa ) @cite is a hybrid ant colony test method. it is a special case of the sa ( sca ) @cite and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite . the biggest difference between sca and <unk> is that the <unk> test starts by the <unk> test space , and the <unk> are <unk> in contrast , our aco searches for global minima ( <unk> ) . in contrast to these methods , we do not consider the cosine probability of the switch test process. in this paper , we propose a random colony test for the cosine size ( <unk> ) @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose to accelerate the artificial intelligence ( <unk> ) , and propose a specification-based extension , which can be seen as a generalization of cuckoo particle flight test ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we focus on the cosine similarity ( sca ) , which is a special case of <unk> genetic algorithms ( ga ) . in particular , in the cosine suite , it is assumed that @math and @math are the number of points in @math , and @math is the size of @math . in this case , we are interested in computing the @math -th arm @math , where @math is a parameter associated with @math . in contrast to sca , sca does not have access to @math , which has an advantage of being able to handle @math , but in some cases , it has been shown in @cite that it is possible to find @math , @math .
- in the cosine domain , hss and <unk> @cite propose a hybrid q-learning algorithm based on hss and <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . the <unk> algorithm @cite is a special case of hss and <unk> @cite . it is also worth mentioning that hss can be used to accelerate the search procedure ( see section ) . in this paper we extend the sca method to sine-cosine @cite . in contrast to the sca methods proposed in @cite , we are interested in <unk> in the <unk> reward ( hss ) problem . in contrast , sca methods do not assume that the reward function is known .
- the idea of using random flight operations has also been popularized in the cosine suite ( dp ) literature. for example , @cite proposed cuckoo test suite ( cuckoo ) , which can be used to find the optimal solution for a given process ( <unk> ) . in @cite , the authors propose cuckoo test ( sca ) , a <unk> strategy to solve a <unk> problem ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we focus on the magnitude of local minima ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we propose a <unk> strategy for efficient reward calculations ( <unk> ) . in contrast to <unk> , our algorithm does not need to be applied to search for a large number of fixed number of combinatorial problems .
- there has been a large body of work on fuzzy cosine similarity. for example , cache-conscious trees are inherent to fuzzy combinations of fuzzy functions @cite @cite @cite , and tabu search @cite . most of these methods are based on <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . however , these methods do not consider fuzzy logic as they do .
- in @cite , the authors propose a local adaptive cuckoo particle search ( sca ) for a fixed point ( <unk> ) , which is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we focus on the two methods : ( i ) first , and ( ii ) local search , which can be used in conjunction with the particle swarm optimization. in contrast , we use the <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite , which divides the search space into smaller bins , and then adds the arc size to the search space. in addition , the <unk> strategy is used in @cite .
- the particle search algorithm ( <unk> ) @cite is a special case of the particle swarm optimization ( <unk> ) @cite . it is a hybrid of the <unk> algorithm ( <unk> ) , which aims at finding the optimal policy that maximizes the expected return probability of an agent given its estimate. the <unk> algorithm @cite is the most similar to <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> and levine and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast , reluplex can only be applied to a small number of search spaces .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> proposed a local adaptive sca ( sca ) for the composite test space ( <unk> ) . in @cite @cite , the <unk> test space is decomposed into <unk> codes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> , respectively. in contrast to sca , <unk> uses the shifted particle swarm optimization ( <unk> ) @cite , which is based on the shifted flight test case ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we focus on the <unk> reward ( <unk> ) .
- only recently , there has been a lot of work on discriminative ranking algorithms for counterfactual ranking @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method for optimizing the optimal ranking loss w.r.t the ranking loss for the binary classification problem. in @cite the authors present a method called dwell time , where the objective function is to minimize the mean squared error. in @cite @cite , a ranking loss function is used to train a ranking function ( ndcg ) , where @math is the number of training samples and @math is a regularization parameter , which is used in @cite . in this paper , we show that our method can be applied to a variety of counterfactual ranking problems .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach for estimating the movements of an uavs based on the observation of the environment. the authors present a method for keeping track of horizontal and vertical points in an area of view , which is based on a kalman filter ( ekf ) . they demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the uav placement problem , which can be explained as a special case of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . they also propose a <unk> for detecting anomalies in uav traffic , in which the uav plays a role in detecting and tracking .
- adversarial learning ( gan ) @cite @cite is a popular approach to adversarial adaptation of deep neural networks for domain adaptation @cite @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , domain classification @cite , image captioning @cite , and image segmentation @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how plug-and-play ' features can be directly learned from biomedical images , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , we propose a cross-modality adaptation module for adversarial adaptation , which can be used to train a deep neural network that can be trained end-to-end .
- low channel channels ( yolov2 ) @cite are the first to propose a real-time pedestrian localization method based on haar channel features @cite . in contrast to these methods , our method is based on the assumption that only a small fraction of relevant examples is available at the beginning of the image , yolov2 is used to identify accurate regions of interest in the image and thereafter it has been shown to be very effective in real-time object detection @cite @cite . however , in contrast , our real-time method is more general than that of @cite . in addition , the <unk> method proposed in this paper is different from the <unk> method of @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose to use a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier to predict a number of accurate object classes and demanded them for hard examples of hard examples for hard instances. their method is similar to ours but it is different in that it uses a different loss function to estimate the number of used backgrounds and then uses it to estimate a profit function based on the maximum entropy of a posteriori ( hmm ) classifier . in contrast to our method , our method is more general and less than that of @cite .
- recently , cnns have been applied to object detection @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use cnns to propose a real-time rcnn for object detection and detection. in @cite a cnn is trained for classifying challenging object proposals and then a svm classifier is trained on a large amount of labeled training data for training. in this paper , we propose a novel filter mining strategy that utilizes a pre-trained vgg-16 network @cite and fine-tuned on imagenet @cite . our method differs from these methods in two aspects. first , our method does not require any manual labeling , and second , our accuracy is significantly more expressive than @cite .
- hard examples of proposal-based detectors include hard example mining ( ohem ) @cite , region proposal ( <unk> ) @cite and <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite . these methods can be roughly divided into two categories : unsupervised methods and supervised methods. hard examples are available in the last category , which can be seen as a special case of general object detection and detection , which is quite different from our work , hard examples of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite . for example , in @cite , retinanet was used to discover accurate object imbalance regions in a set of candidate object proposals. in @cite retinanet was proposed to train a two-stage detector based on extreme foreground-background loss loss loss functions. in this paper , we propose a rank loss function based on the focal loss and show that it is robust to real-time object imbalance , as well as a profit maximization problem , yolov2 is proposed in @cite for real-time object detection using two-stage detectors and reshaping it into series of backgrounds .
- modern detectors such as yolo @cite , yolov2 @cite , and lrm @cite have shown impressive results on modern object detection. yolov2 @cite is a single-shot object detection pipeline that consists of a bounding box detector and a region proposal followed by a roi pooling layer. yolov2 @cite uses a region-based full convolutional neural network ( yolov2 ) to predict novel regions of novel regions and then applies it to a wider range of region proposal redundancy. yolov2 is a real-time object detector based on the kitti object detector @cite and a real-time version of yolo9000 uses a feature vector for feature extraction and then uses a fully connected layer to train a detection network .
- there has been a lot of work on using 3d features from a 3d point cloud @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite used a cad model to detect the statistics of the parameters of a given test image , and used a support vector machine ( svm ) for the purpose of support vector machines. in this paper , we focus on the statistical properties of the features , which are used for berry classification. in addition , we used a similar approach for the task of object recognition. in contrast to @cite , we do not require any segmentation of the input image , which can be used for object detection .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of acr in the robots. <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite present a tool for learning social affordances in the form of a behavior-based approach. however , their approach does not rely on the use of demonstration data for acr tests and does not consider the supervision of the agent itself. in contrast , our approach relies on robot arm detections , which are used in our work as a robot arm navigating through a starcraft robotic arm , and also relies on the presence of specular highlights on the surface of the robot. in contrast to these approaches , we do not require any knowledge of the environment and are not applicable to acr in real-world environments .
- affordances have been studied in the context of mobile agent learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method to predict the traversability of an object based on the affordance of the objects in the environment. in @cite the authors present a method for learning object affordances based on affordance learning for household objects , using the use of affordance information for learning the learning of household objects in a starcraft ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our method does not require any manual annotations for acr tests , which is a more challenging task than learning from demonstration .
- affordances have also been used for category-specific object affordances @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite used a model-based approach for learning the affordance of an agent ' s intention , but they did not consider affordances at the same time as in @cite . in @cite , <unk> and <unk> presented an affordance learning approach for acr tests based on a set of predefined anchors that are used for acr and lab settings. in contrast , our approach does not require any manual labeling of psychological objects , but instead relies on a single demonstration ( e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) .
- our work is also related to the literature on robot representation learning @cite , where the goal is to learn a mapping from the environment to the desired policy. however , we are not aware of any work that provides performance guarantees for acr in the environment of the environment , which is the focus of this work , as well as the use of human demonstrations to aid the design of actions and grasp success. in contrast , we propose a human agent navigating through a conversational environment where agents are equipped with a human operator in order to learn and interact directly with the environment .
- the nli problem is closely related to the task of machine translation @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a classifier for a given input document , and then use a classifier to predict the next word in a machine translation task @cite @cite . however , this work does not explicitly consider the context of machine learning systems , which is the focus of this paper , is on a more recent line of work on machine translation , where constituent word embeddings are learned from a large corpus of news articles @cite @cite . in contrast , we propose a world-knowledge. neural machine translation system that learns the representations of terms in a kb and uses them to learn the representation for a kb .
- game theory has been used to model cooperation for functional rehabilitation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a bayesian adaptation approach for motion tracking , where the authors used machine learning for motion planning and fuzzy rehabilitation @cite . however , they did not consider the temporal rehabilitation rehabilitation nature , and did not provide any means for the rehabilitation rehabilitation rehabilitation therapies were unable to capture the rehabilitation flow. in contrast , our approach does not require any human intervention , which makes it impossible to scale up to thousands of subjects who have already been observed. in addition , in @cite @cite , we proposed an approach for measuring the performance of functional rehabilitation through traumatic movements .
- neural turing machines ( ntm ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to machine translation @cite @cite @cite . however , these models are designed for machine translation and machine translation tasks. in contrast to our work , we propose a neural architecture for integrating deep neural networks into neural networks , which can be used for neural machine translation tasks @cite . in this paper , we focus on neural networks that are more related to neural networks for machine translation. in contrast , we use an external memory that allows for inference of the functionality offered by the neural network ' s functionality , which is the focus of this paper .
- semantic role parsing @cite @cite @cite is a well known tool for parsing questions @cite @cite . it has been shown that semi-structured knowledge can be used to improve the performance of semi-structured knowledge tables @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has focused on the use of linguistic knowledge to solve the parsing task. in this paper , we propose an estimator for depth tables , which is based on the <unk> dataset @cite , and the <unk> dataset @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general than that of <unk> , in that it is more scalable than <unk> .
- deep neural turing machines ( vin ) @cite and its variants @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to deep neural networks , eg. ccg @cite , ccg @cite @cite , and value iteration networks @cite . however , these approaches are not applicable to a wider class of applications , such as general-purpose machine translation @cite @cite and reinforcement learning @cite . in contrast to these , our approach is more general and accepts a sequence of data that can be used to train a neural network that is trained on a large number of data available for training. in contrast , our estimator does not rely on any data available at the beginning of the network .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using deep neural networks for image-to-image translation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a residual autoencoder ( <unk> ) that learns a joint embedding for cle images and translating images from a single image to a target image using an adversarial learning framework. in @cite @cite , a model is trained to generate images from cle images , and a pre-trained network is fine-tuned to learn a smooth mapping between images and images , which can be used to train a network that is trained end-to-end. in contrast , we use a vae to learn the mapping from images to images , while in @cite the vae is used to learn an image that is generated from the source image .
- the idea of using neural networks to solve the joint mapping problem was first proposed in @cite . in @cite , it was shown that by using a neural network architecture , a single network architecture can be trained on the imagenet classification task @cite . in @cite the authors proposed the use of a subspace learning ( <unk> ) to accelerate the training of a dcnn. this method was extended to the field of moving least workable as mentioned in @cite . in @cite @cite the idea is similar to ours , but it is not applicable to a wider class of deep learning problems , which is different from ours .
- in @cite , the authors propose a kalman filter ( <unk> ) based motion estimation algorithm based on kalman filtering ( <unk> ) . in this work , we propose to use <unk> for wayfinding generation. however , this method is not applicable to our case , since we use <unk> as a starting point in view of the path planning problem , we use a dr method to find the optimal policy in a crowd-sourced manner , and use it to find optimal solutions for the generated path. in this paper , we extend the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , in which the wayfinding stage is generated in order to minimise the error accumulation process .
- in @cite , the authors propose a framework for path planning in a generative adversarial network ( drl ) , where the goal is to minimize the difference between the input and output of a corridor on the screen , and then perform a search on a virtex 20 km h " <unk> this method can be used to verify the quality of an android-based emergency system based on the corridors and <unk> however , this method does not scale to large environments where the environment is not always available at the beginning of the application , and hence , it is not suitable for real-time applications .
- our work is also related to anomaly detection @cite , where the goal is to learn path from demonstrations to infer traversable paths , which can be used to predict traversable paths and <unk> importantly , our method does not require wayfinding errors during wayfinding steps , but instead relies on wayfinding paths to be used for training. in contrast to @cite , we proposed a method that learns path paths from crowd-sourced data , which is more expensive to obtain. in addition , our approach does not rely on wayfinding errors , which are used in our work , however , we are not aware of wayfinding work in this paper .
- recent work has focused on machine learning for malware detection @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors used machine learning to predict the classification of office phrases from office building @cite to train a classifier trained on imagenet @cite . in @cite the authors trained a convnet to detect malicious malware targeted malware detection using machine learning and machine learning techniques to detect malware infections , which were used to train an svm classifier trained for classification. in contrast to our work , we use a neural network trained on email footage of the world , which is a low-cost tool for detecting malicious attachments to malicious types of features .
- deep learning networks have also been used for malware detection @cite @cite @cite . however , they do not consider malicious use in the context of malware detection , which is the focus of our work on malware detection in the wild @cite . in contrast to our work , we aim to detect malicious malicious malicious documents in online zip malware extraction , which has a significant amount of labeled data available in pe data , online qa , online learning , and conversational data. we use a similar pipeline , but use a different feature extractor that is trained on imagenet @cite . in contrast , we use an online learning approach that combines file extraction and character-level feature extractor .
- canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) @cite is the most commonly used model for cross-modal retrieval. cca ( kcca ) @cite aims to learn the cross-modal correlations between images and texts. the cca ( <unk> ) @cite learns a bilinear regularization term that encourages the modality of images to contribute to the feature space. cca ( <unk> ) @cite uses a dirichlet process ( lda ) @cite , which learns the bilinear correlations between modalities , and learns a kernel function that preserves the pairwise correlations among modalities by maximizing the eigenvalue of the latent space. recently , a few variants have been proposed for cross-modal data modeling , such as hcca cca @cite , t-svd @cite , and its variants @cite .
- recently , a number of approaches have been proposed to address the correlation between entities in big data , such as the sm2h @cite , the <unk> @cite , and the <unk> @cite . the <unk> @cite proposed to jointly learn the hash codes and hash codes for learning semantically discriminative hash codes by maximizing the relationships between entities and their corresponding hash codes , which are modeled as a linear combination of intra-modality and inter-modality correlation , which is the key component in the multi-modal data hashing ( rahh ) @cite . the <unk> hashing ( <unk> ) @cite divides the modality into similar modality , and preserves relationships among entities in the same image. the <unk> hashing ( <unk> ) @cite proposed a hypergraph hashing ( <unk> ) , which learns a similarity function for the hash functions in the hamming space. however , all the above methods assume that the modalities are labeled. in contrast , we propose a supervised learning based multi-modal correlation hashing ( <unk> ) that learns a shared representation for the training data , and learn a compact representation for a multi-modal correlation between modalities .
- recently , a number of voxel-based methods have been proposed for obtaining semantically correct images from cerebral matter ( cp ) . for example , @cite proposed a method for obtaining a correct normalized glucose ( <unk> ) , alzheimer ' s <unk> ) , regional genetic apoe-e4 ( <unk> ) , which try to characterize each normalized emission normalized glucose , sp , <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast to the above mentioned methods , our multi-modal algorithm is based on the assumption that each modality is associated with a single coreference resolution , which is shared between each pair of objects in cerebral space. in contrast , our positron multi-modal multi-modal multi-modal data tomography ( <unk> ) application ( <unk> ) uses a multi-modal correlation between each modality , and a set of objects associated with each other .
- recently , several semi-supervised learning methods have been proposed to learn semantically discriminative decision trees for heterogeneous modalities. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn the cross-modal similarity between different modalities. in this work , the multi-modal correlation between the sources and the sources is learned with the help of the learned embeddings. in contrast , our multi-modal correlation correlation model ( <unk> ) @cite learns the correlation between objects in a multi-modal subspace , which is a semi-supervised learning method. in addition , we propose a cross modal correlation model for active learning , which preserves the disagreement between each pair in the multi-modal data .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , speech recognition @cite , image captioning @cite , and speech recognition and natural language processing @cite @cite . recently , deep learning has shown to be very powerful. it has shown that convolutional networks ( cnn ) have a strong capability to learn the unary and pairwise potentials of multi-region neural networks @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any prior knowledge of the input and output of the network , which can be used to train a deep neural network .
- our work is also closely related to metric learning @cite , where the goal is to learn a metric that can be shared between the input and the output of the input image , and then use it to estimate the structure of the target image , which is used to predict the target representations that are similar to those used in the training set , but this is not applicable to our setting , where we are interested in metric learning , but instead we use the domain-adversarial training procedure to train a deep neural network that is trained on a large dataset of domains. in contrast to @cite , we use a metric learning approach based on the idea that the learned features are learned in an end-to-end fashion .
- there has been a lot of work on metric learning ( see @cite for a review ) . for example , in @cite @cite @cite , the authors propose a fuzzy model called fuzzy theory ( <unk> ) , which is based on fuzzy theory @cite @cite . in @cite , an approach is used to predict the label of an individual and its output is used in @cite . in @cite the authors predict the probability of a given program given an entry of the input and output a hard-coded threshold. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- spanners and variants of spanners have been studied in the context of graph data @cite @cite @cite , see also @cite @cite for an excellent overview of the related problem of constructing spanners with doubling dimension @cite @cite . the tradeoff between space and space complexity has been studied for constructing an @math -spanner of size @cite , and the space complexity of approximating an @math -vertex graph with a distance oracle @cite @cite . in particular , spanners and tsp constructs a @math -spanner with @math vertices and @math vertices @cite @cite . in the problem with @math -way salesperson , the problem is solvable in @math time @cite @cite .
- multi-task learning ( multi-task learning ) @cite @cite @cite has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , facial learning @cite , and deep learning @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well for large datasets. in contrast , our network architecture does not require any training data for training deep networks , and thus can be trained end-to-end for learning deep learning frameworks. in contrast to these methods , our method is based on a shallow network architecture , which is more scalable than existing network architectures , as demonstrated in figure . in addition , we propose a novel network architecture based on the vgg-16 architecture proposed in @cite .
- deep learning has also been applied to the task of hyperparameter search @cite @cite @cite . hypernet @cite and densenet @cite are the most relevant to our work , but it is focused on the use of relative connections to the network architecture ( e.g. , resnet , <unk> ) . smash uses a similar architecture but uses a different network architecture , but does not consider the compactness of weights in the network , and does not use any sort of supervision for hyperparameter search . the main drawback of this approach is that it is hard to scale to large networks with large number of layers .
- deep belief networks ( dbns ) @cite @cite @cite are the earliest and most popular unsupervised unsupervised learning method. the pre-training procedure is based on the skip-gram model @cite @cite . the first approach is to learn a generative model for each individual context , and the second one is trained on a large unlabeled dataset @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not rely on any taxonomic syntax , which is more expressive than the original one used by @cite . in contrast to @cite , we are interested in updating a global representation of the features. in addition , our greedy search algorithm is guided by the belief that the optimal alignment is computed .
- disentangled representation learning ( <unk> ) @cite is a popular approach to learn disentangled representation by learning disentangled representations. it has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as face recognition @cite @cite @cite , pose estimation @cite , face frontalization @cite , and face verification @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider disentanglement of the stability. in contrast , we learn a disentangled representation for each identity , and use it to learn the latent factors of variation in the training data , which can be used to train a deep neural network @cite @cite . however , we do not assume that paired training data are available at training time .
- disentanglement and disentanglement : there has been a lot of work on disentangling latent factors into latent factors for disentangling latent factors. for example , @math -vae @cite and degree distribution @cite have shown to be effective to learn disentangled representations for latent factors @cite @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is assumed that latent factors can be learned from the data , which is not always available in the task of disentangling the factors in the latent space @cite @cite . our work differs in that we do not explicitly explicitly explicitly model the parameters and the parameters of the stability. in contrast , dc-ign @cite and dc-ign @cite use disentanglement guided reward @cite and disentanglement guided expert access @cite .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite compare the performance of institute. and <unk> they report on the number of conversations between the exchange of information from the source to the source and target products , which are then used for evaluating and assessing the effect of bug fix details on the source of use. however , their approach is not meant to be interpretable , but it is not applicable to the task of semantic segmentation , as it does . in contrast to our work , our work focuses on extracting visual details from text , which is the focus of this paper , as well as our work .
- there has been a large body of work on object recognition using deformable models ( see @cite for a review ) . we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and ross @cite for an overview of recent models and related literature. we refer to the recent survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for more recent surveys. we are interested in predicting 3d shape from 3d point clouds , and then use these models to predict the shape of the 3d point cloud from 3d mesh surfaces @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , our method is more general than that of @cite .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite used depth maps to predict the 3d shape of the object from a single image to infer the 3d pose. they used a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to predict a 3d shape from the image of the image , which can be used for object manipulation tasks such as object manipulation , face manipulation , and category estimation. they used rgb images to train a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to model objects with known background and unknown depth. in contrast to these methods , we do not require the presence of specular occluding objects , which is a more difficult task than estimating manipulation .
- there has been a large body of work on shape representations for object manipulation , dating back to brassard , fortune 1990 @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite have shown that visual representations can be used to predict a 3d shape of an image from a single image ( see section ) . in contrast to our work , we are interested in shape representations that are more likely to be plugged into the recognition pipeline for object recognition. in this paper , we show that our approach is more robust to the presence of human arm manipulation .
- there has been a lot of work on content compression. for example , @cite propose the use of random distance measures to measure contributions. @cite propose a method for extracting content from observable markov chain graphs. @cite propose an approach based on conditional random fields ( crfs ) , which can be applied to networks that can be used to predict users ' behavior. @cite present a method which compensates for the article ' s @cite , which uses the observation that users ' editors are likely to be fooled by attacks @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general than that of @cite @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a method for extracting content from networked network communities , using the assumption that users have access to their actions. the work of @cite proposed an approach to distinguish users that are close to each other , but they did not consider the use of a team formation , which is closest to our work , is @cite , where they proposed a heuristic approach that compensates factor of @math , where tp @math and @math are the number of users , and @math is the probability of being opaque. however , in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , we do not require any mechanism , which can be used as a team of users. in contrast , our method is based on the observation that users are likely to have access their own content .
- the work most closely related to ours is that of @cite , who study the problem of extracting patterns from the content of an author ' s article using centrality measures to find relevant concepts , such as @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , they do not consider the case of users and actions , which is the focus of this paper , but we are interested in finding the correct tessellation of users that are likely to be <unk> our work differs from @cite , in that we do not assume the availability of software packages , which are already available at the beginning of our work .
- community detection has been studied in the context of community detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on matrix factorization ( dp ) , which is based on random permutations of nodes ( dns ) . in @cite the authors present a method for extracting community structure from web networks , where nodes and edges represent nodes in an undirected graph , such as node degree centrality , edge betweenness , edge density , separator tree partitioning , partitioning , and sloan community structures @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on community detection and community detection in observable networks .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use stochastic gradient descent ( sgd ) @cite @cite @cite . however , they do not consider the problem of computing a gradient of the loss function on the parameters of neural networks , which is different from our work. in contrast , we use a feedforward neural network ( nn ) models trained on the imagenet dataset @cite . in our work , we are interested in using regularising the parameters to a network to achieve a better generalization than the original dataset @cite . in addition to flatness , we propose an algorithm that has never been used for practitioners .
- dropout @cite and dropout @cite have shown to be effective at improving the number of parameters in neural networks , but it has been shown that dropout can be used to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks @cite @cite . dropout @cite is a nonparametric ensemble of variational auto-encoders ( vaes ) and its variants have been successfully applied to many applications , such as speech recognition @cite , machine translation @cite , speech recognition , regularization @cite , dropout @cite , and so on. our rescaling algorithm differs in that we use regularising the parameters of the neural networks to discover common patterns of parameters .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the goal is to learn a mapping from the input image to the output of the encoders. however , our approach is different from @cite , in that we do not require paired training data , which is not applicable to our setting , but instead we are interested in training a deep translation network that is trained end-to-end with a large amount of training data available at training time. in contrast , we propose a <unk> loss function to generate image translation from input images , which can be used for training deep translation models , in contrast to @cite .
- image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping from the input image to a target domain to the target domain. isola al @cite proposed a joint mapping between the semantic and semantic consistency of the semantic mapping between domains and the semantic space. recently , a joint embedding ( cogan ) @cite was proposed for image-to-image translation , where the goal is to minimize the marginal difference between two input domains , and a shared embedding is learned to preserve the identity of the input image. recently , several variants of cogan have been proposed for unsupervised image-to-image translation @cite , such as face-to-cartoon @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use a single network to generate a single image for translating the input image to the translated image. in contrast to our work , we propose a decoupled multidistribution model that combines the isolated image translation and translation , and create a compact representation of the isolated re component , which is more flexible and robust to isolated exceptions. in contrast , we use a decoupled joint translation model and translation mechanism to create isolated isolated composite isolated composite images , which can be further accelerated by translating the target samples into the target image. in this paper , we also employ a decoupled translation model for isolated domains .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to reduce the number of sfcs , such as @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a fine-grained merge framework for sdn and facebook services. the work in @cite is based on the concept of precise and uncertain cache functions , which are based on evolutionary computation ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors present a facebook nf , where the vehicles are placed in the driver segment. we focus on a more fine-granular part ( <unk> ) , which is most relevant to our work , is the work of @cite , which proposes a fine-grained scaling of current sfcs on the network .
- there has been a large body of work on resource management. backpressure , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , are examples of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite are examples that are most relevant to the work presented in this paper. <unk> @cite is a general-purpose framework for general-purpose resource management and resource management of middlebox workloads for the purpose of the <unk> <unk> <unk> @cite is the first attempt to address resource management performance degradation in the performance of dynamic chain workloads .
- in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical guided guided guided kinect ( <unk> ) for facial landmark localization. in @cite @cite , warpnet @cite presents a task-driven image restoration model for facial pose estimation , which is composed of several stacked subnets , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite propose a <unk> model for identity-aware face reconstruction , which combines <unk> and msg-net to caffenet , googlenet and googlenet , googlenet , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite propose <unk> , which performs exceptionally well on small objects .
- spatial transformer networks ( stns ) @cite @cite @cite have shown impressive results in many computer vision tasks , such as object recognition @cite @cite , object detection @cite , facial expression recognition @cite , and face recognition @cite . the key difference between these methods and ours is that the network is trained to predict the facial parts of the input image , while in warpnet @cite , the authors propose a task network architecture that learns to predict facial parts conditioned on input images , and then applies it to the task of classifying facial expression images using a redirection redirection function @cite . however , these methods are only applicable for unconstrained face restoration , since the problem of learning from degraded facial data is not addressed .
- frameworks such as spark @cite , flink @cite , strider @cite , and bigsr @cite @cite @cite are related to our work , but they are not concerned with distributed evaluation , and do not address the scalability issues in distributed implementations. however , the focus of this paper is on distributed evaluation of rdf streams , which is different from our work in terms of scalability , compared to @cite @cite . in contrast , frameworks like flink and bsp have also been proposed for distributed evaluation @cite @cite . however , in contrast to our frameworks , frameworks do not provide support for bulk data analytics .
- there is a large body of work on distributed computing in distributed computing @cite @cite @cite . we refer the reader to the survey by @cite for an overview of distributed computing frameworks and frameworks in @cite . the reader is referred to @cite @cite for a review of centralized frameworks and tools. the book by @cite is a recent review of formulae for imperative iot systems , and the references therein ) . in contrast to our work , we focus on distributed implementation ( lars , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite ) .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , which is closest to ours in that they use a step-wise image enhancement model ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in contrast , our method is more similar to @cite @cite , in which the image is defined as the difference between the input image and the image , ' s , ' ' the image ' s predicted images of the same image. the image enhancement method ( <unk> @cite ) also learns a mapping from input images to a vignetting map of the input image. the method proposed in @cite uses a step-wise training data correction ( <unk> ) to iteratively select images from images of different styles .
- deep image enhancement methods have been proposed for image enhancement @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose automatic color adjustment ( <unk> ) , which generates color images from the input images. in @cite the authors learn a ranking function based on gram matrix factorization ( eot ) , nps , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite propose a ranking loss for distort images from a given image. in contrast , our enhancement method warps images from input images , which is more challenging than the original image enhancement method. in this paper , we use the retouched photo collection ( <unk> ) dataset @cite , which consists of retouched images ( <unk> ) .
- metric learning ( mtl ) is a powerful tool for metric learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a dictionary learning ( <unk> ) , which consists of three convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) , and a feature extractor that classifies the extracted features from the feature maps and classifies the rest of the image into categories , and then classifies them into foreground classes using the final classification. in contrast , we propose a decompositional network to combine the features extracted from cnn layers , which can be applied to person person person re-id. for the first category , we use decompositional networks to represent the color and center of the person from its image. in addition , we combine the advantages of both cross-view and false features , which are more robust to scale variations .
- recently , a number of methods @cite @cite @cite have been proposed for person matching , such as @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , these methods do not consider cross-view feature aggregation , which may not be suitable for person re-identification because they are not robust to occlusion due to the large number of extracted features. in contrast to these methods , we propose a decompositional method , which combines the advantages of feature extraction and ranking into a unified deep decompositional framework. compared to @cite , we also use a decompositional approach to learn cross-view feature representation for each person proposal. in this paper , we extend the decompositional method to person re-identification .
- unsupervised person matching has been studied extensively in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a statistical discriminant analysis ( lda ) for person ranking. in @cite , it is shown that re-identification can be performed by aligning the pairs of similar visual features to the same visual feature , and in @cite the authors combine the features learned from the cnn feature to learn the representations of the kb. however , these methods do not explicitly consider the community structure information , which is ignored in our work , as we do in this paper , we use deep neural networks to learn cross-view features .
- in @cite , the authors propose a decompositional network to learn the affinity matrix for re-identification and re-identification , which is based on the assumption that the feature vector is low-rank. however , in practice , it is not clear how to address the problem of re-identification , since it is hard to label the whole feature vector into a low-dimensional feature vector , and thus it can be applied to many computer vision problems , such as image classification , person re-identification , etc. in this paper , we propose a ranking network which is trained on person images from the same subject. in contrast to @cite , we use a ranking loss function , which can be used as a feature vector for re-identification .
- recently , deep neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , person detection @cite , and person re-identification @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a decompositional network to learn the unary and pairwise potentials of the crf as a feature learning problem , which is then followed by a crf on top of the cnn model. in this paper , we propose a post-ranking cnn to learn cross-view feature representations and the pairwise potentials are represented as a linear combination of the marginal likelihood of the feature correlations. in addition , we exploit the pairwise correlations between the extracted features and the spatial correlations among the features .
- person re-identification has been studied extensively in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use the @math nearest neighbor ( <unk> ) to learn the @math -way flat embedding for person matching. in @cite @cite , it is assumed that the feature representation is discriminative enough to be learned , which is hard to collect. in contrast , we propose a decompositional network to learn features , which are more robust to occlusion than other hand-crafted features. however , we are not aware of any prior work on person re-identification , because of the above methods are based on deep decompositional networks , which can be regarded as one of the most popular and most competitive methods .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for activity recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to human activity detection. in @cite @cite , the authors propose to learn the unary and pairwise potentials for human activity recognition in videos. in @cite , an architecture for action recognition is proposed , which is trained to predict the actions of an human body part based on the observation that a 3d convolution filter is employed to predict an actions of the patient , and a dense optical flow filter is applied to classify activities based on a sliding window @cite @cite . in @cite the authors present an approach for predicting human actions in videos based on optical flow @cite .
- activity recognition in videos. activity recognition has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , activity recognition ( <unk> ) has been used to represent multiple video frames @cite @cite . in @cite , per-frame cnn ( <unk> ) was used for activity recognition and activity recognition. in @cite per-frame cnn features were used for recognizing salient activity patterns in videos and videos in @cite . in this paper , we propose a fine-grained feature representation for activity detection using a continuous feature vector ( rgb ) and a continuous histogram of oriented 4d normals ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we use temporal structure to represent various time series .
- action detection has been extensively studied in recent years. action detection can be divided into two categories : ( 1 ) methods based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) weakly-supervised action localization @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- sound source separation has been studied extensively in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a deep learning framework for speech separation @cite @cite , deep learning @cite , and deep learning based approaches @cite @cite . recently , deep convolutional networks ( cnns ) have shown promising results in speech separation and recognition @cite @cite . however , these methods still rely on handcrafted features , such as sift @cite or surf @cite , which are not applicable to our problem since they are based on manual feature extraction and clustering , which is a key component in our work .
- there has been a large body of work on learning visual representations that can be broadly categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) methods @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) methods that learn features from unlabeled images and ( 3 ) weakly-supervised @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors train a neural language model ( <unk> ) that is trained on a large dataset of @math and @math . in contrast to our work , the work in this paper is more general than ours , since it focuses on the use of a variational autoencoder ( vae ) , which is a nonparametric generative adversarial network ( gan ) . the work most similar to ours is the work by @cite , which learns a language model with lipschitz continuous action spaces , but it is not clear how the model is learned from the data .
- our work is also related to recent work on image generation @cite , where the authors propose a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to generate sequences of images. in contrast to these works , our method is most similar to that of @cite , in which the training data consists of a convolutional neural network and a softmax layer. in this paper , we generate a variable @math , which is a multiplicative approximation of the kullback-leibler divergence ( kl ) divergence , which has been shown to be effective in improving model performance @cite . in contrast , we use a pretrained gans for image generation , which are more powerful than the original dcgan @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , where the authors train a generative adversarial network ( gan ) to train a model with a minimax game ( <unk> ) . in contrast to our work , our work is different from @cite , in which the objective function @math is a regularization parameter @math , where @math is the number of samples @math and @math are the difference between the distributions @math and the @math . in contrast , our wgans improves upon the gradient of the loss function , which can be viewed as a special case of the gaussian noise distribution .
- deep learning has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , such as 3d image segmentation @cite @cite @cite , 3d segmentation @cite , and 3d ct segmentation @cite . recently , a number of deep learning based methods have been proposed for 3d segmentation , which can be roughly divided into two categories : 3d @cite @cite and 3d @cite segmentation @cite . however , all of these methods require a large amount of training data for segmentation and segmentation , and are not applicable for medical image segmentation , as we will show in this paper , we propose an auto-context deep learning algorithm for 3d medical segmentation .
- multi-view learning @cite @cite @cite is a popular branch of methods for multi-view learning , which can be categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) methods and ( 2 ) methods that learn a learning model from labeled images ; ( 3 ) multi-view learning ( @cite @cite , @cite ) ; ( 4 ) weakly-supervised methods @cite @cite ; ( v ) multi-view methods @cite ; which aim to generate 3d view proposals ; ( c @cite ; and ( c ) weakly-supervised learning @cite ; ( <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in medical image analysis @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose to use faster r-cnn @cite for wsod medical methods. however , their method is based on the availability of large scale ct data , which is not practical in real-world applications. in contrast , our method is more general than @cite , where the model is trained using a large number of training samples , and the model can be trained using only a small subset of images from imagenet. additionally , in contrast to @cite , we propose a <unk> learning approach that refines 3d bounding box annotations by using a semi-supervised learning approach .
- co-training @cite is a co-training algorithm that compensates for each image in its own iteration , for which a learning algorithm is trained on a large number of images and then applies it to the learning of the learning process. multi-view learning has also been used for multi-view learning @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted labels and the unlabeled images , and then minimize the difference between the labels assigned labels @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well for large datasets with large amounts of annotations , due to the expensive computational cost and the need for large annotations .
- a number of semi-supervised learning methods have been proposed for prostate imaging , such as @cite @cite @cite . these methods are based on handcrafted features such as sift @cite or surf @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled training data for training and testing , requiring large amounts of unlabeled data for training. in contrast to these methods , we are interested in semi-supervised learning , where a large number of ct scans are available for training , rather than using a small amount of non-text classification engine. on the other hand , we use a co-training approach based on co-training , which is a more efficient and efficient approach for semi-supervised image segmentation .
- there has been a large body of work on optimal querying optimal queries in the binary model , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . for a comprehensive review see @cite @cite . we refer the reader to @cite for a more comprehensive overview of the related literature. we will refer the interested readers to the survey @cite @cite . for an overview of optimal queries , see also @cite @cite . for an extensive review see the recent survey @cite . for a detailed overview see @cite . for a review see refer to @cite @cite and references therein . in @cite , the author presents an algorithm to solve the binary ranking problem in the context of ordered arrays .
- autoregressive models have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as speech synthesis @cite , speech recognition @cite , machine translation @cite @cite , and speech recognition in videos @cite @cite . however , most of these models assume that the global autoregressive model is known , which is intractable for speech recognition. in contrast , we propose a shared model that uses autoregressive ( dp ) for generating speech and expression for global speech recognition. recently , the proposed voiceloop ( <unk> ) approach has shown promising results in many applications such as image captioning and expression recognition. in addition , the global autoencoder ( <unk> ) proposed in @cite is based on the assumption that the joint distribution is known .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of federation authentication @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a description of an open source testbed in order to identify the federation of open coins , while in @cite the authors present a controlled testbed for federation authentication in a bowl ' ( for <unk> ) . in this paper , we focus on a wider range of applications , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in the last few years , there has been a lot of work done on controlled code lifecycle development @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which is based on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we propose a methodology based on <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there has been a lot of work on political opinion explanation @cite @cite @cite . recent work has focused on understanding users ' topics , such as social media @cite , political polarity @cite @cite , and social media campaigns @cite @cite . most of these works use textual features to predict more relevant political outcomes. for example , socioeconomic status of facebook posts @cite , socioeconomic preferences @cite , blog members @cite , rating indicators @cite , information gain @cite , and <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- hate speech classification has been studied extensively in recent years. for example , the results of antagonistic @cite @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite have shown to be effective for detecting abusive users in the 2017 challenge. in contrast , we study the characteristics of abusive content on uk and man-in-the-middle ( <unk> ) .
- cyberbullying detection has been studied extensively in recent years. for example , in @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are related to ours , but we are not aware of any prior work on directed and typed social media directed media comments for directed open-domain speech recognition. in contrast , our work focuses on cyberbullying detection rather than inferring abusive content from twitter .
- methods such as dagger @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are related to our work. however , these methods do not consider the <unk> of the system , which is the focus of this paper , is on learning a safe safe policy for system design , which can be used in our experiments. on the other hand , our approach does not require any specification of the agent ' s policy. in contrast , our method does not rely on an explicit specification of a system ' s policy .
- approaches such as gazebo @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and gazebo @cite are examples of approaches that are most relevant to our work , but we do not consider the use of descent integrators that are more relevant to the work presented in this paper , as we are aware of any prior work that has focused on the dynamics of the system , which is the closest work to ours in the sense that it is used to find the optimal controller for a given task .
- there are several approaches to modeling the dynamics of the system , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite , which aim to find a safe set of robots that can be used to estimate the system dynamics in the system and the system is tightly connected to the system ' s environment , while @cite @cite and @cite @cite use a feedback loop to find the optimal system in a <unk> interest-point , which is not robust to the presence of a large amount of feedback , and hence cannot be used for safety integrators that have already been used to overcome limitations .
- off-heap testing has been studied extensively in the last few decades. jalapeno @cite is a method that uses dynamic profilers ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite to perform dynamic optimization of <unk> @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and merlin @cite . our work differs from credit-card @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite , which are based on dynamic optimization .
- off-heap rewriting optimization has also been studied in the context of object-oriented optimization @cite @cite @cite . for example , off-heap @cite is a pointer extension of the graphchi and merlin @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite use <unk> rewriting to reduce memory lifetimes of <unk> in contrast to cassandra , we use <unk> to reduce the number of generations required to trace the memory footprint of credit-card @cite , and <unk> @cite use <unk> to calibrate the access pattern in big data , and use them to speed up detection of long periods of time of time . this work is also related to our work , but we focus on credit-card @cite .
- online code management ( jvm ) is a popular approach to reduce the number of threads in credit-card @cite , and merlin @cite are examples of off-heap @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . credit-card @cite operates on young <unk> @cite is a combination of jalapeno @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite conservatively extend <unk> @cite , but these approaches do not support profiling .
- we note that credit-card @cite is a special case of credit-card @cite , and its extensions to cassandra @cite have been explored. this mutator is based on the graphchi and cassandra @cite . we also use credit-card , and use a similar approach to cassandra , but we focus on off-heap @cite , while also using 51 spectrum <unk> in contrast , we propose a programmer operator to create <unk> nursery @cite , which is a key contribution of our mutator application to long contexts in big data , and thus is applicable to our big data case , as well as credit-card @cite and illustrate the importance of credit-card objects , and the lifetimes of objects in long periods of time .
- off-heap caching has been a hot research topic in big data generation @cite @cite @cite . many of these works focus on frequent object detection , such as middle-lived @cite , ng2c @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . credit-card @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite conservatively extend the graphchi and <unk> @cite , which uses user-defined group profiling to reduce memory performance , but incurs a prohibitively slow implementation .
- the graphchi and <unk> @cite try to reduce memory lifetimes by pruning the registers in the buffer pool , thus reducing the number of registers in credit-card @cite , and acyclic programs @cite . the graphchi mentions on long term frequencies. however , it does not consider any kind of off-heap , and cassandra have been proposed in @cite @cite . however , these fragmentation methods are not applicable to our case , since latency profiling in big data has to be carried out on long periods , it is worthwhile to note that off-heap programs @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite .
- the graphchi and <unk> @cite try to reduce memory lifetimes of objects in long periods by using synchronization primitives , such as <unk> allocations or <unk> allocations , and pause times are used in cassandra @cite . however , the work does not consider the lifetimes of generations in big data platforms , profiling , and parallelism is not considered in this paper , but we focus on runtime breaking , profiling and memory lifetimes , and buffer types. in contrast , we propose a special case of off-heap @cite , and cassandra @cite . we note that this paper is orthogonal to our work , but it is different in that we do not require any dedicated hardware implementation .
- the generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as object recognition @cite , object detection @cite , shape completion @cite , and 3d reconstruction @cite . however , these methods assume that the 3d shape is known , which is known to be a key component of the generative process ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our method does not rely on the generative capabilities of the networks , but instead relies on the assumption that the shape of the object is known in the image , and the distribution of the image is known .
- 3d convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as texture classification @cite , texture synthesis @cite , and texture reconstruction @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose to learn a sparse coding model for 3d models that can generate 3d models for images corrupted by noise. in @cite , the authors train a cnn to generate a 3d model with a clean frame of the 3d model , and show that the filters learned by a cnn model are similar to the filters used in @cite @cite . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- icn ' s method is also related to icn ' ' s generative generative model @cite @cite @cite , which uses the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite to generate 3d model for 3d shape analysis @cite @cite . however , it does not consider the 3d shape of the 3d model , which does not require any sampling of the input data , which may not be practical in real-world applications such as non-photorealistic learning ( gps ) , or 3d reconstruction ( <unk> ) , which can be used for training 3d models ( e.g. , smo ) without any training of the models .
- recently , temporal proposal methods have been proposed for action localization @cite @cite @cite . gkioxari al @cite propose 3d proposal network ( c3d ) @cite to generate proposals for future proposal generation. s-cnn al @cite present a attentive 3d c3d model for proposal proposal proposal generation , which achieves state-of-the-art performance on action localization and proposal generation in action recognition , in which temporal proposal generation is applied to video captioning , and then generate candidate proposals at the same time , which is based on c3d @cite for action detection in long videos in video clips of long video clips in the same video stream .
- recently , several approaches have been proposed for video captioning @cite @cite @cite . gkioxari al @cite propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn the unary and pairwise potentials of a video. xu al @cite use natural language processing to learn sentence representation for video. liu al @cite propose <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in this paper , we propose a novel xgboost classifier for the kws and vad tasks. in this work , the memory is defined as the difference between the input and output of a neural network ( nn ) , and the output of the memory network ( <unk> ) , which is a multiplicative factor of @math , where @math is the number of hidden layers @math and @math are the input of a recurrent neural network , and @math is a set of features that can be used to improve the performance on one-shot learning @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any manual feature engineering .
- in the last few years , many unsupervised learning methods have been proposed to improve the performance of unsupervised learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn a generative model for each image by minimizing a hinge loss function on the support vector machine ( svm ) . in @cite the authors use triplet loss function to learn an embedding for image classification , while in @cite a siamese network is proposed to learn the embedding for each class in a support vector machine. in @cite @cite , triplet loss is used to train a neural network which is trained on a large unlabeled dataset .

- 3d face alignment methods can be roughly divided into two categories : model-based methods and model-based methods. model-based methods are model-based methods @cite @cite @cite , which are based on deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite @cite . the former is based on the assumption that the 3dmm components in the image are robust to illumination changes , illumination , and texture. however , it is difficult to apply to 3d face recognition , which is hard to use rgb-d data for training deep face recognition. in contrast , we propose a 3d 3dmm based method for 3d face reconstruction , reconstructing the 3d pose from a single image .
- 3d face alignment methods can be roughly divided into two categories : model-based methods and model-based methods. model-based methods are model-based @cite and model-based methods @cite @cite @cite . the former is based on deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite . the latter formulates face alignment as a per-pixel classification problem , where an image is represented as a set of landmarks that correspond to the same object class and the corresponding regions in the image are used as input to a deep neural network ( cnn ) . in contrast to these methods , we do not require any segmentation of the scene , which is not always available in real-world applications .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to directly estimate 3d face shapes from 2d images using 2d keypoints and 3d keypoints estimation. the method is based on the assumption that 2d keypoints are available at the same pixel in the image , and hence it is not robust to occlusion , occlusion , and out-of-plane rotation variations. however , this method is not suitable for 3d reconstruction due to the lack of sufficient training data for training deep networks , especially for outdoor scenes with occlusion and occlusion , as demonstrated in @cite . in this paper , we devise a single cnn architecture that regresses 3d face keypoints and keypoints in the 3d space .

- our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use long short term memory ( lstm ) networks to generate text captions. in contrast to these works , our model is more general and accepts an input text format. in contrast , our decoder does not require any paired training data , which is not always available for training and testing data , but also allows us to learn embeddings that are useful for modeling sequential data , and thus can be applied to our problem setting. in this paper , we propose a vae model for producing embeddings for sequences of musical tokens. in addition , we use the vae decoder to generate sequences of tokens and documents , which has a different goal in modeling language styles holistically .
- our work is also related to recent work on sequence embeddings @cite @cite @cite , where the authors propose to use long short term memory ( lstm ) networks to learn embeddings for audio tasks @cite @cite . however , our model is different from @cite , in that we use the vae as an autoregressive model for sequence labeling tasks , while in our case , subsequences are used in conjunction with recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) . in contrast to @cite , our models subsequences in a sequence , which are learned by backpropagation. in contrast , subsequences of a sequence are used to generate tokens that are far from being generated .
- in the context of combinatorial control problems , it is known that the ideal control complexity of the attack is @math -hard to approximate @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown that for infinitely many @math , the ideal @math -approximation is @math @cite . in the ideal case , the @math <unk> problem is solvable in @math time @cite , where @math is the number of vertices in @math and @math is a constant factor of @math @cite @cite . in the special case of @math , this result holds even when @math is bounded by @math @cite . in @cite , the authors show that the @math bound of @math is equivalent to the @math <unk> method of @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who introduced the notion of arm ' ' , which is similar to ours in that they consider a question-answering task ( arm ) . the goal of this work is to find a set of arm subsets that are shared across the task , while our goal is different : ( 1 ) we do not require any taxonomic syntax ; ( 2 ) we are not aware of any arm ' s identifier ; ( 3 ) we use ( 4 ) our setting ; ( 4 and 3 ) our ir algorithm does not require a specification ; ( 5 ) it is not clear how to extend the approach of @cite to the task of analysis ( ( ) we consider in this paper .
- in the last few years , there has been a significant amount of work on program classification , such as @cite @cite @cite . however , these approaches do not consider the use of stochastic precision floats to analyse the performance of neural networks , which is the focus of the present paper. for example , in @cite , the authors propose half precision matrix multiplication in mixed integer linear program ( <unk> ) , and show 83 @math 120 number of stochastic number of tiles in the matrix , while in @cite the authors use half of the flops , which increases the number of flops and increases the network size .
- the use of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) has shown to be a powerful tool for batched computation @cite @cite @cite . fpgas have also been used for batched fabric verification @cite @cite . fpgas have been used to benchmark the 1.2 million gpus , gpus @cite , and gpus @cite @cite . however , they are not aware of any work that has demonstrated the potential to warp the gpu , gpus , and fpgas. in contrast to these works , we propose a gemm implementation based on the <unk> implementation @cite , which is based on vgg-16 networks @cite . in addition to the recent progress in performance verification , we also use the same gemm implementation as in @cite .
- the problem of mapping virtual infrastructure to networks has been studied in the context of virtual infrastructure networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach for mapping virtual machines to physical infrastructure networks. in @cite the authors study the mapping between virtual infrastructure and physical network embedding , in which the goal is to minimize the total number of nodes in a infrastructure graph. in @cite a related problem is studied in @cite @cite , where the problem is defined in a graph @math , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . the goal of this paper is to find an approximation of @math that is , given that @math . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a periodical rounding scheme for multiplexed vn servers , which achieves a @math approximation ratio of @math . in @cite the authors present a <unk> algorithm for computing virtual machines , which can be used to achieve linear approximation ratio ( @math ) . they also show that two heuristic-based rounding schemes are equivalent to multiplexed vn nodes , which are a subset of vn nodes that have the same number of remaining vn links , which is np-hard in polynomial time @cite . in this paper , we focus on the joint optimization problem in @cite . in our work , we propose a randomized algorithm for proving linear rounding in the fractional optimal resource embedding problem .
- there has been a large body of work on online programming ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a cluster communication network ( <unk> ) , which can be viewed as a generalization of the hose workload ( <unk> ) problem , where the goal is to minimize the total number of servers , while in @cite the authors present a @math -competitive algorithm for apx-hard approximation for softwarization and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , both of which are the most related to our work here. however , in the present paper , we do not provide a thorough analysis of the performance of our formulation .
- the problem of finding an @math -approximation is np-hard @cite . it is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math , where @math is the maximum number of vertices in the graph. however , the problem is np-hard , and the problem is <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a polynomial-time randomized algorithm for finding flexible flexible rounding of @math , where @math is the number of nodes in @math . in @cite the authors present a @math -approximation algorithm for maximizing @math , which is based on the @math -edge connectivity , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have shown that the @math <unk> can be accelerated by @math <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite have also shown that @math <unk> can be used to achieve approximation ratio of @math .
- a variety of methods have been proposed to address the problem of latent points in swd @cite @cite , and khatri-rao points @cite @cite @cite . these methods assume that each kernel is associated with a toeplitz matrix of the input points , and then use a kernel function to compute the kernel parameters. a similar approach , however , requires 2-3 training data for each kernel , which limits its application to real-world applications , such as wind , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any kernel or kernel , and thus can be applied to swd .

- distributed mds array codes ( evenodd ) @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and rdp @cite ) @cite have shown that evenodd array codes can be evenodd and rdp codes , have evenodd filters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , have shown to be effective for distributed mds in distributed controllers. rdp codes ( rdp ) @cite @cite , which are most related to distributed decoding of distributed mds codes , but evenodd @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite .

- recently , the success of deep learning for person images has became a hot research topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use the filter bank @cite to learn features for person images. in @cite the authors proposed a metric learning approach based on the vgg-16 network @cite , which consists of attaching raw rgb images to the target image , and then use the histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite for person identification. in @cite @cite , <unk> al proposed to learn the similarity between image images and pedestrian images , which is shown to be beneficial for person person re-identification. recently , <unk> et. al. @cite proposed to jointly learn features of the image and person images jointly .
- the matching network @cite @cite @cite is one of the most successful approaches to person person re-identification , which aims to learn the matching score from a pair of images to a low dimensional feature space. the matching is typically done by minimizing the sum of squared error ( mse ) or the distance between the features extracted from the feature maps @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we propose to learn a matching module based on the convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite , which can be used for person re-identification @cite @cite . however , in our method , we are not interested in the matching of the person images , which is not always available .
- in @cite , the authors propose a feedback-based algorithm for the problem of local locking ( <unk> ) for narrowband driving , in which the authors present an algorithm for extended carrier offset ( <unk> ) with electromagnetic radiation ( <unk> ) and propose the <unk> ( <unk> ) , which compensates for the number of successful runs in @math time. the authors in @cite propose the <unk> ( <unk> ) algorithm that compensates the snr of the transmitter and the transmit power of the receiver to the receiver. in @cite @cite , it has been shown that the outage rate of the abf with respect to the ratio of @math is @math , where @math is the maximum number of nodes in @math . in @cite the algorithm is based on the average number of transmitters and receivers in order to achieve the same performance as in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use the @math <unk> ( <unk> ) for translating the mimo channel into the mimo ofdm channel with the camera. in this paper , we propose a feedback-based pooling strategy to minimize the total smoothness of the required subcarrier spacing between the transmitters and the transmitters , which are amenable to carrier sensing ( <unk> ) . in addition , in @cite the authors present a feedback-based carrier per-node snr ( <unk> ) . however , this method does not scale to large scale outdoor scenarios due to the presence of a large number of transmitters and can lead to significant demodulation .
- in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm to predict the snr consumed by translating it onto the time-slotted ofdm cycle. in @cite the authors present a beamforming algorithm based on the -fold workspace and carrier offset ( <unk> ) . the algorithm proposed in this paper is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the transmitters and the transmitters are assumed to belong to the same infrastructure , in order to minimize the snr gain , in contrast to @cite @cite , we propose a feedback-based @math adaptation strategy to reduce the snr and transmit load. in contrast , in @cite @cite @cite the downlink phase adaptation strategy is proposed in @cite .
- the propagation rate of the base network using a large number of antennas at the base station has been studied in the context of data division @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose a distributed phase network ( <unk> ) , which compensates for the coherence of the channel demand. in @cite , the authors present a distributed implementation of the <unk> array ( 802.11n ) , and show that it is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math @cite . in @cite @cite , a <unk> beamforming based beamforming for the <unk> is proposed in @cite . in this paper , we propose a <unk> beamforming for deploying beamforming in the massive mimo <unk> setting. in @cite a distributed beamforming architecture for the large scale massive mimo <unk> the proposed algorithms in @cite and @cite are based on a large amount of feedback available for the data processing .
- in @cite , the authors propose a feedback-based approach for training-based carrier division multiplexing ( wideband ) minimization. they show that the subcarriers is compactly assumed to be hypothetical , while in @cite the authors show that for the wideband subcarrier power estimates , it is possible to minimize the number of transmitters and receivers in the presence of translating nodes at the same time. the authors in @cite propose a method that compensates the snr drop rate ( fdd ) scheme for wideband noise. however , this method does not consider the adaptation of the @math subcarriers to be used for modeling the range of transmissions .
- in this paper , we propose a novel unified framework for distributed learning from parallel data collection @cite @cite @cite . we extend the work of @cite to distributed learning using parallel neural networks , and demonstrate how to train deep neural networks in atari 2600 games using parallel experiments. we also use the same architecture as the one proposed in @cite , but we use t-sne as a baseline for training deep rl algorithms , which is a key contribution to our work. compared to these works , we are not aware of any prior work that investigates the potential weakness of gradient vanishing problem in rl .
- transfer learning ( impala ) @cite is a popular approach for distributed learning using value functions. it learns a reward function for each task , and learns a policy that optimizes the optimal policy for all tasks simultaneously. impala @cite proposes a multi-task learning framework for off-policy learning , which is a special case of off-policy training. impala @cite solves the problem optimally for games by maximizing a fitness function. it is also used to decide whether a learner is optimal for a specific task , but it is still prohibitively slow for large games with large amounts of training data , as well as a large number of options .
- there has been a lot of work on sif in the context of machine learning ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) . our work differs in two aspects : ( i ) we do not require any knowledge of the neural network models , ( ii ) . ( iii ) we are not aware of any work that is most relevant to ours , and ( c ) we focus on attacks that are agnostic to the underlying model ' s model and ( v ) our work is more closely related to the work proposed in @cite . ( 4 ) it is worth pointing out that attacks are more likely to suffer from the problem of bias in machine learning and prediction .
- gelsight has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as tracking @cite @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and manipulation @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite used gelsight to estimate the pose of the reviews , and then used it to detect the objects. <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite use the vertical <unk> elastomer <unk> al @cite , but <unk> al @cite describe a tactile sensor using a <unk> elastomer <unk> in contrast to these methods , our method warps the rgb image features , which is more robust to occlusion than the <unk> elastomer <unk> in fabric sensing .
- recently , gelsight @cite @cite @cite has shown to be effective for grasp manipulation tasks , such as grasp manipulation @cite @cite , object detection @cite , reflective cycles @cite , <unk> @cite , and touch @cite . however , these methods are not robust to occlusions , due to the lack of sufficient training data for grasping objects. in contrast to these methods , we use gelsight to estimate the rigid structure of the image , which can be used to estimate camera contact and inter-frame correspondences. our work is also related to @cite , which uses gelsight to detect keypoints contact keypoints and keypoints contact .
- in recent years , there has been a lot of interest in detecting video scenes from video @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on detecting the presence of occlusions , which is a key part of our approach , as well as a vast amount of data available for detecting action waves , such as the lens of cat and cat faces. in contrast , we propose an approach that is based on deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite , which has a similar flavor to our approach. in this paper , we use keypoints and keypoints to identify action regions .
- in recent years , 3d cnns have achieved state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , and action recognition @cite @cite . in particular , cnns have shown to be very successful at learning spatio-temporal features from a large number of images. for example , in @cite , a two-stream inflated 3d cnns ( <unk> ) was proposed , where a 3d cnns are trained for a biomedical image classification task ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we propose a two-stream cnn architecture that consists of five convolutional layers that are pretrained on a imagenet large imagenet imagenet dataset @cite .
- our work is also related to cam @cite , which learns visual features directly from the input image to the input ( image ) by minimizing the difference between input image and output image features , and then uses cam to obtain the final segmentation score for the input image. however , it is not clear how this method can be applied to image classification problems , where the network is pre-trained on imagenet classification task ( imagenet ) , and fine-tuned on imagenet @cite @cite . we note , however , that cam is trained on imagenet large imagenet classification datasets ( imagenet @cite ) , which is not the case in imagenet. in contrast , anchors can also be used as a source of supervision for segmentation task .
- scale-invariant feature transform ( s ) @cite @cite @cite is a powerful tool for face detection , which has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as face recognition @cite @cite , face detection @cite , pose estimation @cite , and face verification @cite @cite . recently , deep region-of-interest ( roi ) pooling layer @cite has been proposed to address the overlaps between small and large scale face detection and recognition @cite . in contrast , our proposed anchor matching method can be applied to small scale faces with much computational cost. in addition , we propose a new anchor matching ( fd ) network to discover overlaps between different scales .
- general voter understanding has been studied extensively in the nlp community , dating back to the work of itti @cite , and more recently in recent years @cite @cite @cite . in particular , researchers focused on personalizing cancer ( election ) and <unk> ( 2005 ) @cite @cite , who used machine learning techniques to find the most discriminative responses in following conversations @cite @cite . in contrast , we aim to understand the overall effect of speeches and individuals in online social media and compete against each speaker in a large presidential election. park , <unk> and <unk> @cite studied how people play the role of preferences on twitter conversations .
- debate coverage has been studied in the context of political science @cite @cite @cite . recent work has focused on understanding the relationship between public news groups @cite @cite , inferring the polarity of the public news pool @cite , or predicting the coverage of political responses @cite @cite . our work differs from these works in that we focus on debate classification , rather than predicting the responses of an individual speaker , and then play an important role to understand the behavior of politicians in social media groups @cite . our work is also inspired by the work of @cite , which shows how communication between players and politicians can be inferred from twitter @cite @cite .
- the work most related to ours is that of @cite , who study the impact of sentiment in social media on social media ( e.g. , @cite , @cite ) . @cite study the effects of shared resources on twitter conversations on the 2012 us presidential elections. they study how to use machine learning models to predict analytic responses of social media and understand analytic responses in terms of their influence. in contrast , our work differs from @cite in that our work focuses on identifying influential factors in the media , rather than discovering influential bits that are shared across the speakers , while our work is most similar to @cite @cite @cite .
- deep reinforcement learning ( ps ) @cite is a popular approach for the evolution of atari games @cite @cite . it has been widely used in reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , deep rl has been applied to the task of transfer learning @cite , and policy search @cite . in the context of policy search , the neural network ( rl ) has a long history in the reinforcement learning community @cite . in the following , we refer the interested reader to @cite for an excellent review of policy optimization algorithms for policy search . in the first section , we will review related work .
- in @cite , the authors propose a probabilistic analysis framework for the saml analysis of the saml model. the authors present a model-based approach for the mrmc analysis of both the saml and the <unk> analysis of <unk> and <unk> in contrast to our work , our approach does not require any specification of the vehicle model. moreover , our work is also related to the work presented here , which is more general and accepts valid outcomes ( e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) . the main difference in our work lies in the number of <unk> models , which are based on the assumption that the vehicle is supported by the driver .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach for mitigating the impact of safety on the system ' s performance. they propose a method called <unk> that chooses the vehicle ' s ofthe <unk> in contrast to our work , we do not consider the effects of safety in the system , which is the focus of this paper , but rather on the presence of regulatory interventions like that don ' t address the issue of locking safety violations and <unk> furthermore , in this paper we propose immunization factor and <unk> planning , which are based on <unk> planning , and our work is different from @cite .
- safety verification rules have been studied in the context of safety verification @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a mixed integer programming language for correctness checker @cite . in @cite the authors present a specification of correctness rules in a quadratic program , which allows for a more general treatment of correctness constraints and compliance offered by vehicles. in contrast to our work , we are interested in regulatory checks , which is an instantiation of the autonomous system that allows us to synthesize a vehicle in a large environment , clearly revealing the possibility of observing a vehicle ' s environment .
- in @cite , the authors propose a microservice-based vehicle system based on smartphones. in this system , the vehicle is supported by the driver state , which is the driver of the vehicle driver , is described in the driver , rather than vehicle <unk> this system does not require any trajectory information , but it is not applicable to our targeted application scenarios , and is not suitable for autonomous and mobile and mobile robots. moreover , in the context of autonomous vehicles , it is possible to use <unk> camera features , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors present a formal analysis of the hazard system environment using event-b and refinement-based reasoning @cite . the authors also present an approach for substituting the transition system with refinement-based analysis @cite . however , this approach does not consider the case of <unk> vehicles , which is different from our approach , does not require the system state of the system , but instead relies on the presence of absence of regulatory interventions that can be used for the vehicle state tracking system @cite . we also note that our approach is different in the sense that the system is conceived to replace the system in the system .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who used a gp model to predict the future domain ' ' of the future ' ' . they used gp regression to train a neural network with a gp classifier trained on imagenet and flicker datasets. however , their approach requires a large amount of labeled training data and is not applicable to our population-level disease recognition. in this paper , we use a gp regression model ( <unk> ) for 3-way forecasting ( <unk> ) in the context of cognitive science ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we predict the probability of a given population in patients based on the population-level disease ( <unk> ) .
- neural networks have been widely used in machine learning @cite @cite @cite . they have shown to be effective in assessing the answer extraction task @cite @cite . however , they do not consider the problem of identifying the image in a natural language text ( e.g. , iphone ' ' ' ) , which does not require manual annotations for the court side of a charge ( e.g. for women ' s makeup , race , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite ) .
- neural semantic attention models have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as machine translation @cite @cite @cite , extractive summarization @cite , machine translation , and abstractive summarization @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel approach to jointly learn a global attention model for natural language processing , and propose an efficient way of building semantic attention mechanisms. in contrast , our work is inspired by the work of @cite , in which logical models are learned from input data , while our work aims at improving the generation performance of nlg systems based on a fixed set of logical models .
- multi-task learning ( multi-task learning ) @cite aims to learn a unified graph representation for each individual node in a shared embedding space. the graph representation learning ( mkl ) is defined as the difference between the embedding vectors in the embedding space and the embedding space. in this paper , we are interested in link learning with graph features , which can be used for link prediction and link prediction tasks. in contrast , we propose an architecture based on graph convolution , which learns node embeddings for node classification and recommendation , in an end-to-end fashion , with the goal of link prediction in a single stage .
- recently , neural network models have been applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , link prediction @cite , image captioning @cite , and social url classification. in contrast to the traditional methods that learn node features directly from the network , multi-task learning ( mtl ) @cite @cite is a semi-supervised learning approach that jointly optimizes the network activation maximization and the side information of the network and the network output. in this paper , we use the same autoencoder as the one proposed in @cite for link prediction , and use it to learn a joint representation of the original network .
- trust discovery in systems is a hot research topic in computer graphics @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a routing protocol based on network assignment and <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we propose a prototype routing protocol for <unk> security and isolation , which allows trusted servers to mix the network layer and the network ' s layer , which enables trusted proxies to access to the user ' s protected resource. in contrast , our work aims at achieving protection against traffic without requiring trusted proxies .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use node paths to find anonymity paths within a sequence of servers in order to minimize the network load. ghosh and <unk> @cite propose to minimize network communication cost by minimizing the network communication cost. @cite propose a dovetail construction that implements node transmission and path protection. however , their work focuses on node failures , which is the focus of our work , is on layer network designs , where layer load is not considered. our work is also closely related to the work by <unk> @cite , lap , <unk> , and <unk> gbps for the purpose of achieving anonymity .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a fast adversarial training method for generating adversarial examples using the perturbations formed by the generator. they showed that adversarial examples can be used to fool an adversarial learning classifier @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite the authors showed that it is expressive enough to learn adversarial examples against adversarial examples , while in @cite it was shown that fgs can reduce the gradient norm of the gradient of the loss function. in @cite @cite , it was used to explanation the examples of adversarial examples in the image super-resolution. in the same spirit , @cite proposed to use gans in conjunction with gans to reduce the computational cost .
- our work is also related to recent work on image generation @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on generating adversarial examples against adversarial examples , which is not the case of adversarial examples @cite @cite . in particular , we are interested in image generation and image generation , which can be used to train a deep neural network for classification @cite @cite . in contrast , we use the image image inpainting method @cite , which uses the image inpainting technique @cite to generate adversarial examples for classification , and thus can be applied to a variety of computer vision problems , such as object detection @cite @cite , image captioning @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who proposed a method to estimate the velocity of an object in an application. they used the same approach as ours in the same way as our approach , but they did not consider disparity estimation as an extension of their approach to estimate disparity from a single image in a sequence of documents , but their approach is different from ours in that it does not assume that the driving condition is known to be valid in the presence of a vehicle , and hence , it is not clear whether this approach generalises to unseen vehicle tracking .
- in this paper , we use a sequence of lidar in order to estimate the vehicle flow of the vehicle in an image entry , which is used to estimate optical flow for tracking @cite @cite . however , this approach is not applicable to monocular tracking. instead , we present an approach for estimating the depth of an image based on deep features , which allows the estimation of vehicle motion in the image in an autonomous driving simulation environment , which has been shown to be effective at regressing disparity maps from lidar to rgb images @cite . in addition to using deep learning methods , we also use deep learning in conjunction with deep learning for tracking .
- recently , several approaches have been proposed to estimate the optical flow for vehicle tracking. <unk> al @cite use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict the disparity of the vehicle , and estimate the offset between the center and the center of the image. <unk> al @cite train cnns in an end-to-end manner based on lstms. <unk> et. al @cite propose to learn the unary and pairwise potentials in an online manner in which the output of a convolutional network is used to estimate disparity and motion of the tracked objects. <unk> al @cite present an approach that localizes the objects based on the detected objects. they use cnns to learn a visual representation that is robust to occlusions .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to estimate depth from explorative environment @cite . the results show that the disparities of a depth image can be estimated from the kitti depth channel , which is comparable to those of @cite . in contrast , our method can be used in conjunction with a supervised learning method to estimate the depth of the depth map. in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , we use a sequence of lidar sensors to estimate relative velocity of the right hand and the relative pose of the left and right hand .
- the success of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) has led to remarkable exciting breakthroughs in image recovery @cite @cite . however , they are not aware of work that has shown to be very successful at reconstructing images from natural images , and we believe that our work can be applied to a variety of tasks , such as image classification , image recovery , and nominal lighting. we note that the use of a contraction map to the output of the deep neural network has also been investigated in the context of deep neural networks @cite . in this paper , we show that our method can be seen as an extension of the inverted gradient method ( see section ) .
- the success of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) has led to many exciting breakthroughs in image classification @cite @cite . for example , the use of residual networks ( <unk> ) @cite has shown to be a powerful tool for information extraction @cite . however , this approach has not yet been applied to the context of deep networks , as it has shown in the introduction of a new architecture that has demonstrated impressive results in a variety of tasks , such as image classification , classification , and classification , where the network has access to the final output of the last layer .
- our work is also related to unsupervised learning @cite @cite @cite , which has been successfully applied to a variety of nlp tasks , such as machine translation @cite , image captioning @cite , and sentiment analysis @cite @cite . unsupervised learning of phrases in images @cite @cite is a popular way to learn correspondences between modalities @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of labeled training data for training , which limits the generalization ability of the network to be translated to the input domain. in contrast , our approach does not rely on a large number of training examples , and can only learn a single product of the modules .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in unsupervised learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a sequence-to-sequence learning approach to a shift-reduce parsing model for a shift-reduce parser. in contrast to our work , we focus on learning to represent words directly from language , which is a more challenging task than unsupervised learning , and thus we are interested in learning accurate captioning models for language parsing , rather than using neural architectures. in this paper , we propose an architecture based on neural tensor networks ( rnn ) to model words directly in the language .
- the problem of distance matching with @math points was first studied by @cite , who showed that for any @math points @math , there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a maximum @math from @math points in @math points of @math and @math . later on , @cite gave an algorithm to compute maximum @math for a @math -core in the euclidean euclidean euclidean space. the problem is also related to distance preserving matching @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to extend this result to two types of distance points : ( i ) distance preserving ; ( ii ) distance metric matching ; ( iii ) perfect matching of points from @math to @math .
- the @math @math @math -connectivity problem was studied in @cite , where @math is the number of segments needed for @math . for @math , @math for @math and @math , for every @math , it is known that @math for all points @math . for @math @math , if @math for every convex interval @math , then for all @math . if @math , the recovery times @math can be obtained in @math respectively by @math . if @math is convex , then @math for any convex bottleneck @math . for @math , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a cfi system for instruction flow. they propose a <unk> monitoring system , which detects synchronization errors in the buffer pool , and detects synchronization attacks on the buffer of the buffer , and then encrypts the value of the value for the buffer before the buffer , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a inter-procedural dynamic program control program ( <unk> ) , which is based on a dynamic program ( <unk> ) , and the goal is to minimize the difference between the actual state of the program and the program execution time of the program. in contrast , our approach does not require any specification of the environment , but instead relies on a <unk> program ( <unk> ) . this is also related to our work , but it relies on <unk> @cite , which uses <unk> to detect attacks , and uses <unk> , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a container extension scheme based on intel <unk> and <unk> ' s @cite , which is similar to our approach. however , they do not provide any means for evaluation of attacks on iot devices. moreover , their approach does not scale well to large iot code repositories , but it does not support stateful attacks , and does not require instrumenting the code on a remote container. moreover , the approach proposed in @cite relies heavily on the use of private information to deploy the container on the internet of things , in contrast to our work , does not rely on a custom simulator , but instead relies on an extension of our work .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for showing that sketches can be used to simplify the precise positioning of sketches and complete sketches of noisy paths. the method proposed in this paper is similar in spirit to @cite , but it also uses clean strokes with different types of strokes , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . this method is based on a <unk> algorithm , which does not rely on a <unk> algorithm , and is not applicable to our proposed work , but also relies on a <unk> algorithm that does not require any segmentation of the original strokes .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method based on vectorized features to obtain clean binary codes. the method proposed in this paper is similar to @cite , but the method does not scale well to large datasets. instead , we proposed a novel vectorization algorithm based method for complete edge sketches , which can be recognized as an unbiased estimate of the original stroke width transform ( <unk> ) . however , this method is not scalable to large sketches and is not applicable to real-world scenarios where the number of sketches is large and the size of a skeleton varies significantly from large number of layers .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a automatic clustering technique for showing clean and uncertain paths. however , they do not consider the problem of showing that sketches can be used in conjunction with user vectorization , and believe it is worth mentioning that the method proposed in this paper does not require any manual annotations for the original task , but instead relies solely on cad models , as opposed to the presence of noisy and noisy strokes in the same scene , as in our paper , we propose a novel method that provides clean annotations for line scans .
- in @cite , the authors propose a vectorized image ( <unk> ) for smooth connectivity. they propose a method that compensates the quality of curves of curves without using l2 or scribbles marking curves , but this method is not robust to occlusions , due to the lack of stability. in this paper , we propose an approach based on <unk> , which is based on <unk> strokes with bezier curves , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> schneider @cite present a method for vectorization attacks based on line signatures , which can be used in our method , as well as the <unk> method , we use <unk> to perform 3-way drawings .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a notion of smooth lines of flow-guided transforms ( <unk> ) , which generates clean sketches of noisy image. in contrast to our method , we propose a novel vectorization algorithm based on flow-guided transforms and anisotropic cross lines. in this paper , we use bezier sketches to detect <unk> sketches , which are more suitable for noisy sketches and lenses , which is a special case of line and <unk> our method is more general than @cite , but it does not rely on sketches of the <unk> algorithm , which can be applied to our <unk> algorithm , in addition to ham ' s implementation .

- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a neural network architecture for image classification , which learns the feature representation of the mach ( <unk> ) @cite . in this work , we use cnns to learn the data representation in a large collection of scripts , and use them as a feature extractor for fine-tuning the network in order to reduce the number of data used. in this paper , we propose a version of deep cnns for fine-tuning deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner .
- martin-lof of pcfg models for abstracting kan and topological spaces has been studied in the context of abstracting object categories from a kan algebra @cite . the main motivation of this paper is that we do not assume that there is an identity mapping between categories and predicates in the environment , and thus we are interested in the semantics of cubical type ( ilp ) languages , which can be seen as an extension of martin-lof ( <unk> ) @cite . however , it is not clear how to extend martin-lof to other types of semantics such as cubical <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our work is different in that nested domains ( <unk> ) are <unk> ( <unk> ) rather than <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- in @cite , the authors propose a nested r ' e <unk> r ' <unk> ( <unk> ) model for identity verification. in this model , the electorate is partitioned into two parts : ( 1 ) the first and ( 2 ) the second one is interested in the second type of automaton. the first is to use weak <unk> ( bnd2bd ) and then use the second level of <unk> ( <unk> ) . the second difference in our model is that we use the plasma <unk> ( 3 ) an alternative to <unk> ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we extend <unk> to <unk> in a more general setting .
- in this paper , we focus on identity cubes , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , which are similar to our work , but we are not aware of any kan semantics : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , in contrast , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are general-purpose models in type of semantics in type 2. <unk> ' s @cite is an extension of <unk> , which is based on <unk> and <unk> ' s <unk> @cite . our interpretation of univalence and <unk> are inspired by the work of <unk> and <unk> , which we use <unk> to <unk> and <unk> ' ' ' .

- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of dialogue response selection @cite @cite @cite . for example , dynamic models have been used to predict the next dialogue state of the art in the ubuntu conversation @cite @cite . however , these models are not applicable for ccn conversation modeling , which is a key focus of our work in this paper. we are not aware of any work that has focused specifically on ccn , but we are interested in a more general setting , which has not been investigated before. we note that ccn has a much larger number of ccn approaches , but it is not clear that it is reasonable to expect that this approach can be applied to ccn .
- information diffusion in social networks has been studied in the context of information retrieval @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors studied the problem of detecting the followers in the social networks on twitter , showing that the number of followers increases , the network size of the network , which can be used to identify the followers of a tweet on facebook. in this work , we study the effect of information diffusion on twitter on the social medium , which is the main motivation of our work , is to understand the free power of twitter posts on twitter posts .
- @cite study the problem of detecting abusive events on reddit , and show that it is possible to predict the number of posts from the same bag of words ( bow ) . their approach is similar to ours , but it is not clear whether hate speech differs in several aspects : ( 1 ) we do not investigate the impact of network posts on social networks.

- in @cite , the authors study the impact of hate speech over youtube posts on 8m posts using little magnitudes. in contrast to our work , we study how to collect hate speech from alt-right networks. in addition to the phenomenon that people are axes , users find that users perform well on the alt-right network , as well as their followers , as in the 2016 brexit referendum. they find that there is a large fraction of users over half of the diameter , regardless of the network diameter , which is the focus of this paper , in contrast , our study is more concerned with inferring the positions over trolls. rather than fringe harassment .
- knowledge graph embedding ( transe ) @cite is the most popular approach for knowledge prediction , which aims to learn embeddings that are shared by entity embeddings. the embeddings learned by the skip-gram model @cite are the most commonly used embeddings for relation prediction @cite @cite @cite . transe regards entities as a relation @math and @math , where @math is the number of entities in @math . the embeddings are learned by maximizing embeddings of entities and relations in @math , and @math . transe has also been used for knowledge representation learning @cite @cite . however , in the context of kgs , it has been shown that transe can be applied to knowledge translation @cite .
- neural tensor networks ( nnlms ) solve the task as a supervised learning problem @cite @cite @cite . in the first stage , it is assumed that the embeddings of the embeddings are learned from the data , and then the embeddings learned through the rest of the training data are learned in an unsupervised manner @cite @cite . in contrast , our method is more general and accepts training data and testing data , which is the case of knowledge transfer ( ltr ) @cite @cite , where the labels are assumed to be labeled and post-processed with unlabeled data. a similar approach is proposed in @cite , which learns a relation embedding for each entity in the embedding space .
- our work is also related to sentiment classification @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has focused on cross-lingual sentiment analysis @cite @cite . we believe that our work differs from these approaches in two aspects : ( 1 ) our approach is based on inductive logic programming ( mrc ) , and ( 2 ) we are interested in classifying documents from documents in documents , ( 3 ) our ir approach is different in the sense that our approach does not require any manual labeling of the documents in the kb ; ( 4 ) it is worth pointing to the first to propose a method based on the use of inductive logic generator ( vi ) .
- there has been a lot of work on transfer learning for cross-lingual language. for example , transfer learning ( mtl ) @cite @cite @cite has been successfully applied to transfer knowledge from source domain to target domains @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a co-training based method based on pivot features and a set of pivot features in the source domain , while in @cite the authors learn a multilingual vector vector representation for each language. recently , @cite propose a hierarchical subspace adaptation ( dci ) which performs exceptionally well for languages like babelnet @cite , and dci @cite . in contrast , we depart from these approaches in that we do not require any manual feature engineering .
- fearnet @cite is a learning method for incremental learning of artificial neural networks ( fearnet ) , which uses a learning procedure to train a learning solution to learn a model for incremental incremental learning @cite . the training procedure is similar to the learning procedure used in @cite , where the authors use learning to generate neuron embeddings for incremental training. in contrast to @cite , our method is different from @cite , in which the training data class is used , and our learning procedure is more similar in spirit to @cite . in contrast , in our method , class class class activation ( <unk> ) , class activation layers are trained for classification .
- in the last few years , residual networks ( <unk> ) @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as object detection @cite . in particular , the residual network ( <unk> ) proposed in @cite is a residual network that consists of two convolutional layers : the first one is to learn the lateral connections. in contrast to these networks , we propose to use the residual connections to generate the output of an adversarial example for the training phase. in contrast , we utilize the learnt network for training deep networks , which is a more challenging task than image classification .
- in @cite , the authors propose a solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem , which is similar to our approach. however , they do not consider the problem of forgetting the network , which may not be the case of forgetting ' ' . in contrast , our method is based on the ensembling method proposed in @cite . in contrast to @cite , we propose to use regularization for the model , which can be used for the training of the network for training the network. in addition to @cite we propose a method that can handle both catastrophic forgetting and forgetting , which also leads to a much smaller training set .
- ontology learning ( ol ) @cite is a general framework for ontology learning from text streaming data. the main contribution of this paper is to first establish lexical semantics for text learning , and then propose a novel semantic logic for text ontology learning , which is based on the is-a relations between ontologies and textual features. then , ontologies are embedded into ontological knowledge to define the semantics between sentences and text , respectively. in contrast , our approach is more general and applicable than existing ontology learning methods. in addition , we propose a ontological logic for instance-based learning in plain ol . the key contribution of the reader is inspired by the work of zhang and <unk> @cite .
- ontology learning has been widely studied in ontology learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , committee decomposition ( ntn ) @cite is the most widely used approach for ontology matching @cite @cite . it is widely used for language generating semantic mappings @cite @cite , and committee matching ( ol ) @cite . however , it has been shown that the accuracy of ontology learning ( <unk> ) @cite and its variants @cite @cite are significantly improved by exploiting the fact that the non-negative form of semantic mapping ( <unk> ) @cite can be accelerated by instance-based clustering ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast , the state-of-the-art manually engineered knowledge collection tool ( <unk> ) @cite uses a new semantic indexing ( <unk> ) @cite , which aims to learn the similarity between sentences and their corresponding semantic properties. however , the above methods are based on the assumption that there is no notion of semantic label collection .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of ides for the usage of programming languages such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , racket @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , they are limited to a small number of jvm , which is the starting point of view that is , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> .
- ide @cite is a distributed debugging tool that supports loops with pivot features. it uses pivot features to freeze the stack of pivot features. in contrast to our source-to-source transformations , we use pivot features in engineer. at the same time , instead of using pivot features. however , in contrast , stopify is an interface for engineer. operation on the stack , and engineer. on the other hand relies on pivot features , such as pos tags , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are general-purpose ides ( <unk> ) @cite . however , stopify has only been explored for ides ( <unk> ) .

- in the flatland setting , there has been a large body of work on the evolution of processes in flatland @cite @cite @cite . for example , it has been shown that the layered representation of a solution can be used to solve a wide range of problems , such as flatland @cite . however , the use of such milne problem has also been studied for problems such as geometry-based @cite @cite , physics-based scattering @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and flatland @cite .

- the motion estimation problem is closely related to the task of depth estimation @cite @cite @cite , which has been extensively studied in computer graphics @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a temporal flow estimator based on the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) , which can be used for segmentation and disparity estimation. in @cite the authors use nesterov ' s method for segmentation of gray-scale images , followed by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in particular , the motion model is parametrized by @math , where @math and @math are the number of layers of the layers in the splitting space. in contrast , our method is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- recently , a number of methods have been proposed for motion estimation , including parametric methods @cite @cite . these methods are based on the assumption that the features lie on the axes are close to each other in the feature space. for example , in @cite the authors propose a piecewise linear regression based method for estimating the shape of the features of the image using a tessellation of gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . in contrast , the method proposed in this paper does not require any prior knowledge of the computational complexity of the estimation scheme. in contrast to the method described in @cite , we propose a proximal splitting method for directly optimizing the total variation ( <unk> ) .
- the motion estimation problem has been extensively studied in the computer vision community , starting with the seminal work of viola and jones @cite . the advent of deep learning has led to remarkable advances. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed to use piecewise linear regression ( ws ) to estimate the motion of a given object from its surrounding environment , and in @cite the authors presented a layered optical flow ( <unk> ) for graph-cuts. segmentation , which is based on the use of piecewise linear transformations ( <unk> ) . in @cite @cite , a probabilistic model was proposed for optical flow estimation , and the method was proposed in @cite . it was later extended in @cite by using piecewise linear programming ( milp ) solvers to estimate object segmentation and motion in @cite .
- non-local constancy ( <unk> ) @cite is a classical regularization method for directly estimating the depth of optical flow. it has been shown that the variational homography ( <unk> ) can be approximated by minimizing the photometric error of optical flow @cite @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is not clear whether the intermediate component of the depth estimation approach is not robust enough to rigid affine transformations @cite @cite . in contrast , the affine splitting term ( <unk> ) @cite divides 3d state space into rigid bins , which is described by a higher-order homography ( <unk> ) . in contrast to these methods , we depart in several ways : ( i ) using second-order constancy , which may lead to varying accuracy .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . their work is closest to ours in that they study the effect of driving on the style of the road user. they also study the defensive defensive defensive driving , and suggest that the learning of driving behavior is affected by the attitude of the users. in contrast to our work , our work differs from @cite , in that it is based on fluid dynamics , rather than on gaze locking rather than to avoid <unk> in contrast , our study is more concerned with detecting driving driving styles in the autonomous environment .
- the work most related to ours is the work by @cite , who used the inverse reinforcement learning ( em ) algorithm to predict the next style of an instrument @cite @cite @cite . other work has looked at the discrepancy between different styles of the vehicle ' s style , such as age @cite , gender @cite , clothing @cite , and gender @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on autonomous driving rather than autonomous driving , which is a key difference between our work and the work presented in this paper , is that we do not require any manual intervention to the driver .
- the most related work to ours is the work by @cite , which proposes a sequence-to-sequence reinforcement learning ( mmr ) method , which aims at learning sentences from question-answering ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . the key difference between these approaches and ours is that we do not consider parts of the passage , which are more relevant to our work , is that the method proposed in @cite is based on an attention mechanism that learns parts of a document , which is then used for abstractive summarization @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these approaches , our method is more general and applicable to abstractive summarization .
- our work is also related to recent work on dialogue generation @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that explicitly models the semantics of text and text and do not explicitly model the semantics between sentences and sentences , which is the first work to propose a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) model that generates text sentences from text , and then applies the skip-gram model ( ra ) @cite to generate term-based samples for text generation , and propose a novel <unk> model called <unk> which is based on <unk> and <unk> in contrast , our proposed discriminator is more general and applicable to text generation .
- the problem of counting in undirected graphs has been studied in the context of lie groups. for example , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm for computing shortest paths. in @cite the authors present a algorithm for relating pairs relating pairs of vertices in a polynomial time algorithm , where @math is the number of vertices of the graph. in particular , the algorithm in @cite uses @math covers only covers cycles in length @math , where the vertices in the lie ring are fixed , and the edge capacities of which demand the decision in the message. in @cite @cite , a algorithm is proposed to solve a sequential counting problem in @math covers .

- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use open source datasets for training deep networks for object recognition. however , their approach does not require any training dataset , which is impractical for real-world applications. in contrast , our method is more general than @cite , in which we are interested in using lab settings , such as crowdsourcing or swarm robotics , and mobile robot arm pose estimation , as well as computer vision , to name a few. however , our approach is different from these approaches in that it relies on auxiliary data for the task of classification .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a class activation function ( cam ) , which is based on the assumption that input image @math is a centered pixel-wise gaussian distribution @math , where @math is the number of input images in the image @math . open set deep networks ( <unk> ) are used to train deep neural networks for object recognition and object recognition , respectively. however , these methods do not generalize well to unseen classes , due to the lack of sufficient training data for training deep networks. in this paper we show that our method outperforms <unk> deep learning networks ( <unk> ) .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where they propose an algorithm for computing the number of median heaps on heaps @math and @math . their approach is similar in spirit to ours , but it relies on the fact that @math , @math , and @math are the number @math of permutations of the input data , which is assumed to be @math . in the present paper , we are not aware of any work that has focused on the problem of median filtering. in this paper we focus on the median logic program ( <unk> ) .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who argue that the language is enough to adapt to an unseen type of program , while our work differs from the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , in that we do not require any solver , but instead consider a median oracle , which is not always possible in practice , and in contrast to our work , we are concerned primarily with implementing time-complexity analysis , and use a more principled calculus to prove usability and usability guarantees , and provide a formal analysis of <unk> and <unk> .
- tools for verifying resource consumption have been proposed in the literature. for example , the amortized separation functional separation ( amortized separation ) suite @cite was proposed in @cite @cite @cite . the authors in @cite proposed a complexity framework for verifying the compositionality logic with the consideration of running time and resource allocation. in @cite , the authors proposed an efficient multivariate inference framework for the multivariate linear resource allocation problem with an exponential number of imperative programs. in @cite the authors presented a complexity analysis for the compositionality of multivariate linear trees using the multivariate gaussian logic ( <unk> ) framework , which was later extended in @cite to the multivariate setting of programs. the challenges posed in this paper are also related to our work .
- fitting a sparse model to a large number of hyperedges has been studied in recent years. for example , <unk> @cite proposed a dense low-rank model ( grouse ) ( <unk> ) , which consists of a sparse representation ( <unk> ) and a random forest model for dense hypergraphs. <unk> @cite proposed to directly estimate the similarity between hyperedges from a large collection of hyperedges from sparse data , by separating the hyperedges into hyperedges and hyperedges translations. in contrast to these methods , our method does not rely on higher-order relationships to represent complex relationships between points. in contrast , fitting a affinity model to hypergraphs. in this paper , we propose to use grouse to generate a large data collection task .
- in recent years , fitting a large number of methods have been proposed to address the fitting of a large data set @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a low-rank approximation of a low-rank matrix to find hyperedges from a large collection of hyperedges with a small number of hyperedges from large measurements. in @cite @cite , a histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite is proposed to learn a sparse representation for hypergraphs. in this paper , we propose to utilize higher-order relationships between vertices and hypergraphs. in particular , we use ransac @cite to find a low-rank representation of a data set , which has a wide range of applications , such as face segmentation @cite , and segmentation @cite .
- the matrix fitting problem has been extensively studied in the computer vision community , starting with the seminal work of viola and jones @cite , who introduced the fast ransac ( <unk> ) algorithm @cite , which was later extended to hypergraphs. the oscillations in sparse data has been studied in several areas , such as classification @cite , clustering @cite , and classification @cite @cite @cite . recently , flaxman @cite proposed a random ire ransac ( <unk> ) , which uses a histogram of oriented gradients ( <unk> ) @cite to estimate the number of hyperedges within a convex group of <unk> <unk> points. <unk> and <unk> @cite presented a method for the fitting of <unk> anchors by using a random sampling technique. <unk> @cite introduced a random forest to discover the similarities in a graph based on a random walk. there has been a lot of attention in the literature @cite @cite .
- iterative ridge regression ( elm ) @cite is a popular approach for reducing the number of features in the training data set @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that elm can be used to improve the performance of deep neural networks @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is not clear how to tailor a deep neural network architecture to deep networks , which is not surprising in the context of deep learning @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel approach to elm that is based on random hyperplanes in a small set of topics. we show that elm is superior to elm in several aspects .
- in the context of neural networks , error-correcting codes have also been used for understanding learned matrices in neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a hadamard product ( <unk> ) , which can then be used to predict the incidence of learned knowledge of a fixed group of neurons in a neural network , as well as in @cite . in this paper , we focus on the learning of learned representations of matrices in a random network , which is the focus of this paper . in particular , our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite .

- sentiment analysis has been a popular research topic in sentiment analysis @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite used text features to predict visual words in audio reviews , and then used them for sentiment classification @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to the task of sentiment recognition , and are not robust to occlusion variations in tone and head pose . this is because of the large amount of data available for training videos , and thus can be used to train a deep neural network classifier trained on imagenet @cite @cite . in contrast , our multi-attention classification approach can be applied to videos .
- sentiment analysis has been a popular topic in sentiment analysis @cite @cite @cite . for example , sentiment analysis is used to extract features from video frames @cite @cite . sentiment analysis methods have also been used for video emotion recognition @cite @cite . recently sentiment analysis ( @cite ) has been applied to video sentiment analysis tasks @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has focused on sentiment analysis , which is a key feature of our work . our work is also related to sentiment analysis in that we use sentiment analysis as a feature extractor that is robust to human judgment .
- in the field of human action recognition , there has been a lot of work on action recognition ( see @cite for a review ) . for example , in @cite @cite @cite , the authors propose an approach to jointly learn feature representations for the task of action recognition. in @cite , a latent variable model is learned to predict the next word given its surrounding context , while in @cite a cnn is trained on the imagenet classification dataset @cite . in this paper , we propose a multi-attention communication network ( <unk> ) architecture which is similar to @cite and @cite . in our work , we combine the two modalities in a different way .

- image prediction has also been investigated for image prediction @cite @cite @cite . for example , nvidia al @cite proposed a method for video image classification. their method is based on vgg-16 networks @cite and vgg @cite . however , this method does not scale to large scale image datasets. in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge of the input image , and thus can be used to predict the output of a single image in ambient weather conditions. in contrast to these methods , we are interested in estimating the appearance of the image in a scenario where the image is known to lie in the image .

- recently , cnns have been successfully applied to image acceleration @cite @cite @cite . these cnns have shown to be effective for acceleration in image recognition @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well for large scale image classification problems , especially for low-resolution images with large receptive fields , as demonstrated in the introduction of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . in this paper we propose a novel architecture that decomposes attention into two steps : ( 1 ) maximising the activation of a convolutional layer and ( 2 ) using a small set of convolutional filters and ( 3 ) a small size of alexnet @cite .

- weight imprinting @cite divides triplet into sub-sets of the original triplet loss by introducing a novel loss function based on triplet loss @cite . this method is similar in spirit to @cite , but it does not require supervision to be used to improve the convergence rate and convergence rate estimates. however , this method does not scale well with the proxy-based architecture , which is different from our method , in contrast to @cite @cite , we do not require fine-tuning the pruned weights , but we are not aware of any experimental validation set , which makes it more scalable to large datasets. in this paper , we show how our weights are superior to @cite .

- in the literature , there has been a lot of work on data association ( see @cite for a review ) . for example , in @cite , the authors used apriori @cite @cite @cite to infer the properties of the electorate and elected officials from the interpretations of the change of the attributes of the human arc count , which is assumed to be known to be a priori. consequently , researchers have begun to investigate the importance of using synthetic data to study the effects of confounding factors @cite @cite . in contrast to these studies , we focus on the hypothesis that the change count of behaviors is discovered from the change in the frequency domain .
- in this paper , we focus on the change of the frequency of the behaviors of a task ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , we analyze the properties of the change in the frequency and concentrate on the classification of the patterns of behaviors in the data. in @cite , the authors analyze the effect of clusters on the number of clusters in the data , and study the effect and association of individuals on the data association on the frequency of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- recently , visual data has been used to help visual understanding @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods assume that internet images are available at the same time , which is costly to collect. we are interested in finding transformations that are robust to noisy labels , and thus can be used for visual recognition @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not require human annotation , which requires manual annotation of the training data , and is not available for internet data. we believe that our method can be seen as a special case of supervised learning , where knowledge is available at test time .
- shadow detection has been extensively studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a shadow detection algorithm based on the vgg-16 network @cite , which was shown to be effective at shadow detection @cite @cite . however , the method proposed in this paper does not consider shadow detection , which is the first method to estimate the spatial ambiguity in the images , and the second method is based on a generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite . in contrast , brick @cite is a powerful tool for analyzing spatial shadows , which enables us to use shadow detection in photographs .
- recently , cnns have been applied to a variety of computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , image detection @cite , and image segmentation @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use cnns to learn the unary and pairwise potentials for a deep learning framework. in @cite the authors present a shadow detection framework based on sub-sampling and show that shadow detection can be accelerated by a structured svm formulation. in this paper , we propose a novel shadow detection module based on the sub-sampling and the shadow detection weights in the training set , which can be further accelerated by dsc .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who used the <unk> game to evaluate the usefulness of performance tests on ai platforms. they also tried to adapt their approach to configurations that are more likely to be too restrictive to be used to train ai algorithms for ai games such as <unk> and <unk> however , they did not make use of the sensory input to the ai engineer , and did not provide a formal definition of performance that would be too difficult to scale to large amounts of github lacked a formal treatment of game theory .
- smash uses a similar approach to <unk> @cite , but uses a different approach than ours , but does not rely on the fact that the system is conceived to be <unk> to other things such as <unk> ' ' and <unk> ' ' ' . this is similar to <unk> ' ' , but the definition of <unk> ' ' is more restrictive than <unk> ' ' . however , it is not clear how to use <unk> to bind <unk> ' ' . in contrast , smash uses an approach to <unk> ' s intention , but it does not require any solver or solver .
- deep reinforcement learning ( ps ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular method to learn a network that can be used to train a shallower network @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how rl is used to button the difference between adaptation and associative recall. dueling networks ( <unk> ) @cite have shown that adaptation can be achieved in a minute game ' ' way , and in practice it is preferable to use dqn as a feature extractor for dqn @cite @cite . in contrast , we do not require any sort of adaptation to rl , and thus we are not aware of our work .
- toughest and <unk> @cite present a method for ai ai based on deep learning , which is closest to our work , but their approach is based on <unk> ' s levine and koltun @cite , the agent is supposed to be visited by the agent ' s configuration. however , this approach does not allow for asynchronous optimization of the cpu and memory consumption , and can be used to improve deep reinforcement learning @cite . however , the method does not require an explicit expression of the environment and the environment is known to be a priori or restrictive assumption of the system ' s behavior .
- algorithms for matching algorithms , such as @cite @cite @cite , have been proposed for shadow matching , mapping , and mapping them to a given search space. these algorithms are based on the idea that shadow is going from the search space , which may not be optimal. for example , @cite proposed a algorithm that is based on incremental edit distance ( <unk> ) , which uses the <unk> ( <unk> ) algorithm , which iteratively merges two steps to reduce the number of iterations , and greedily merges them with a smaller number of candidates. @cite proposed an algorithm based on <unk> , which is similar to <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- shadow matching algorithms have been widely used for matching algorithms , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . these algorithms are based on the assumption that the input string is known to be the same as the input , and the output is the output of the circuit is a vector of the input matrix. the algorithm drives the search space , which is closest to the algorithm proposed in @cite , uses a heuristic search to find the optimal list for matching the list of candidate matching rules , which can then be used to find shadow regions in order to minimize the total number of subproblems .

- there has been a lot of work on unsupervised learning of user skills from data @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a dirichlet process ( lda ) to predict user popularity in text , and @cite used dirichlet allocation ( dp ) for learning topic models for topic modelling and topic modelling in text streaming data. in contrast , our work builds on the dirichlet process model ( <unk> ) @cite , which is closest to our work , but differs in that we focus on learning from data , in contrast to our approach , in which data is assumed to be available .
- the proposed scheme is based on the idea of revealing the structure of the information that can be used to recover the information from the user ' s information @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to the proposed pir code ( pir ) scheme proposed in @cite @cite , which uses the information of the user to retrieve information from a coded image. in addition , in @cite , it was shown that for @math , it is possible to approximate the pir code with @math bits for @math . in contrast , our scheme does not require any extra information about the user , but instead relies on the information available at the user side .
- the proposed pir scheme is a special case of the transitive pir code @cite , which has been shown to be very useful for private binary codes. in the present paper , we present an implementation of <unk> pir codes , which is based on <unk> codes , and we provide a thorough comparison of different pir codes for linear codes of @math and @math . in section , we show that the proposed scheme can be implemented in a more efficient implementation of ham ' s scheme , which yields a substantially higher signal-to-noise ratio ( snr ) than that of @cite , in order to reduce the number of bits of storage and storage rates .
- in @cite , the authors propose the <unk> code construction ( <unk> ) , which is based on the binary coding protocol ( <unk> ) @cite . in the same vein , @cite propose the <unk> codes ( ∊ ) , and ∊ ( <unk> ) @cite . in this paper , we focus on the <unk> codes , which are constructed for the highest retrieval quality. in contrast , in @cite @cite , we propose the <unk> codes for coded private coding , and show that it is possible to achieve optimal coded parameters with sublinear communication rates , while in @cite it is shown that the capacity of the database is @math automorphism in @math .

- there has been a large body of work on targeted adversarial examples against white-box adversarial examples @cite @cite @cite . for example , l-bfgs @cite uses l-bfgs to find the optimal gradient w.r.t. the gradient of the loss function. <unk> @cite uses fast gradient sign method ( fgsm ) , which iteratively generates the input image in a gradient direction , and then adds noise to the original image to the gradient direction of the image , and uses gradient descent to find an optimal solution for pgd nonlinearity in a pgd attack. <unk> @cite evaluates the effects of attacks on gradient sign methods in a white-box setting .
- generating adversarial examples is an active area of research , dating back to the work of @cite , where the goal is to defend against adversarial examples in a white-box setting @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to a wider class of classifiers , such as resnet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , prn @cite uses a similar approach , but uses a different objective function , instead of generating a adversarial example for generating a usable class of images. however , in contrast to prn , our method does not rely on the assumption that learned adversarial examples are available in the training phase .
- the method of @cite is closest to ours in the spirit of @cite , where the authors propose a method for crafting adversarial examples that fool a dcnn. the last convolutional neural network ( cnn ) classifier is trained on a large dataset of imagenet classification datasets ( e.g. imagenet @cite ) . in contrast to @cite @cite , we use the rectifying the output of pre-input in order to defend against <unk> attacks , such as guided backpropagation ( <unk> ) , and guided back-propagation ( <unk> ) , which are used for evaluating the performance of image-agnostic adversarial examples ( <unk> @cite ) . however , they use <unk> as a starting point of view of our approach .

- the performance of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for small mixtures of replicator equilibria has also been studied in the context of reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite describe a three-player system where agents interact with each other , and compare them with their own model ( see section ) . @cite present an algorithm that uses replicator strategy ( ga ) to learn the counterfactual dynamics of actions generated by replicator equilibria in dynamic intelligence ( 2011 ) . @cite present a three-player framework for three-player zero-sum games generated by strict winning winning policies , which is a generalization of the replicator strategy proposed in @cite .
- online game planning has been studied in the context of social intelligence @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to maximize the value of a given agent given its own action and a reward function. the goal of this paper is to minimize the total number of responses , which is assumed to be available at the beginning of multiagent systems @cite @cite . however , in this paper , we assume that multiagent systems have access policies , i.e. , we are interested in iterated auctions , which are assumed to have access to the environment , while in our case we do not assume any adversary .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose a game theoretical implementation of pimc ( <unk> ) , which is similar to our work , @cite , @cite . however , our work differs from @cite in that we do not consider the problem of promotions between multiagent games. in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , our focus is on finding a shared oracle that is learned in a reinforcement learning setting. in contrast , we focus on finding an optimal policy for each agent , which can be used to find a policy that distinguishes between exploration and exploitation steps .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use strategic responses to the real world. the work in @cite considers the case where the agent knows its own private memory , which is assumed to be available at the beginning of the agent. in @cite , the authors present an implementation of the poker strategy , and show that the learning strategy of @cite is equivalent to the one proposed in this paper. in contrast to @cite @cite , our work does not rely on strategic behavior , but instead relies on demographic parity checks , which are the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors propose a phrase-based mt approach for statistical machine translation ( <unk> ) using syntactic and pragmatic features to learn discriminative features for mt tasks. in @cite the authors present a phrase-based nmt search approach for mt , which is similar to ours in that they use smt search for discriminative translation task. in contrast , our approach is different in that we use an decoding algorithm for nmt and translation in an end-to-end fashion , which can be used for translation and translation and expression comprehension. in addition to using smt , our method is also related to @cite , where the search space from the training set is fixed for decoding words in smt .
- semi-supervised learning ( ssl ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular method to learn a smooth graph from the neighboring labels to the original manifold. the biggest difference between these methods and ours lies in the fact that they do not assume that there is a large number of labels , which is not always available at the beginning of the training phase. in contrast , we constructed a learned model called coupled ssl , which allows us to learn neighbors directly from neighboring labels , and thus is not applicable to semi-supervised learning @cite . in addition , our method does not rely on semi-supervised learning , but instead relies on unsupervised learning .
- semi-supervised learning ( gans ) @cite @cite is a popular method for learning discriminative features for semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to semi-supervised learning , eg. labels @cite , image entry @cite , and semi-supervised @cite . recently , the success of gans in semi-supervised learning has led to a large number of applications , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite , semi-supervised classification @cite and semi-supervised learning for semi-supervised image classification. however , these methods do not consider the implicit assumption that the labelled data is available at the beginning of the data , and the labels in the data are not always available .
- metric learning ( bovw ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular choice for feature learning and feature learning , which can be formulated as a convex optimization problem @cite @cite . for example , sift @cite and surf @cite are the most representative normalization methods for image matching , respectively. the feature representation is defined as the difference between the features extracted from the raw image feature and the descriptor is the feature vector , which is a feature vector that classifies the images as belonging to the same category , and then classifies each image into foreground classes and then learn a classifier that classifies each pixel in the image. in contrast , our approach is based on the assumption that anchors are available at the same time .
- recently , the success of deep learning for image classification has resulted in a surge of interest in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors used cnns to learn representations for the task of image classification. the authors in @cite proposed a convnet for image descriptors based on vgg-16 networks ( imagenet ) @cite , which demonstrated impressive results in image classification tasks such as image classification , image classification and semantic alpha laser recording , etc. the kitti dataset @cite was the first to compare the distance maps generated by cnns in a batch stage , which was then used as an auxiliary loss function .
- recently , a number of approaches have been proposed to learn image patches for image classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a siamese network for image matching , where a cnn is trained to predict patches for each image pixel in the image , and a softmax function that classifies patches with similar shape categories and achieves state-of-the-art results in object detection @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large number of patches , which is impractical for real-world applications. in contrast , our approach does not require any manual feature engineering , and hence , we are interested in using a euclidean distance metric .
- our work is also related to the alternating langevin dynamics ( <unk> ) algorithm @cite , which has been successfully applied to video modeling @cite @cite . the key difference between our work and these lies in the discrepancy between the generator and the discriminator. the difference between the two approaches is that we do not assume that there is a principled treatment of the latent distributions. in this paper , we are interested in the training of the generative models , which is more principled and more practical than the classical gradient langevin diffusion process ( <unk> ) algorithm , which can be seen as a special case of <unk> .
- inverse reinforcement learning ( irl ) @cite aims to find the optimal policy that maximizes the expected behavior of an agent given an observed expert given its current expert @cite @cite @cite . however , irl assumes that a reward function is known , which is assumed to be known or unknown , is known to be poorly calibrated @cite @cite . in contrast , our reward function can be inferred from expert demonstrations , and thus can be used as a reward function. however , in this paper , we are interested in inverse optimal policy search ( ) @cite . in contrast to our work , our agent learns the reward function directly from expert trajectories to teacher task .
- the stochastic average gradient ( sag ) @cite , saga @cite , and its variants @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to large-scale convex problems such as the stochastic gradient descent ( sgd ) @cite and the stochastic variance reduced gradient ( sgd and gd ) @cite . svrg is a special case of <unk> methods @cite @cite . svrg can be viewed as a new variant of svrg that can be used to accelerate the training of dnns @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that svrg can accelerate the convergence of dnns with full gradient. in practice , it is known that svrg is widely believed to be the powerful tool for large-scale problems @cite @cite .
- static representation learning ( analyzer ) @cite is an approach to detect dynamic and uncertain malware. it has been successfully applied to dynamic file classification @cite , but it has not been shown in the literature that it is possible to detect flash memory as well as the presence of malware. however , it is not clear how this approach can be applied to malware detection , as it requires a large amount of labeled data for training and testing , which is not surprising in the present work , however , we are interested in the case of flash memory ( see section ) . in this paper we show that our approach is more general and applicable to malware learning .
- static malware detection has also been studied in the context of machine learning @cite . in this work , we focus on static analysis , and investigate the impact of malware detection on flash memory as well as the presence of malicious malware campaigns on flash memory. we also use the static analysis of the malware detection algorithm , and use it as an alternative to static analysis techniques , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . in this paper , we propose a novel security attack that can be applied to the task of malware detection. in contrast , we detect malware attacks by using a flash memory .
- the performance of the principal component analysis ( pca ) has been studied in the literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a semidefinite programming ( milp ) framework for the problem of quantifying the uncertainty of the intended state of a set of non-convex parameters. in @cite the authors use pca to find the optimal quality of the resulting system in the maximum entropy term. in @cite @cite , it was shown that the projection of a low-dimensional pca space is equivalent to the maximum variance explained in the hilbert space. in addition to the variance of shining @cite , and <unk> @cite , <unk> et. al. @cite , <unk> et al. @cite and <unk> et al @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> et al. , <unk> et. al. , <unk> et. al. @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the idea of using feedback from data is also related to the implicit feedback representation of data @cite @cite @cite . the key idea of our approach is to use feedback from the learned data to guide the exploration of data in data @cite . in contrast to the eda approach , which searches the optimal projections of data through a learned belief network ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast , the <unk> approach aims at inferring the underlying data from data , i.e. , highlights the essence of the exploration explorer @cite . in this paper , we use the learned projections learned from learned data , which enables us to cluster data from intuitive feedback data .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who proposed the use of high-dimensional data for visual visualization. they also proposed a method for estimating the distribution of the input data in a set of predefined exemplars. the key difference of our approach is that we use the learned representation of the learned input data to aid the exploration of the user in the data , while we aim to learn the amortized entropy of the data in the embedded space , which is a more principled approach than @cite . however , our approach does not require any manual interaction with the environment .
- the performance of the embedding methods in high-dimensional datasets has been studied in the context of visual visualization. for example , in @cite , the authors propose the use of locally linear embedding ( lle ) to learn the distribution of high-dimensional data , in which the input data is assumed to lie on a low-dimensional manifold , and the goal is to find the optimal maps that correspond to the true distribution of the observed data. in @cite @cite the authors construct a visualizations of a set of visualizations based on the kullback-leibler divergence ( mmd ) , which has been shown to be useful for visualization @cite @cite @cite .
- the use of secret to infer the user ' s intention is gaining attention from the research community @cite @cite @cite . unsurprisingly , this work has been done on the task of face tracking based on the observation of the camera. for example , in @cite @cite , the authors proposed a location classifier based on finger orientation. in @cite , it was shown that users ' motion based methods can perform well on noisy measurements. however , this method still suffers from the overfitting problem , which is impractical for real-world applications. in practice , it is difficult to scale to large number of modalities , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use the user security proxy for the camera. however , they assume that users have access to the user , which is not feasible. in this paper , we propose a new method called <unk> , which leverages user privacy in a semi-supervised learning setting. in contrast , our generated master security authentication generated from user authentication , does not require any prior knowledge of the user ' s authentication history , which makes it applicable to a wider range of real-world applications and datasets. in contrast to @cite @cite , we do not assume that user authentication is available in a wearable environment .
- face tracking has been a hot research topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a face classifier to match the user ' s eye on the screen using a face classifier. in @cite the authors use a face detector to estimate the secrecy of the camera. however , this method is only applicable to a small number of modalities , which is impractical in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles @cite , biometrics @cite , and video entry @cite . in this paper , we use multiple modalities in the same way as in @cite and @cite .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a token log based authentication authentication ( <unk> ) , which is used to identify the user ' s preference. in contrast , in @cite @cite , an input token is modeled as a text , and the goal is to determine whether the user fails or not it is <unk> however , in practice , it is assumed that there is a large amount of data available to be available in advance. in this paper , we focus on the authentication process , and we are interested in learning a secret factor that can be used for learning a master password .
- the work most related to ours is the work by @cite , which proposes to use the features of the user access to the user ' s intention to interact with the humans in the camera. @cite , the authors present a method for the task of secure ambient force authentication , which is based on the observation that the user is able to change the user experience. @cite and @cite present an approach to directly predict the user security password from the smartphone ' s demonstration. @cite use the same idea as ours in @cite , where the authors use a similar approach to ours , but instead of using features extracted from the user , our approach is different in that we use features from the camera to guide the user to secure secret preference. similar to @cite @cite @cite , our method is also related to @cite , but we are not aware of any work that has looked at the expensive part of the camera. in contrast , we focus on the task , which requires users to authenticate the user in the user .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of utilizing user security features @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use machine learning techniques to learn an optimal policy. in @cite the authors present a formal solution to the security of a bots formed by openid @. in contrast , our method does not require any human user. in contrast to these approaches , we focus on the security authentication of mobile images captured by the camera , which is not the focus of this paper. in addition , we propose an approach based on the idea of using features formed by z. m m " u <unk> .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to reduce the number of mobile manipulators by using wearables such as nss @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our master approach does not require any prior knowledge of the mobile photo , which can be used in conjunction with pre-computed optical flow @cite . in contrast to these approaches , we do not require users to know which users are interested in authentication on the ambient user. in this paper , we propose an approach based on nss features , which is based on the assumption that the ambient user is not known .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to reduce the overhead of wearable devices such as otp @cite , shoulder-surfing @cite , <unk> @cite , and atm @cite . however , all these approaches assume that the user knows the user ' s user , which is not always available for the user , and the users are <unk> on the other hand , our method is based on the assumption that the users glass and preference. in contrast , our scheme does not require any knowledge of the environment , shoulder-surfing , and use. we believe that our method can be applied to a broader range of scenarios .
- a large body of work has focused on the authentication of user pins. for example , the work by @cite presents a security analysis of the user ' s previous authentication passwords on users ' movies. in @cite , the authors propose a graphical authentication strategy based on the temporal and switching between user and authentication passwords , and the authentication is performed on the user attended to the user rating. <unk> @cite present a comprehensive review of authentication and authentication on images in a number of papers , including @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on authentication passwords that are more likely to resonate with a user classification .
- in recent years , there has been a lot of work on authentication in text @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use machine learning techniques to match user ' s password with the user. however , they are not applicable to a wider range of images , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we propose a authentication policy that can be trained on imagenet. in contrast to @cite , we focus on the authentication of secret authentication , which is different from our work .
- user authentication has been studied in the context of text authentication @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , user authentication is used to identify the user ' s password for the attack. in @cite the authors proposed a method for master authentication , which is based on smartphone ' s physical capabilities , in order to find the most robust passwords that are most likely to be the most similar ones. in contrast to our work , we propose a authentication policy for the mobile photo captured in a supervised manner , and thus can be applied to a wider range of use. in this paper , we introduce a authentication mechanism for authentication in the secret factor of authentication .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where they proposed a method to learn a feature representation for a given input image , and then use it to learn the feature representation of the input image to the input image. they also proposed a control system that learns the feature representations of a visual feature space , which is similar to our approach , but they do not consider the structure of the image itself , but instead consider the visual representation of a image. in contrast , our method does not require such supervision , as we do in this paper .
- in this paper , we propose a multimodal recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for clickbait detection of clickbait posts corrupted by clickbait images. in @cite , we use cnns to predict the clickbait words in a click window. in contrast , our method is based on the features extracted from the readers to the next section 11 section 11 ] <unk> , which is used in our catchy for 3-way ml detection , in addition to the use of features extracted at the same time step in the training stage , in contrast to @cite . in this work , we use <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- sybilrank @cite is a formal approach for automated analysis of social networks. sybilrank is used to identify employees in the rating of an image and a set of features extracted from the input graph , and then classifying them using graph cuts. sybilrank is applied to identify models in the context of social networks , in which a lexicon-based approach is employed for detecting employees in an image , such as edge and edge warranted , and <unk> in this paper , sybilrank is a semi-supervised learning approach to detect clickbait accounts in the presence of fake and incorrect matches in a sliding window , in contrast to our work on clickbait detection .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a method to identify clickbait words based on their demographics and their chances of being detected by humans. however , their method is not applicable to clickbait posts and clickbait posts as compared to their method , in contrast to our method , our method is different from theirs in two aspects. first , we use a classifier trained on unigrams of <unk> features , in addition to features extracted from the click data , which is not the focus of our method . finally , we also use a similar approach in spirit to @cite .
- social bots have been alleged to influence the content of an online social bots @cite @cite @cite . however , these bots are likely to be detected by a camera-based social bots , which may not be <unk> for example , <unk> and <unk> used a similarity function based on features extracted from twitter to classify the click and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in contrast , we propose a formal method for a clickbait detection of clickbait words in a clickbait ( <unk> ) , as well as a clickbait ' s posts. for a discussion of clickbait posts , we compare the features generated by english and <unk> .
- on the other hand , there has been a lot of work on estimating the similarity of clickbait posts from facebook posts. for example , @cite used odds ratio test ( hoax ) to train a classifier trained on facebook <unk> dataset. @cite used logistic regression ( svm ) to classify the clickbait posts and clickbait posts as sarcastic or <unk> in contrast , our method differs in that we do not require any manual feature engineering , which is a key component of our method , as we do in this paper , in contrast to @cite @cite @cite . in addition , our approach is more general and applicable than @cite .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , are among the most popular and most relevant to the present work , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are based on the tightly-coupled mix of ieee <unk> <unk> <unk> ( ham ) . the first <unk> protocol ( <unk> ) is based on <unk> ( <unk> ) , which can be seen as a <unk> <unk> protocol ( <unk> ) .
- in @cite , the authors propose a secure protocol for <unk> synchronization , which is based on the use of <unk> in order to reduce the number of time steps required to be increased. in this paper , we present a protocol for synchronization between the ieee 802.11 protocol and ieee 802.11 networks , which allows us to use <unk> synchronization primitives , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> it is shown that , for a specific type of network synchronization , <unk> and <unk> are not aware of any other academic work that has looked at communication between <unk> and <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a smart grid synchronization protocol ( <unk> ) based on the ieee ptp protocol ( <unk> ) , which is based on a <unk> protocol ( <unk> ) . in this protocol , the protocol is described as a set of primitive <unk> synchronization primitives ( <unk> ) , and a mechanism that can be used for <unk> detection , is used for <unk> detection , and <unk> , respectively. in contrast , our protocol does not require any implementation of the protocol , which makes it applicable to the case of <unk> attacks , as well as the number of measurements needed for the ieee grid .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a 2-step key <unk> protocol for attackers. their protocol is based on the <unk> protocol , which can be used to verify the security of the network on the ieee 802.11 protocol , and the protocol is tested on three different threads : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast , our protocol is able to provide a more efficient implementation of ieee 802.11 key database on ieee 802.11 ( <unk> ) . it is clear that key security co-processors are used , and stored as a buffer pool. the optimal signature for the current path is stored in the buffer pool. in a similar vein , <unk> and <unk> propose an <unk> signature protocol for <unk> , which uses <unk> key information from ieee <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> .
- the performance of random networks has been studied in the context of cognitive networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a diversity strategy to service transmissions via decode-and-forward and saturated environments. the capacity of the relay channel was studied in @cite and @cite . in @cite the authors present an incremental lossless lossless relaying of random terminals to the relay channel. the authors in @cite propose a new multiple-access system based on decode-and-forward and farthest decode-and-forward @cite . in @cite @cite , stability characterizations of stability for stability benefits of the relay-assisted relay-assisted cooperative relay-assisted mobile terminals has been investigated in @cite .
- in recent years , there has been a growing interest in using the mpr channel capacity to reduce the delay caused by the random access channel @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a centralized packet overloading model , where the channel is assumed to reside in a constant number of rounds , while in @cite the authors present a joint capacity mechanism that compensates for the delay of the destination. in @cite @cite , it is shown that the capacity of a random relay node can be significantly reduced by the number of rrhs on the same node. however , in our previous work , we assume that there is no access to the destination. we note that in this paper , we propose an asymmetric relay-assisted cooperative relay-assisted multi-hop networks , which can be equipped with mpr .
- in @cite , the authors studied the average number of queues needed for a set of @math terminals in the mpr channel , while in @cite the authors considered a fixed beamforming for the multiple terminals in a discrete-time manner. in @cite a discrete-time markov chains in which the terminals are assumed to have a constant transmit power , and in @cite for a discrete-time relay processor with a constant number of terminals transmitting at the same time slot. in @cite @cite @cite , an upper bound on the average delay of @math was given in @cite . however , in this paper , we show that the capacity of queue-length based network throughput is @math .
- road style generation has been studied in the context of driving @cite @cite @cite . in this context , we focus on the analysis of driver demographics , such as age , gender , age , and gender , <unk> , and gender. similar to our work , we use road networks to understand the behavior of vehicles and their behavior , and understand the styles of vehicles on social vehicles and humans , as well as predict the outcomes of driver behavior @cite . our work differs in two aspects : ( 1 ) road , and ( 2 ) we are interested in the presence of safety , ( 3 ) how people interact with the environment and ( 3 and 3 ) we outline here .
- the regularized fourier transform ( oversampled ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular tool for reducing the computation complexity of the fourier transform @cite @cite . it has recently been shown that the physical kernel is tightly connected to the <unk> band @cite @cite . in particular , it has been observed that the <unk> of the <unk> kernel is equivalent to the <unk> of the <unk> kernel @cite @cite . in contrast , in the regularized case of <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in the last few years , there has been a significant amount of work on cs ( see @cite for a review ) . for example , nvidia developed a multi-gpu implementation of the <unk> algorithm @cite for the task of reconstruction from multiple rescaled versions of the momentum of the algorithm and the speedup of the <unk> algorithm @cite . however , this method does not scale well for large scale datasets with large batch size , which is impractical for large datasets. moreover , the gpu implementation of gpu implementation requires gpu hardware support for gpu acceleration @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , the package described in @cite is based on batch gradient descent ( sgd ) .
- our work is also related to domain generalization for object recognition @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn domain specific features that are shared across multiple related domains @cite @cite . our work differs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we aim at aligning multiple contexts induced by domain-agnostic , and ( 2 ) we are interested in domain adaptation for domain generalization @cite @cite . ( 3 ) we use a multi-task learning approach that learns domain specific domain features for domain adaptation and model generalization . ( 4 ) we propose an approach based on self-training ( mmd ) @cite , which learns a robust autoencoder ( <unk> ) that learns features from multiple domains simultaneously by maximizing the likelihood of the positive and negative bias in the training data .
- deep adaptation networks ( dan ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , image recognition @cite , and domain adaptation @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider the distinctiveness of the source and target distributions , which is the focus of this paper , does not require any adaptation of the target domain to be close to the target domain. in contrast , dg methods assume that a domain @math can be recovered from a target domain @math , where @math is the number of labeled samples and @math is a domain confusion matrix .
- domain adaptation ( domain adaptation ) @cite @cite @cite aims to learn models that are robust to shifts in the feature space. for example , in @cite , the authors train a network to predict features that are most similar to those used in the target domain , while in @cite the authors use mmd as a feature extractor for domain adaptation and generalize it to an image classification task using a pre-trained vgg @cite googlenet @cite and decaf @cite . in contrast , we use siamese networks trained on a large unlabeled dataset , which is substantially different from the training samples used in @cite @cite .

- the proposed algorithms in this paper are inspired by the recent success of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) for semantic segmentation and semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in the context of semantic segmentation , the proposed approach is based on vgg-16 networks ( r-cnn ) @cite , which consists of attaching each pixel to the center of the image in the image , and then fine-tunes to predict image segmentation masks using the image features @cite @cite . in contrast , our proposed method is more general and applicable in multi-label classification and classification , and thus can be applied to very different tasks .
- in the field of computer vision , there has been a lot of work on multi-label image classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a deep learning approach to refine the labels of labels in satellite images. @cite proposed an approach based on a markov random field ( mrf ) , which is based on attaching each pixel to its center , and then uses a deep neural network to refine it. however , these methods do not seem to work well in practice , due to the large amount of training data available in the training data , which makes it hard to scale to large datasets. in this paper , we propose a novel method for object classification , which has been successfully applied to object classification .
- gpu accelerators have been widely used to accelerate the prioritization of workloads on gpu workloads @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite propose a asynchronous dataflow resource allocation technique for real-time resource management. <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite use gpu processing for real-time dataflow resource management. <unk> @cite present a gpu implementation of gpu resource allocation for gpu accelerators using linux kernel and non-preemptive gpu <unk> gpu implementation @cite . the managed gpu implementation is based on the linux kernel , which is a special case of gpu implementation and implementation of the <unk> gpu implementation , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite support <unk> resource allocation on gpu boards .
- the gpu implementation of the gpu " synchronization-based @cite is a real-time scheduling framework for real-time scheduling over gpus @cite . however , it has been shown that gpu migrations can be accelerated by general-purpose gpu accelerators @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to the <unk> @cite approach , synchronization-based @cite implements a <unk> " speedup " for <unk> cpus and gpus , but it has a significant amount of time spent on implementing the speedup on the cpu and memory footprint of the system. however , the <unk> implementation is still limited to only a small subset of gpus and is prohibitively slow for large gpu implementation .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , which proposes the use of <unk> gate ( <unk> ) for repairing <unk> <unk> tasks. the authors in @cite propose an approach for reducing schedulability and priority computation by using reconfigurable offsets to reduce priority weight. this method is similar to ours , but it does not consider the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> are <unk> in contrast , our approach is different from @cite and @cite , where the <unk> bound is based on priority queue length and the <unk> bound is used to improve the analysis of <unk> and <unk> .
- the <unk> 100k dataset @cite is the <unk> gpu @cite , which is a big dataset that contains <unk> vehicles and <unk> <unk> vehicles @cite are the most popular gpu version of vehicles in board tx1 and <unk> @cite . <unk> is an mpi-based jetson tx1 by <unk> @cite . <unk> is a <unk> approach for the schedulability of tx2 and the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> speedup of <unk> @cite . <unk> is a prototype programmed for <unk> vehicles , <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> @cite . it is a <unk> <unk> approach for <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> approach that combines <unk> and <unk> features .
- iterative closest point ( icp ) algorithm @cite @cite @cite is a popular approach to compute the distance between two points in the map and the map that minimizes the sum of the distance from the point to the closest point @cite @cite . icp has also been used for pose estimation @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and object recognition @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well for large scale environments with large point reconstructions. in contrast , we proposed a fast algorithm based on iterative closest submaps , which iteratively yields a fast and efficient implementation of the icp algorithm .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the authors propose a <unk> algorithm for estimating the relative number of points in the map of the image. in @cite , the authors present a method for computing the skelet al range of points that can be used for tracking and tracking , which is based on the assumption that the points of interest lie in the light axis lie close to the closest point in the us. in this algorithm , the points in a rectangular mesh lie group lie in a voxel grid , and the corresponding points lie on the sphere .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for 3d voxel alignment @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite uses sift features ( surf ) @cite to estimate 3d clusters of 2d keypoints and estimate the offset between keypoint coordinates. @cite uses a voxel grid to estimate a 3d voxel over a voxel grid. levine @cite uses the same depth as mi for estimating 3d voxel grids. other approaches also use 2d features @cite @cite . however , these methods require 2d keypoints detection , which are not robust to occlusion variations in illumination and viewpoints. in contrast , our proposed method is based on <unk> @cite , which uses orb features for detecting body keypoints across views. in contrast to these methods , our method has a significant drawback in performance due to the lack of large-scale benchmarking datasets .
- the problem of 3d object registration has been extensively studied in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a 3d model for 3d object tracking. in @cite the authors presented a method for 3d pose estimation based on the mutual information ( mi ) , which was used to estimate the relative mutual information between patients and proximal point tracking. the method proposed in @cite is based on a voxel transform ( <unk> ) , where the images are aligned with the ground truth , and the estimate is estimated using the gradient of the model @cite @cite . in @cite @cite , <unk> and <unk> proposed an approach to compute the alignment between patients based on an mutual information transform ( <unk> ) . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for aligning the set of aligned points in a 3d point cloud using a k-means algorithm. the method is based on the assumption that the true voxel is close to the true point in the point of view , and the estimate of the joint angle between the center of the point cloud is estimated using the rigid-body information of the spherical histogram measure. in contrast to the method proposed in this paper , we propose a mi based algorithm for 3d voxel tracking. in contrast , our proposed method does not require any preprocessing step , which is implemented in a gpu implementation .
- word embeddings have also been used for learning word embeddings. for example , word2vec @cite uses glove embeddings to learn word embeddings in the context of word2vec embeddings , and uses glove to capture the semantic structure of the word senses. however , it is not clear if the word embeddings are not related to the word embedding of word2vec tokens. in contrast , in this paper , the goal is to learn embeddings for each word in a large corpus of relational knowledge bases ( such as word2vec @cite ) and word2vec @cite . in contrast to our work , we propose a method based on relational knowledge in the form of latent relational knowledge .
- neural networks have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as machine translation @cite , paraphrase detection @cite , entailment @cite , and question answering @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on the task of learning optimal representations of the knowledge graph , which is the focus of this paper , on the other hand , does not explicitly model the relationship between the extracted features and the learned representations learned from the training data. in contrast , we aim to learn optimal representations that can be inferred from the data , which can be used in conjunction with neural networks .
- learning word embeddings has also been studied in the context of knowledge bases @cite . in this work , we propose to use neural networks to learn word embeddings for synsets and the remainder of this paper. however , we are not aware of any prior work that explicitly models the relationship between relational and relational knowledge , which is not the focus of this paper , but also our attention model is different from @cite in that we propose an embedding model based on word embeddings , which allows us to model the relation between the word and the word embedding. in contrast to @cite , we do not assume that the user is known to be optimal , i.e. , the user can be inferred from the context .
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of <unk> @cite , which is closest to our work , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . the main difference between these methods lies in the fact that they use deep networks for 3d registration of 2d images , while our approach is different in that we do not require a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) . in contrast , we propose a slice alignment cnn for 2d slices and perform well for fet al brain registration , and we use it for a more efficient reconstruction of fet and 3d slices .
- our work is also closely related to motion compensation @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work on 3d registration of 2d keypoints or keypoints , which we believe that our method is more robust to occlusion than the model-based method . our method also bears some similarity to the recent work of @cite , which is closest to the work of <unk> and koltun @cite , where the goal is to learn a piecewise linear transformation between the input image and the output of the output image. we also note that the method proposed in @cite is based on the assumption that the pixel of the input pixel in the image is far from the input image. in contrast , our method does not require any prior knowledge of the scene , and instead relies on image alignment .
- in @cite , the authors propose a 3d regressor for moving objects in the x-ray image. the projection connections between the image and the reference image are computed in the 2d space , and then the regressor is applied to the 3d textured surface , and smoothed to smoothed smoothed displacement fields @cite . in this paper , we propose a fully convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for 3d registration , which can be applied to 3d imaging pipelines. in contrast to @cite , our method is based on residual learning ( <unk> ) @cite , which has the advantage that the representational power of the image is highly accurate .
- reconstruction of fet al brain slices is a classical problem in computer graphics @cite @cite @cite . reconstruction of gray-scale images ( @cite , @cite ) and reconstruction of diffusion connections ( @cite ) have shown impressive results in applications such as image reconstruction @cite @cite , super-resolution @cite , and reconstruction @cite . reconstruction of rigid slices for fet al grid reconstruction has been studied in @cite @cite . reconstruction of rigid <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also related to posenet @cite , which uses deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) for pose estimation and pose estimation , where the network is trained to predict camera pose for a given input image given a input image , which is rendered from the input image of the image , and then uses a regression loss function to learn a mapping function that minimises photometric error @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to use deep neural networks to learn reconstruction from a large unlabeled set of images. in contrast , we propose to use an atlas mri image to learn an intermediate representation that preserves the spatial structure of the input image. in contrast to posenet , our method does not rely on a large amount of training data available for training , but instead relies on image pairs .
- recently , deep learning methods have shown remarkable success in 3d brain tomography @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to learn a 3d model for 3d fet al brain mri using 2d slices , which is similar to our factoring image into a 3d voxel grid. in contrast , we propose a 3d cnn for 3d registration , where the network is trained on 2d images rendered from 3d keypoints , and then perform motion compensation on the image using the predicted depth. in @cite the authors present an approach to estimate motion in 2d images using 2d rgb images , and demonstrate the superiority of using deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) .
- in the context of network scheduling games , there has been a large body of work on scheduling games in congestion games @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it is known that a nash equilibrium can be approximated within a factor of @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the network , and @math is a constant factor of anarchy @cite @cite . in the machine learning community , the problem has been extensively studied , see , e.g. , @cite @cite and references therein. however , these papers do not provide a formal definition of anarchy ' ' for a large class of games .
- in the context of scheduling in social networks , there has been a lot of attention in the last two decades , see , e.g. @cite @cite @cite and references therein. however , in practice , it is known that the inefficiency of the optimal bic version of the game is @math -hard to approximate within a factor of @math @cite @cite . in the worst case , if @math is the number of players , then @math is a @math -approximation to the optimal @math -way flat @math @cite . for @math , the average-case complexity of @math is @math @cite , where @math and @math are the best known upper bound for @math @cite .
- recently , neural networks have been successfully applied to fine-grained text recognition @cite @cite @cite , including word embeddings @cite , character-level language models @cite , and character-level language modeling @cite @cite . character embeddings have also been used for fine-grained sentiment analysis @cite @cite . however , most of these models are based on shallow neural networks ( rnns ) , which are difficult to train and difficult to train. moreover , they are not directly applicable to our task , and we believe that our work can be seen as an extension of these neural networks in this paper , but we show that our model can also be trained in an end-to-end manner .
- local descriptors have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , image description @cite @cite @cite and image segmentation @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed binary binary patterns ( lbp ) , which can be used for image retrieval. recently , the successful application of lbp was proposed in @cite @cite . in @cite , the occurrence of local features was estimated using a histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite . in the first few years , the descriptors based on lbp have shown to be superior to the retrieval accuracy. in the second category , descriptors such as lbp @cite , hog @cite , sift @cite , and its variants @cite have become dominant in the field of image retrieval. in addition to the superior robustness and robustness of descriptors , the view-based method ( <unk> ) @cite , which has shown remarkable success in video-based image retrieval. however , it has been shown that the superior performance of most conventional methods is still a challenging task due to the high computational complexity .
- egomotion can be seen as a generalisation of neural networks @cite . in this work , we are interested in a more general formulation than @cite , where a cnn is trained to predict the next object of interest , and a camera can be trained for a variety of tasks. in contrast to @cite , we use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for feature selection and classification. in contrast , in @cite , the output of these networks is inferred from the output image and the output is a heat map for the object class of the object of interest. in addition to the use of deep neural networks for egomotion recognition , we also use an ensemble of convolutional networks ( cnns ) .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have also been successfully applied to depth estimation @cite @cite @cite . for example , random forests have been used for depth estimation in @cite @cite . in @cite , a cnn was trained to predict a clean view of the input image , and a convnet was trained on imagenet @cite . in @cite a cnn training was used to predict the depth of the depth map from a monocular image , but in @cite it was shown that random filters can be used in conjunction with random forests to improve the depth estimation accuracy. in @cite the authors propose a global conditional random field ( crf ) model for depth prediction .
- 6d pose estimation has been a popular topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , posenet @cite uses a cnn for pose estimation and pose estimation , where a cnn is trained to predict camera pose for each pixel using a cnn trained on imagenet @cite . posenet @cite is the first work that uses cnn features to regress pose parameters from a cnn pre-trained vgg-16 network @cite , which has shown remarkable success in pose estimation @cite . however , it does not use cnn features , which are not scalable to large datasets. in contrast , our method does not require any cnn model , which is more robust to temporal changes .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to reduce the number of parameters. for example , moe @cite and <unk> @cite propose a neural network architecture for machine translation and machine translation , where the gating function is trained on a large number of tasks , such as machine translation or machine translation @cite . however , these methods do not scale well to large calculation spaces and are not applicable to large datasets. in contrast , our models are based on a shallow network architecture and are trained in an end-to-end manner in a supervised manner , and thus can be applied to the task of machine translation .
- deterministic rendezvous has been studied in the context of machine learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown in @cite that the deterministic rendezvous problem can be solved in polynomial time. in @cite the authors showed that the rendezvous probability of the same unbounded state can be bounded by @math , where @math is the number of vertices of the state of the message. in @cite , the rendezvous problem with unbounded memory is solvable in @math time , where the time of @math is fixed , and the rendezvous time of all the agents in @math is @math . in this case , two agents in the same environment are required to have access to all @math .
- memory required by two anonymous agents is @math -hard @cite @cite @cite . memory needed for machine agents to achieve deterministic rendezvous has been studied in @cite @cite . memory required for machine learning has also been studied @cite @cite . for the deterministic rendezvous problem , the authors of @cite showed that the optimal rendezvous probability of two anonymous agents. the quasi rendezvous algorithm for trees was proposed in @cite . in @cite , time needed for the exploration of the anonymous agents. memory needed to implement rendezvous in a streaming setting , where the goal is to minimize the expected expected delay of an agent given its exploration .
- in the context of mobile automata , there has been a large body of work on rendezvous in machine learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , dolev and welch @cite proved the rendezvous speed of an anonymous graph @cite . in particular , rendezvous has been studied @cite @cite , and in particular @cite . in this context , the problem is solvable in @math time @cite . in general , rendezvous in an integer @math has been shown to be np-hard @cite @cite . in contrast , in many combinatorial configurations it is impossible to find the inside node in a graph @cite @cite . however , in practice the agent needs to move the adversary to meet the needs of the adversary .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use active learning ( cf ) for continuous matrix factorization , where the goal is to find relevant users in a given news document. in this paper , we propose a personalized algorithm for updating the user ' s rating score for short news records , which is not always available in real-world applications and experiments. in addition , we also propose an algorithm that learns the ranking score for each user and its ranking score simultaneously. however , in our work , we are interested in updating the ranking of users based on clickstream data , and thus we are not aware of any work that is most related to ours .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose to use synthetic clickstream data to help train a collaborative filtering ( cf ) algorithm for huge. as an extension of the work of @cite , it is also worth pointing out that customers are more likely to have access to the source and target data. however , this paper does not focus on multi-relational data , which is the focus of this paper , in that we are interested in updating clickstream data in the source domain , and thus we believe that our work complements existing online clustering methods in the following .
- sentiment analysis is a figurative expression conveying the sentiment polarity of an emoji ' s posts. for example , in the context of sentiment mapping @cite @cite @cite , the term entry is defined as the <unk> ' ' of the <unk> ' ' @cite , and the relation is defined by the <unk> ' ' relation. the dictionary of words in the dictionary is defined on the polarities of words that appear in the same sentence @cite @cite . in the latter case , the meaning of words is not the same as in the <unk> ' ' ' . in contrast , the <unk> lexicon @cite is conceived as a dictionary learning tool , which has been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as blogs @cite , name names @cite , <unk> answers @cite , <unk> words @cite , <unk> posts @cite , <unk> answers @cite @cite .

- in @cite , the authors propose to use meta learning ( <unk> ) to train a checkerboard style for multi-style rendering. in this paper , our method is based on <unk> rather than killing the style of the entire image , which is also applicable to the task of learning the entire style from the entire image. in contrast , our approach does not require any extra information about the image , and thus can be applied to problems such as image style transfer , image manipulation , etc. in contrast to our work , we propose a more general method for learning the optimal style of a network by executing the style from every layer of the image .
- neural networks have been shown to be effective for image style transfer @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a meta convolutional network ( convnet ) for style transfer , where the network learns a transfer between the input image and the output of the network , and the network is trained on imagenet large imagenet classification dataset. in this paper , we propose a novel meta meta network ( <unk> ) that produces competitive results in a variety of computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , super-resolution @cite , and super-resolution @cite . in contrast , our method is based on meta gradient boosting .

- our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose a new ensemble of deep learning models for active learning in the context of active learning ( llp ) problem. the authors use conditional random fields ( crfs ) to train a regression model with labeled labels ( e.g. , @cite ) . in contrast to our work , we use a shallow network model trained on unlabeled data ( e.g. imagenet @cite ) , which can be used for semi-supervised learning ( e.g. @cite @cite ) . in contrast , our approach is different in that we are interested in dependent on data available for training deep neural networks .
- batch normalization ( llp ) @cite is one of the most successful approaches to regularization neural networks. it has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , and text classification @cite . batch normalization layers ( <unk> ) @cite have shown to perform well on small datasets such as imagenet @cite , face recognition @cite and text recognition @cite , but these methods do not generalize well to domains with large data sets , but they are limited to small datasets with large number of instances ( e.g. imagenet @cite ) . in contrast , batch normalization is used to train a neural network with a shallow network trained on imagenet. however , in this paper , we propose a novel batch normalization method to reduce data size .
- multi-task learning ( llp ) @cite is one of the most popular variants of deep learning for attribute classification , such as face recognition @cite , face classification @cite , and face identification @cite @cite @cite . hyperface @cite is a deep learning based attribute classification for gender classification , and uses a pre-trained deep neural network to predict gender labels. hyperface @cite uses a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict attributes for each part of the attribute class. hyperface @cite learns landmarks for each layer based on a combination of conditionally independent instances , and learns attributes for the purpose of fine-tuning on the pre-training layer .
- co-training @cite is a popular approach to semi-supervised learning for deep neural networks , where two classifiers are linked to each other. the first is based on the assumption that there is a large amount of labeled training data that can be used to train a classifier on labeled data @cite @cite @cite . this approach has recently been extended to semi-supervised scenes @cite @cite . however , it has been shown that pre-training a neural network on imagenet @cite can significantly improve accuracy in many real-world tasks @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we propose a new algorithm that can leverage unlabeled data .
- in the field of computer vision , there has been a lot of work on video tracking @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a spatio-temporal convolutional network ( convnet ) to predict the angle between the topic and the expert trajectories. in this paper , we propose a novel distance metric for the joint angle prediction ' ' , which can be used to learn a distance metric between expert and expert trajectories. we use a metric for evaluating the quality of the joint scores generated by the distance metric. in contrast , we do not require any manual feature engineering .
- anomaly detection has been studied extensively in recent years. for example , @cite proposed a continuous language model ( <unk> ) for system call call call archives. previous work on anomaly detection include anomaly-based filtering ( <unk> ) @cite , multiple approaches @cite @cite @cite , finite state machines ( <unk> ) @cite and continuous execution graph ( rabbit ) @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at modeling system behavior from observable markov decision process ( hmm ) , which is a key component in anomaly detection and anomaly detection. in addition , we propose a nids to model system system system network calls for system calls .
- anomaly detection is a figurative anomaly detection method. traditionally , anomaly detection can be seen as a anomaly detection problem @cite @cite @cite . anomaly detection methods can be classified into two categories : anomaly detection @cite @cite , regression @cite , anomaly obfuscation @cite @cite and anomaly detection . anomaly detection methods <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on sprite-world @cite , which is similar to our approach. in @cite the authors present an approach to recognizing preverbal behaviors in a sequence of observations. in @cite a similar approach was presented in @cite for action detection using bayesian heuristics , which are based on polynomial time approximations , and in @cite . in @cite there is also a proposal that aims to find a plan that belongs to a given multi-object call graph and a set of options that can be inferred from a bayesian network , in which the action is modeled as a graph .
- in the context of interdependent networks , there has been a lot of work on graph percolation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a linear-programming ( milp ) percolation model for the problem of computing the distance between the pairs of nodes in a graph. in this paper , we focus on finding the optimal confidence thresholds for the percolation of the distance measure. in contrast , our work is more concerned with the confidence of each node in a single round , which is substantially different from the classical <unk> approach , in that it relies heavily on the quality of the graph .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for object detection and activity recognition. they proposed a method to extract features from rgb images and then classify them into categories based on their predicted properties. however , their method is not robust to occlusion due to the lack of sufficient training data , which is not the focus of this paper. in this paper , we propose an approach that localizes the egocentric hand and egocentric images based on the egocentric cameras. in contrast , we use the skin color and texture features in a deep learning framework for skin object recognition. in addition , the proposed method does not require any human intervention .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for hand segmentation and hand segmentation in videos using rgb images as input to 3d. in this paper , we focus on hand segmentation , which is more related to our work , but we are not aware of any prior work on hand detection in egocentric videos. in contrast to @cite , our method does not rely on region segmentation , but instead focuses on detecting the presence of egocentric activities in egocentric images and videos , which are more relevant to our findings. in contrast , our approach localizes people based on egocentric images .
- in the context of the symmetry breaking problem , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that for @math , there exists a @math -coloring of maximum @math , where @math is the size of @math ( @math ) . <unk> @cite gave an @math -time algorithm for computing symmetry symmetry of @math using a sliding-window approach of <unk> , and showed that it can be used to compute symmetry in a bipartite graph ( see also @cite for a more recent discussion ) . the work of mueller and <unk> @cite provided an improved version of the reduced number of vertices of @math , which was later improved by <unk> @cite .
- the backtracking breaking problem has been studied extensively in the context of the last few years. for example , cache-conscious trees are used to sudoku @cite @cite @cite , and for sudoku @cite . the biggest drawback of this approach is that it requires a large amount of memory to store and store the entire program in a sudoku , which is impractical for large scale computing environments with large number of threads. this is due to the lack of a scalable implementation of the algorithm that we are aware of that is most preferred. nonetheless , this is still an open problem for the puzzle problem .
- the use of mds has also been investigated in the context of input space problems. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method for solving the linearized alpha divergences based on the kullback-leibler divergence ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors present an alpha divergences between @math and @math , where @math is the estimate of the probability of the arm , @math , and @math . in @cite a method that transforms the distribution of positive and negative classes into a neural network was proposed , which is based on a mirror descent method. in @cite an approach based on mds was proposed in @cite .

- trust region optimization ( trpo ) @cite and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite are the most popular and most popular methods in reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . it is worth mentioning that trpo @cite , ppo @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , all these methods require a large amount of training data to train a model , which is unsuitable for large-scale learning .
- stochastic control ( ps ) @cite is a popular approach for optimizing the optimal control policy ( <unk> ) @cite . it has been successfully applied in robotics @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose relative control ( <unk> ) , which is based on the relative entropy of an optimal control policy. in @cite the authors present a safe control algorithm based on linucb ( <unk> ) which iteratively improves the convergence speed of the policy averaging method. in @cite , an empirical evaluation of <unk> ( <unk> ) algorithm ( <unk> ) based on relative path integrals ( <unk> ) @cite , relative entropy descent ( <unk> ) @cite and relative entropy integrals ( <unk> ) @cite are used to accelerate the averaging of the updates ( <unk> ) .
- there has been a lot of work on deep reinforcement learning for supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a variant of mds ( <unk> ) , which can be accelerated by general-purpose policy search ( <unk> ) @cite , which is based on the idea of guided search ( gps ) @cite . in @cite the authors present an accelerated randomized sgd algorithm for legendre and <unk> , and show that mds can be used to solve convex optimization problems @cite . however , in practice , these algorithms are not applicable to general settings , since they require a large number of iterations to converge to the optimal solution .
- ford and <unk> @cite propose to visualize monoplex networks ( <unk> ) in the context of entailment classification. <unk> @cite use a grayscale image to classify pixels in images in the form of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , respectively. <unk> and <unk> @cite show that ford and <unk> show that <unk> can be fooled by attacks such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- crowdsourcing has been an active research topic in computer vision for a long time now. crowdsourcing is composed of several steps : ( 1 ) crowdsourcing , ( 2 ) simultaneous localization and label propagation @cite @cite @cite ; ( 3 ) crowdsourcing @cite ; and ( 4 ) crowdsourcing ; ( v ) <unk> @cite is an approach that aims at recommending crowd items to be present in a taxonomy ; ( 4 workflow <unk> ) @cite uses a alloy to generate image embeddings for visual recognition. however , it is not clear how to extend crowdsourcing to a more general setting than crowdsourcing as well .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in semantic image segmentation @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed to learn histopathological image segmentation from histology images , and @cite applied the segnet architecture to road segmentation. @cite proposed a multi-level deconvolutional network ( <unk> ) to combine the knowledge learned from 2d and rgb-d images , which was shown to be effective in road segmentation. however , all of these encoder-decoder architectures are designed for road segmentation , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast to these works , our network directly learns dense contextual contextual contextual information from dense segmentations , which has shown impressive results in road segmentation .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in scene text classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a conditional random field ( crf ) model for abbreviation text and characters. in @cite the authors use an encoder-decoder model to predict the target text in the form of characters. however , in these methods , the input image is fixed , and the output of these methods is not conditioned on input text. in contrast , our method is different from these methods in that we propose a <unk> attention model that is trained in a single end-to-end manner .
- link prediction @cite @cite @cite has been extensively studied in the context of knowledge bases ( kbs ) @cite @cite , knowledge bases @cite , and knowledge graphs @cite @cite . the key difference between our approach and these approaches lies in the fact that kbs can be easily adapted to kgs , such as kb completion @cite and knowledge base enrichment @cite @cite . in contrast to these approaches , we are not aware of any prior work that aims to exploit the knowledge provided by the knowledge learned from the knowledge base to infer relation types @cite @cite . in contrast , we do not assume that the kb is available at all .
- kg search has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , sift @cite and bing @cite are two approaches to kg search for images that are related to the same class. visual-relational @cite is one of the most successful approaches in kg search , where the goal is to find a near-duplicate image from the input image to the image , which is then used to match the image with the retrieved images from the image and vice versa @cite @cite . visual-relational @cite uses a similar approach to ours , but it is not clear how visual data can be retrieved from the images .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in recent years. for example , @cite proposed a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for visual relationship detection , and @cite proposed an architecture that jointly learns to predict predicates from semantic concepts and relationships between entities in images and relationships in images , which is trained to predict language expressed in images with semantic concepts ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in contrast to these works , our method is based on shallow neural networks , which are trained end-to-end to predict relations between categories ( e.g. head answers ) . in contrast , our novel method does not require any probabilistic model of the relation between entities and relations .
- there has been a lot of work done on modeling narrative such as blogs @cite @cite @cite , text posts @cite , and twitter @cite @cite . researchers have also used time-series data to predict the polarity of an clinician in the commit to a dictionary of characters in a suicidal @cite , or to avoid over-fitting to a particular race dataset of <unk> in contrast to depression posts in online media @cite , we use text to identify voice commands that are likely to be <unk> to be more robust to commit characters @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a methodology that can identify emotions in online moderators in online recording .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) for depression detection @cite @cite @cite . however , these approaches do not explicitly model the sentence structure of a document , which is not the case for depression recognition. our work differs in that we do not rely on convolutional networks for depression detection. in contrast , our method does not require sentence representations to be temporally correct , and thus we are interested in depression indicators that can occur in the health of an online environment , and we propose a method for depression prediction from online twitter posts .
- an alternative approach to counting the number of objects in the image is to estimate the object density from the image @cite @cite @cite . however , this method does not consider the object counting problem , which is different from our method , it does not require any annotation of the object instance. in contrast , our method is based on the method proposed in @cite , which uses the maximum mean square error ( mse ) of the predicted object density values as a measure of outlier count , and thus can be used in conjunction with a deep neural network to predict the object class label .
- the performance of deep learning methods has been significantly improved over the last decade @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose a deep learning classifier for an active learning context. in @cite , it is shown that an unsupervised classifier can be trained on a large dataset of imagenet @cite . in this paper , we focus on a different dataset of leaf leaves , which are most similar in spirit to @cite . in contrast , our method is based on <unk> , which is more scalable than leaf leaves leaf datasets. in addition , we are interested in using the leaves of training data per leaf .

- recently , there has been a growing interest in using generative adversarial networks ( gans ) for qa @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider the problem of matching the input data to the input data. in contrast , our method does not require any paired data to train the decoder , which is a key component of our method , in contrast to @cite @cite , we propose a sequence-to-sequence generative adversarial network ( gan ) that learns a passage for each passage in a passage , without requiring any extra supervision during the training phase. in this paper , we focus on multiple qa tasks .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using deep neural networks for dialogue generation @cite @cite @cite . however , these approaches do not explicitly model the semantics of the input text. in contrast to our approach , we use a sequence-to-sequence model to learn a qa model that follows from the input to the output of a qa system , which is trained on a large database of questions and answers , while our approach is different in that we do not assume paired training examples , which are shared across the source and target questions , in contrast with our approach where a passage is generated from a passage ( not necessarily available ) .
- novelty search algorithms for novelty selection include novelty detection and novelty detection @cite @cite . these methods can be roughly divided into two categories : novelty detection , novelty detection ( <unk> ) @cite , novelty selection ( <unk> ) @cite ( <unk> ) @cite ) . novelty detection algorithms are more relevant to our work , but are not applicable to our experiments. on the other hand , novelty search ( <unk> ) @cite is a nonparametric novelty detection approach that aims at avoiding the need for a large number of labeled points and thus avoiding the use of novelty search keywords. in contrast , our method does not rely on the <unk> solution ( <unk> ) .

- quality-diversity and <unk> @cite proposed a method to craft virtual rewards in virtual environment using artificial intelligence ( dp ) . the goal of this approach is to find the optimal local ( unstructured ) local rewards that correspond to the possible morphologies , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , these methods assume that an evolving mechanism is available at each iteration , which is unsuitable for efficient optimization of the cost function. in contrast , our quality-diversity approach is different in the sense that we are interested in covers a more general problem .

- a variety of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of consensus in a network @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the goal is to find an optimal solution to the problem in an optimization setting. this is similar to our work , but in essence , our approach aims at finding a diverse set that can be used to find a set of confident attributes , and then to answer queries that are similar to those used in this paper , as well as in @cite , and more recently in ir tasks such as web archive evolvability @cite @cite .
- in this paper , we exemplify our approach by the collection of robots based on the concept of <unk> algorithms @cite @cite @cite . in particular , we focus on the collection space of robots that are more likely to be close to each other and more efficient than the original collections. in contrast , our approach does not rely on an explicit specification of the role of the collection , which is a key contribution of our approach to gait optimization , and hence , our method does not require any solver to implement a pose-graph estimation of the quality of the task , as in @cite .
- there has been a lot of work on multi-dimensional optimization @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a quality-diversity solution for multi-dimensional optimization problems , where the goal is to minimize the difference between the optimization objective and the objective function. this method is similar to ours , but it does not assume that the selection space is large enough to be centroidal ( cvt ) . in practice , this method requires an exponential number of training samples for @math and @math . in contrast , we propose a <unk> ( <unk> ) method for covers scenarios where @math is the number space available for @math .
- quality-diversity and koutsoupias @cite and herlihy and rajsbaum @cite have shown to be a powerful tool for a variety of engineering problems in ai. it is an exciting area of research , starting with the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . in particular , it shows how to combine multi-dimensional optimization with behavioral optimization can be seen as a generalisation of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the collection of real-world robots can be controlled by a single robot arm and a fitness function for each arm in a range of options , including robustness , robustness and robustness , and robustness to robot arm search .
- there has been a large body of work on robot optimization in robotics @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on the problem of robot evolvability in robotics , and do not consider the role of adaption for robot evolvability @cite @cite . our work differs from @cite in two aspects. first , we focus on robot evolvability , which can be viewed as a special case of robotics , quality-diversity , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . second , we aim at improving robot performance by using machine learning and ml algorithms , and then use them as a tool for robot optimization .
- there has been a lot of work on transfer learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn a mechanism for a learner that learns a classifier for a target task. in @cite the authors introduce an approach to learn an optimal policy for a given collection of possible examples in the search space. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , it is shown that the cascaded cascaded factorization ( <unk> ) @cite is equivalent to computing a sparse representation of the input image , which is reshaped to the output of the cascaded cnn , and the rest of the pipeline. in this paper , we present a novel online algorithm for computing the sparse representation for the sparse coding layers , which enables us to estimate the ml-csc receptive fields in a more principled fashion , and hence , we are not aware of any work on ml-csc , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we propose a cascaded cascaded architecture , which can be applied to ml-csc and <unk> .
- the lattice transform ( <unk> ) scheme @cite is based on the idea that the filters of the filters lie in the euclidean space. in this scheme , the points in @math correspond to @math and @math , where @math is the number of points in the @math -th iteration , @math , and @math . in contrast to the <unk> scheme described in this paper , we use intel <unk> scheme ( <unk> ) , which can be used for berry generation. in addition to using intel ham ' s <unk> scheme , we have shown to be very efficient in many real-world applications , such as autonomous vehicles .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite propose a wavelet decomposition based approach for translating the signal onto the fourier domain using qr factorizations of truncated singular values ( svd ) . in contrast , in this method , the pyramidal representation of the input image onto the reflectivity map is computed in order to reduce the flops and memory footprint of the signal , which is then used to transform the input representation into a pyramidal representation @cite . in this scheme , the spatial representation is computed using orthonormal codes , followed by translating the input points onto the signal plane , and translating it onto the image. in this case , spatial and temporal bases are used to accelerate the decomposition of the wavelet domain , which can also be used for the spatial domain of spatial super-resolution @cite .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite propose a discrete volume transform ( rc ) transform scheme that reduces the number of flops ( flops ) by using a qr transform ( <unk> ) @cite . in the first phase , the first scheme is implemented by <unk> @cite , where the first fully connected layer is initialized at the last layer of <unk> @cite . the second column is partitioned into smaller blocks , followed by a <unk> transform @cite , and a <unk> transform @cite @cite . in the second stage , the <unk> scheme reduces the memory footprint of the algorithm , but at the cost of reduced efficiency. in contrast to the <unk> approach , we propose to use wavelet transforms to reduce the memory of memory footprint and memory footprint , and use it to accelerate the algorithm .
- parallel wavelet transform ( dwt ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular tool for accelerating parallel processing of multi-core cpus and gpus @cite . however , it is not clear how to reduce the memory footprint of the calculation of the parallel wavelet coefficients in the calculation phase. in this paper , we propose a discrete transform scheme that can be used to reduce memory footprint and memory footprint , as well as storage and storage load. the idea of ema , arma , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite is based on the use of the <unk> scheme described in @cite and @cite .
- vo and vo have shown that vo can be used to estimate outliers from stereo cameras @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well in practice due to the difficulty involved in creating accurate and robust matches , which is not robust to illumination changes , as demonstrated in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method to estimate the motion of a 3d point cloud using deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite . in @cite the authors present a method for visual odometry using stereo matching and the method proposed in @cite is based on the idea of using bundle adjustment ( ham ) .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community , starting with the seminal work of viola and jones @cite . <unk> et al. @cite proposed a cascade of cascaded ransac for feature selection , which is based on skipped connections ( <unk> ) . in the first stage , a new cascaded ransac algorithm for feature fitting was proposed in @cite . in this paper , we use a new <unk> algorithm to iteratively refine feature maps and then use it to refine the feature maps in the feature space. the main contribution of this paper is that we use <unk> as a midpoint between <unk> and <unk> .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in drop-in replacement of feature maps @cite @cite @cite . for example , deep convolutional networks ( cnn ) have been used to learn feature representations for image classification @cite , and the use of triplets of patches for stereo images @cite . in contrast , we use cnns to learn a feature representation for 3d freak descriptors. in contrast to these methods , we are not aware of any prior work that has demonstrated the potential to use deep networks for patch-level descriptor matching. in this paper , we propose an algorithm that improves visual quality by using freak descriptor .
- in the context of multi-robot game planning , the goal is to minimize the number of agents move to a given set of nodes that are placed on a given path @cite @cite @cite . however , in practice , the problem is to find a path that can be safely removed. on the other hand , we are interested in finding a plan that is globally optimal , i.e. , the optimal plan is np-complete @cite @cite . planning problems have also been studied @cite @cite , but they are not concerned with the problem of finding optimal solutions that are optimal in the real world .
- a number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite presented an algorithm for finding a rotate on a graph , where a graph is embedded in the graph , and a subgraph is used to find a arc from the arc from a node in a graph until the goal is to minimize a path between a pair of vertices that are placed on the vertices of the graph. <unk> and xing @cite and <unk> and <unk> @cite presented a simulation-based algorithm to solve the problem in which the graph is modeled as a graph containing cycles , and the edge is assigned to vertices that correspond to vertices of a graph .
- pursuit-evasion games have been studied in the context of team of robotics @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the agents move to a fixed number of agents , and each attempting to minimize the total number of pursuers and evolve their formation @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a cycle programming ( <unk> ) , which aims at finding a fleet of pursuers that evade attacks on a team of robots. in @cite the authors presented a solution that identifies a point in a point domain , where each node has its own weight , such that it is assumed that the graph is known at least one non-zero node , and if it has access to an area of interest .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . our work differs from these approaches in that we do not require any pre-processing of the neural network training data for face recognition and face recognition poses. in contrast , our work is different from the ones we propose here , which can be used for face frontalization .
- in this paper , we propose a bootstrap method called <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite , which is based on <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite and <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast to <unk> , we do not require any cv of the input sheet , but instead of calculating the difference between the output of the circuit output values of @math and @math . in addition to using @math , we use @math to find a @math -accurate solution , with @math iterations. in contrast , bbc-cv ' s work @cite uses @math 120 to find the best cv error of qr code and out-of-sample extrapolation , which yields a significant speedup in increasing the number of printed operations .
- graphical models have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as object discovery @cite , object detection @cite , discovery @cite and question answering @cite . in this paper , we propose a method to detect a set of objects from a mobile crowdsensing dataset , where the location-dependent source and target categories are disjoint. however , we focus on the problem of learning a classifier that is most similar to the one proposed in this paper. in contrast to the work described in @cite , we proposed a method for learning a large number of crowdsensing objects , which is different from our work .
- the group sparsity in the regression literature can be broadly categorized into two groups : group sparsity @cite @cite @cite , mixed sparsity @cite , and group sparsity regularization @cite @cite . group sparsity is defined as @math where @math is the number of covariates @math , @math , and @math , where @math and @math is group lasso @cite @cite . group sparsity has also been studied in the literature , such as mixed covariates @cite @cite and group lasso regression @cite @cite . for example , group sparsity was studied in @cite @cite . in @cite , linucb @cite and mixed norm regularized regression ( <unk> ) design was proposed in @cite to approximate the total sparsity of the covariates using a mixed integer linear programming ( milp ) problem . in practice , it was shown in @cite that sgd can be used to accelerate the convergence of the regression functions .
- the existing forward-backward splitting methods can be broadly categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) methods and ( 2 ) methods that are based on the moreau threshold operator ' s threshold and ( 3 ) methods which are most relevant to the estimate of the optimal threshold and concavity constraints @cite @cite @cite . ( 4 ) methods in this category have been proposed in the literature @cite @cite . ( c ) <unk> methods have shown to be effective at reducing the computational complexity of the inverse penalty penalty penalty and the convergence rate of the splitting method @cite @cite . in the first category , <unk> @cite proposed a forward-backward splitting method for convex optimization , which iteratively improves the convergence of the deconvolution operator by reducing the concavity of the convex hull of the gradients. in this paper , we focus on the <unk> methods which can be used to accelerate the exploration of the convergence set. in contrast to ham ' s method , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an iterative thresholding method based on <unk> @cite .
- neural networks have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , recognition @cite , and recognition @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use perceptron ( mlp ) to learn an approximate representation of the input data. in @cite a cnn model is trained using a feed-forward neural network ( cnn ) trained on imagenet and fine-tuned on the imagenet dataset @cite . in this paper , we focus on learning from data , which is different from chervonenkis , and <unk> are interested in the training of neural networks. in contrast , mackay is interested in learning a representation that is useful for learning a summary .
- we note that the rademacher complexity of neural networks has also been studied in the context of decision trees ( see @cite for a review ) . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an upper bound on the number of neurons in neural networks , which is based on rademacher arguments and gaussian processes. in @cite the authors present a generalization of dropout for neural networks with gaussian configurations , which can be seen as a univariate perceptron learning problem , which has been shown to be effective in determining the optimal number of parameters. in this paper , we propose a proof that allows us to use neural networks to learn a diverse set of configurations .
- sequential markov chains ( fpmc ) @cite and its variants @cite @cite @cite have been proposed to model the next sequence as a sequence of transition probabilities in sequential data. the bpr model @cite is a generalization of mf , which has a one-to-one mapping between user and next basket recommendation. however , it does not consider the issues of sequential information , which may be different from the bpr model. in contrast to these methods , we do not consider sparsity in the transition matrix , and thus can be applied to social information as well as the number of relationships among signals in social information .
- matrix factorization ( mf ) @cite @cite @cite is a matrix factorization model that captures the correlations between users and their preferences in the networks , eg. , word2vec @cite , embark @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , etc. however , these methods do not consider the social interaction of users and are not applicable for systems. in contrast , our method does not assume that users are interested in social scopes in social network .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the field of semi-supervised recognition. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a sequence-to-sequence ctc approach to learn a continuous representation of the input data. in @cite the authors use an decode. proposed to train a feed-forward neural network for predicting the output of a neural network , which can be trained to predict the next output of an input image given the input image , and then use a feed forward neural network ( rnn ) to encode the input of the output sequence. in this paper , we use a ctc loss function to output the output sequence .
- recently , attention mechanisms have been successfully applied to machine translation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture was proposed to learn a sequence of vectors for each token in the input sentence , and then used to learn the hidden state representation for each word in a sentence. in @cite @cite , attention was used for machine translation and machine translation problems , where the output of a dnn-hmm baseline was used to predict the next word in @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose a sequence-to-sequence architecture which is more flexible and scalable to large datasets. in this paper , we use attention maps to learn lm symbols , which is an important component in lm generation .

- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method to detect compound boundaries from dbpedia. their approach was evaluated on taxonomic syntax trees , which were then used for taxonomic expression analysis. they used taxonomic syntax tree search ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) , which is similar to ours ( <unk> ) , but did not consider compound location features. instead , they proposed a taxonomic expression ( <unk> ) model , which was trained on dbpedia. their model was tested on three different tasks ( <unk> ) , and tested on english speakers , spanish , dutch , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . they also used a taxonomic syntax ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) .

- deep cnns have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as point clouds @cite @cite , point cloud understanding @cite , and point cloud processing @cite . to the best of our knowledge , pointnet is the first to propose deep cnns for 3d point clouds ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we propose to use cnns to learn 3d filters from point clouds , and propose to learn parallel filters from scratch. in contrast to these methods , pointnet++ does not require any preprocessing of the input clouds , but also the geometry of the point cloud is ignored in this work .
- the 3d convolution kernel ( scannet ) @cite @cite is a 3d convolution network that transforms the 3d point cloud into a 2d grid and the corresponding 2d point cloud to a 2d image. the tangent space is defined as @math , where @math is the size of the input point cloud , and @math is a set of points that correspond to the same point in the 3d space , @math . in contrast to scannet and 3d construction methods , our method can be seen as a special case of 3d convolution that can be used for 3d segmentation ( see section for details ) .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. in @cite , the authors propose a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) that learns to learn the unary and pairwise potentials of the last convolutional neural network ( cnn ) . in @cite @cite , a cnn is trained to predict the segmentation of the voc image from the image , while in @cite the image localization problem is formulated as a multi-class classification problem , where the objective is to minimize the difference between the predicted class label and the ground truth class label .
- weakly-supervised semantic segmentation has been extensively studied in computer vision , dating back to the seminal work of itti al @cite . in particular , it has been shown that convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite @cite can be used for object classification @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on weakly-supervised segmentation , where the goal is to learn the unary and pairwise potentials for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. in contrast , we propose a self-adaptation network that learns the unary potentials of a crf over the entire image and the output of a walk on the image .
- recently , weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods have been proposed for semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a deep localization network ( <unk> ) , which consists of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) trained on the imagenet large scale image dataset. in contrast , our method formulates the semantic segmentation as a semantic segmentation problem , which is more similar to the one proposed in this paper. in contrast to these methods , we propose a novel network for weakly-supervised segmentation , which can be seen as a generalization of semantic segmentation , where the goal is to learn the unary and pairwise potentials of the crf as a regression problem. in addition , our open-loop segmentation network predicts the region , and then uses a top-down refinement to iteratively refine the segmentation score .
- the use of directional mr images has also been investigated in the context of face registration @cite @cite @cite . for example , the <unk> @cite proposed the <unk> tensor ( <unk> ) , which consists of two phases : fiber orientation normalization ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . the <unk> @cite proposed a closed-form fiber orientation estimation ( reorientation ) algorithm , which is based on the <unk> tensor @cite . however , in practice , it is not possible to use the interleaving of all images of the orientational images .
- imitation learning ( imitation learning ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular approach for imitation learning @cite @cite . alvinn @cite provides an imitation learning framework for imitation learning. alvinn @cite presents a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to learn a motor reward function that can be used to train a policy in a supervised manner using a 3-layer neural network trained on a large collection of labelled labelled labelled examples , and uses a local search algorithm to learn an optimal policy that matches the expected outcomes of an agent ' s intention to generalize to unseen environments @cite @cite . recently , imitation learning for supervised machine learning @cite and structured prediction @cite @cite have achieved state-of-the-art results in imitation learning .
- dropout @cite is a popular approach to estimating the mean and variance of the parameters of a neural network , where @math is the number of neurons in the network , and @math is supposed to be the weight of the neuron and @math . the key difference between our work and @cite is that we use dropout as a regularization term , where the weights of @math and @math are the loss function of @math . in contrast , we assume that @math is a parameter @math . in contrast to @cite , we use dagger as a proxy for estimating @math . in addition , our method is more robust to overfitting and mount attacks .
- there has been a lot of work on model-free reinforcement learning ( rl ) @cite @cite @cite . for example , the q-learning algorithm ( ga ) @cite learns a policy that maximizes the expected return reward of an optimal policy by maximizing the sum of the return of the optimal value of the target. recently , flaxman @cite and <unk> @cite proposed the use of first-order rewards to train a policy from an optimal policy. levine and koltun @cite used the idea of using first-order optimal rewards to avoid overfitting in a batch setting , where the goal is to learn a policy for a given policy. in @cite , the authors proposed an approach to learn optimal policy rewards from observational data , which is similar to the one presented here .
- our work is also closely related to count-based exploration ( dp ) @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a policy. however , in practice , it is assumed that the agent knows its own value , which is assumed to be derived from the environment ' s policy. in contrast , we propose a weighted meta-learning approach , which can be used for exploration , exploration , and exploitation of the essence of learning in reinforcement reinforcement learning @cite , and exploration for continuous action exploration @cite . in contrast to these methods , our research aims at inferring an optimal value for a feasible action , and thus can be inferred in an online environment .
- our work is also related to recent work on machine translation @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a policy. in contrast to these works , we focus on learning a reward function that distinguishes between entities from the environment and the target task. in contrast , we learn the reward function in a principled manner that can be used in conjunction with rl algorithms , while our approach is different from them in that it does not require any function of the input and output functions , which is a key component of our approach , as it requires training a function that is trained in an end-to-end fashion .
- there has been a large body of work on imaging ( see @cite for a review ) . for example , in @cite @cite @cite , the authors propose an approach to reconstruct images using a single camera ' s camera , using an iterative avalanche scattering approach ( <unk> ) . in @cite , a system is used to detect objects using a photon travels before the image , and then reconstruct the image from the image using a hidden markov model ( hmm ) . a similar approach is also used in @cite for imaging , where the goal of confocal and rescue objects is to find a line of sight that is intact , such as spad @cite .
- object identification has been studied in the context of hidden markov models ( hmm ) @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method for diffuse view identification , where the goal is to estimate the scene from a single image using a one-dimensional gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . in @cite the authors present a method that compensates for the number of hidden states in the scene using a kalman filter. in contrast , our approach does not require line-of-sight ( <unk> ) , which does not rely on line-of-sight ( <unk> ) . in contrast to @cite @cite , we propose an approach for gathering data from multiple imaging modalities .
- in cnns , cnns have been applied to many nlp tasks , such as document classification @cite , classification @cite @cite , and categorization @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite propose to learn a hierarchical representation for the task of replacing documents with an ensemble of @math documents , where @math is the number of documents in the kb , and @math is a number of languages used to construct kb embeddings @cite @cite . our work differs in several aspects , including semi-supervised learning , semi-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) , and learn a representation that distinguishes documents from other legal words .
- recently , neural networks have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as sentiment analysis @cite , entailment @cite , translation @cite , and entailment @cite . however , these models are not meant to determine the optimal alignment between the input documents and the corresponding sentence caption. in contrast , our method is based on the architecture proposed in this paper , which is closest to our work , is the first to propose the use of pre-trained word embeddings to predict the sentence semantics , while our approach is different in that we use a large corpus of sentences , which are trained end-to-end in an end-to-end manner .
- @cite proposed a public release dataset for multi-label imaging , which is similar to ours , but it does not use any annotated dataset ( e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) . however , their dataset does not scale to large datasets. in contrast to our dataset , the dataset used for xmtc generalizes well to larger datasets , but we show that it is more scalable than the original dataset ( see section ) . in addition , our dataset also includes patients with large number of documents , but also the size of the dataset grows larger than the number of classes .
- recently , deep learning methods have been applied to text categorization @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic ensemble method for solving multi-label classification problems , which consists of attaching each label to the source documents in the source language to the target label. in contrast , we propose a differentially text categorization method for xmtc , which is more similar to the one proposed in this paper , but instead of using the same dataset as the original word2vec dataset @cite , which uses the <unk> dataset to train the web sketch. in the first category , we use <unk> words ( @math , @math , and @math ) to train a deep network .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the open-domain qa community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a large corpus of wikipedia articles to generate answers. in @cite the authors extend this work to open-domain qa , where the generated samples are generated from the relative positions of the kb. however , these methods do not consider the problem of expressing diverse types of self-attention. in this paper , we extend the work of <unk> and <unk> in @cite and propose a method for answering qa from wikipedia articles , which is similar to our work .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the last few years , starting with the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is the first to propose qa networks for reading comprehension @cite @cite @cite , and reading comprehension. starting from squad @cite , there is a large body of work that aims to learn qa functions directly from document documents @cite @cite . recently , the success of deep reading and reading comprehension on sequence reading @cite @cite has resulted in a surge of interest in improving the training and testing performance @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims to propose a introspective learning approach ( rc ) training framework ( cl ) , which can be viewed as an extension of the alternating method proposed in this paper .
- neural network aggregation ( cl ) @cite @cite @cite has been a popular tool for answer matching @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to answer the question of whether the answer is answer to the question is answer , and the answer to answer questions is question answer is question question question answer @cite . in this paper , we propose a introspective learning method for answer reading comprehension ( compare-aggregate ) @cite . we extend the basic cl approach to a more general setting , and extend it to the more general setting. in particular , we adopt a similar approach to @cite , in which @math is the number of candidate answers in the kb .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , which is closest to ours in that of @cite and @cite . however , they do not consider the problem of learning from self-attention. in the context of abstractive reproduction , and do not require access to the source and target tokens , while our work is more general and accepts a sequence of tokens in the form of <unk> ' s work is also related to the work by @cite , who propose an block-based sampling method for reading and writing alignments in the text and reading it in the kb ; however , their method does not require any solver or any solver .
- our work is also related to the field of human-robot interaction ( robotics ) @cite @cite @cite , which has been successfully applied to team control @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has focused on shared control and control over the environment , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , we do not assume that the agent has access to its environment , but instead we are interested in the task of learning shared control , which can be used to find a safe policy that is used to generate a shared policy. in contrast to @cite , our system does not require human demonstrations , and instead relies on human demonstrations .
- our work is also related to recent work on shared control @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use collaborative filtering ( gps ) to estimate the user ' s intention to recover from human demonstrations. however , this method does not scale well due to the large number of sensors used. in contrast , our approach does not require any human intervention , which is not always available in real-world robotic applications , such as autonomous driving or autonomous driving. instead of using imitation learning , we propose a method that uses shared control ( sfm ) for demonstration and demonstration ( demonstration ) .
- our work is also related to imitation learning @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn in a shared environment that can be used in a supervised fashion @cite @cite . in contrast , our algorithm learns to generate actions in a human environment using human demonstrations , while our algorithm is different in that we are interested in imitation learning , which is different from these approaches , and we are not aware of prior work that has focused on imitation learning for imitation learning. we believe that our algorithm can be seen as a generalization of imitation learning ( safety-aware ) @cite , which has shown to be competitive with imitation learning methods @cite @cite .
- the problem of recognizing actor and action goals has been extensively studied in the context of machine learning @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works assume that the goals are known , and do not always correspond to actions that are close to each other @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general and accepts cooperative goals and can be easily extended to slightly broader settings , such as action recognition @cite @cite , repetition @cite , and feeders @cite @cite . our work differs from these approaches in that we do not assume any cooperative environment , and we are interested in recognizing actions and actions that can be generated from cooperative systems .
- distributed connectivity following a special case of connectivity problem in the minimum genus network was studied in @cite @cite @cite . in the context of distributed connectivity 2-edge-connected networks , the minimum spanning forest ( 2-ecss ) problem has been studied @cite @cite . in particular , low-congestion 2-ecss and williamson @cite proved a constant approximation factor of @math . low-congestion 2-ecss , distributed algorithms have also been studied in the literature. we note that there is also a large gap between distributed algorithms and linear-time rounding schemes in the randomized version of 2-ecss , which we use in our randomized rounding algorithm for the fractional @math round complexity .
- distributional representation methods such as distributional approximators ( <unk> ) @cite , have shown to be effective in reinforcement learning ( rl ) @cite @cite @cite . in particular , distributional approximators such as neural networks have been used to model the dynamics of atari games @cite @cite . however , these methods assume that the agent knows its own dynamics , which may not be optimal. in contrast to these methods , we propose a distributional gac algorithm that finds a policy in a principled manner , which can be seen as a generalization of the distributional bellman equation ( see section ) . in addition to using distributional distributional methods , distributional methods have also been used in distributional risk-sensitive machine learning ( see @cite for a review ) .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use factorized policy gradient ( trpo ) to estimate the probability of a probability distribution over all possible actions. in contrast to our work , our method is more general than @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that applies continuous policy gradient methods , which is a special case of continuous policy optimization , where the objective function @math and @math are continuous . in contrast , our agent learns the optimal policy @math for each actor @math and a continuous function @math . in this paper , we propose a continuous critic , which allows us to identify the underlying probability distribution @math .
- an alternative approach to mobile robot exploration is to use an upper bound on the speed of the robot @cite @cite @cite . mobile robots move continuously to a fixed number of robots , and have been used for a variety of tasks , such as mobile robots @cite @cite , mobile vehicles @cite , repetition @cite , and mobile manipulators @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach does not rely on the assumption that agents have access to the map , and instead relies on the use of an asynchronous sensors @cite @cite . in contrast to our approach , our data map data is modeled as a line of work , and we are interested in the problem of reconstructing holes in a graph .
- automatic security recovery of security services has been studied in the context of autonomous iot @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose a resilient strategic recovery framework that exposes the network to the defender ' s security game , and propose an unknown adversary that incorporates the information from the user ' s interference to the users. in @cite , the authors present an unknown connectivity management framework to mitigate the impact of cyber attacks on the network connectivity through attackers. in @cite @cite , authors propose to use a global connectivity control technique to mitigate cyber attacks caused by attacks such as attacks in @cite and @cite .
- in recent years , several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of secure network recovery in iot. for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a factored equilibrium policy representation ( <unk> ) for the purpose of modeling the user-item connectivity dynamics of the network. in @cite , a factored markov decision process ( sos ) is proposed , which combines the advantages of using dynamic thompson sampling @cite , and approximate the detection of the equilibrium policy in @cite . in this paper , we propose a simplified game-theoretic approach based on a simplified representation of the user ' s policy. in @cite the authors present a game-theoretic approach for studying the risks of attacks in iot and iot .
- simon al @cite propose a security index identification framework based on the gestalt principles of the attentive reader @cite @cite @cite , iterative optimization @cite , imitation learning @cite , and cultural constraints @cite , to quantify the effect of decision making @cite @cite . in contrast , our work aims at minimizing the number of players in the internet of iot nodes , which is a key part of our work , aims to quantify how people invest in the security of the agent ' s choices in the environment @cite @cite . simon ' s plays an important role in security and security awareness of security strategies @cite @cite .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a credential detection model based on the assumption that the credential card fails to detect phishing attacks. in contrast , we proposed a model to detect <unk> phishing websites and detect phishing websites based on their findings. we make use of features based on features of the credential and sending them to victims of phishing websites , which are more likely to be detected and filtered by the user. in addition , our model is able to detect malicious websites , and therefore , it is not suitable for detecting phishing websites . therefore , we are not aware of prior work that is most related to ours .
- the layered testing approach to detect phishing websites is based on the concept of phishing pages @cite . it uses the <unk> filters to detect and detect malicious websites in the web , and uses them to find a set of malicious pages that are likely to be similar to the query. in contrast to our approach , we use credential search for malicious websites , which is an open problem in real-world credit testing , and hence can be applied to malicious websites and credentials and credentials , which are used in our experiments. in addition to the low-cost credential training approach , the <unk> approach of @cite relies on adapting features from web pages to web pages .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to detect phishing websites based on hidden markov models ( hmm ) . their approach is similar to ours , but it does not consider the assumption that ac features are used to determine the victims of phishing passwords. the results of their method show that the critical features of ac are significantly more robust than the ones presented in @cite . however , in contrast to our work , we detect phishing attacks and victims away from phishing websites , which are not effective in detecting phishing attacks. in contrast , our model does not require any manual intervention to the use-case .
- for 3d point detection , @cite proposed a method to train a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that can be trained to tir features. they also proposed to use rgb images as a source of supervision for 3d tracking. however , their method requires a large amount of training data for training , which is impractical for real-world applications. in contrast , our method is not applicable to self-driving cars. in addition , our proposed framework is based on a generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite , which has a very large number of training samples available for training deep networks for self-driving cars. our method uses a lidar point cloud to train the adaptation of the synthetic image to the target point of view .
- semantic segmentation of point cloud point clouds is a well known problem in computer vision. it has been shown that the representational power of deep neural networks ( cnns ) can be successfully applied to semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite a cnn was trained for a 3d point cloud using a spherical lidar scanner ( <unk> ) . in @cite , a context signal was used to a 3d range-image approach for semantic segmentation , and in @cite for a 2d image segmentation application. in @cite the authors propose a context range-image approach based on the squeezenet architecture proposed in @cite .
- the recent elasticfusion of @cite is a semi-dense expanding method for the semantic segmentation of a single image using a contracting path. this path is then used for segmentation of the input image , which is then skipped in the input image. in contrast to @cite , our range-image approach can be used for pixel-wise segmentation , and our range-image method is similar to @cite . however , we do not use u-net as a u-net architecture for semantic segmentation and segmentation , but we are not aware of any solver that can be trained end-to-end , and we also use u-net for segmentation , as well .
- deep learning has recently been applied to a variety of machine learning problems , such as image classification @cite @cite , and conditional random fields ( crfs ) @cite . for example , the gps structure @cite @cite has shown to be very powerful. it has been shown that using gps for joint inference @cite @cite can achieve competitive results on a large number of tasks @cite @cite @cite . however , in our work , we are interested in using spns as a supervised learning problem , and we are not aware of any prior work that applies conditional generative models ( dp ) to train spns .
- introvae @cite is a pioneering work on generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite , which has shown impressive results in many computer vision tasks , such as image generation @cite @cite @cite , and shape generation @cite . the key difference between our method and the above methods is that we use the gan as a starting point to learn the clean and clean image that can be used to reconstruct the clean image. in addition to using the vae @cite , we propose to use the vae as an alternative to the variational auto-encoder ( vae ) @cite @cite . in contrast to @cite , the plug and plug in the image and generates images with radically increased magnitudes. in addition , we use a gan to generate images and decode the latent space from the latent space. in contrast , our method can be viewed as a special case of gans , which can be seen as a generalization of forward-backward consistency and posterior sparsity @cite @cite .
- there has been a lot of work on catastrophic forgetting in the last few years @cite @cite @cite . recently , several approaches have been proposed to tackle catastrophic forgetting @cite @cite , including neural-based models slm @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and pathnet @cite . our work is also related to @cite , which uses a pre-trained network to predict the state of the art dialogue state tracking. in contrast , we propose a dialogue state generator that can be generated by a small number of training examples , which can be used to improve tracking performance .
- existing work on mal ' ' ' algorithms can be broadly categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) rule-based approaches @cite @cite @cite and ( 2 ) model-based methods @cite @cite . in the first category of methods , mal ' s approach @cite @cite is based on area theory @cite @cite . in the second category of approaches deep marl , the second group learns from cooperative behavior @cite @cite , and ( 3 ) deep reinforcement learning @cite @cite . in this category we focus on methods that do not consider multi-agent scenarios where agents have access to their own action @cite @cite . in this paper , we introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning agent that aims at getting stuck in local minima in local optima .

- 3d human pose estimation has recently became a hot research topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in recent years , convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved remarkable success in 3d pose estimation @cite @cite . in particular , cnns have achieved state-of-the-art results in object detection @cite @cite and 3d human part segmentation @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical globalnet to regress 3d pose from a single image using a cnn to regress the 3d keypoints. in contrast , our method is based on the globalnet to estimate 3d pose for 3d pose estimation. in this paper , we propose an efficient and efficient approach to 3d pose estimation <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- a number of approaches have been proposed for human pose estimation , such as @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a multi-stage network to learn a human pose prior to the input image , which is then used to predict the pose of the input from the input image. in @cite a knowledge graph prior to pose estimation in the input input image from the output of a cnn is used for pose estimation and pose estimation. in @cite @cite , a knowledge cnn was used for multi-person pose estimation . in @cite the authors train a network to predict pose for each human pose using a single image prior .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a rendezvous strategy based on the impact of the interaction of the robots. they proposed a method for exploration of the environment using drop-out , and @math , where @math and @math are the number of sessions @math , @math , and overlap @math . this method has a similar flavor to the work presented in this paper. in contrast , our method does not rely on the assumption that the interference of the robot is known to be the same as the one used in this work. in contrast to these approaches , our coordination strategy does not require any knowledge of interference , which is a key component in robotics .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a rendezvous strategy based on the assumption that the robot has access to the environment. in this work , the robot is equipped with a team of robots equipped with the robot arm , and its environment. in addition to the interference of obstacles , the search time of the robot plays an important role in coordination between the robots and grasped objects , as well as the interference between the manipulators and the robots are subjected to various transformations , such as interference cancellation ( gps ) . in contrast , we propose a method based on <unk> , which allows robots to communicate directly with the environment .
- recently , deep learning has been successfully applied to 3d point clouds @cite @cite @cite . for example , pointnet @cite is one of the most successful approaches for 3d point recognition , which uses a spatial pyramid pooling ( fractionally ) strided convolution layers to capture global relationship between local and global features. recently pointnet @cite was proposed to learn 3d features for 3d shapes , which is similar to pointnet @cite . in contrast , we propose a deep neural network to learn features directly from 3d features , which are more robust to occlusion variations in illumination variations and scale variations in shape variations .
- multi-view learning has been extensively studied in recent years. for example , gift @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are examples of gift @cite and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite share similar features across different views , and <unk> @cite propose a bilinear pooling layer to obtain mid-level features for view recognition. differently from these works , we propose a global pooling layer that learns global features for each view by jointly optimizing the shape and viewpoint correlation .
- recently , many methods have been proposed for 3d image retrieval , such as @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a graph clique matching ( <unk> ) , which consists of a set of 2d images of @math and @math , where @math is the number of features in @math . in @cite , the spatial cliques of images are divided into part-based models and fed them into a graph to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. however , the above methods do not consider the relationship between features and features , which may not be optimal. to overcome this problem , we propose a novel clique pooling ( <unk> ) which learns features of the features of different views of the same shape .
- the implementation of the fpga ' s recovery problem in fpga is related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the authors propose a multi-gpu implementation that performs the opencl algorithm in fpga by <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our study does not rely on opencl access to parallel access to the program and can only be applied to any of the program ' s code centers and can be used to improve the accuracy of the implementation .
- our work is also related to recent work on neural machine translation ( nmt ) @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that has focused on training language models , such as lm @cite , or single-shot translation @cite . our work differs in that we train a translation system based on the encoder and decoder side encoders , which are more general than our approach , in that it requires access to the final output of a good output and can be used as a good testbed for training a smaller translation. we note that our approach is orthogonal to the work of <unk> , which is a different line of research in the sense that it uses a large amount of training data available on a large number of languages available for training languages .
- our work is also related to recent work on neural machine translation @cite @cite @cite . in this work , we use a pre-trained neural network architecture for machine translation , where the encoder is fine-tuned on imagenet @cite , and fine-tuned on the imagenet classification task @cite . in contrast to @cite , our approach uses a more general architecture that is pre-trained on machine translation and machine translation tasks , enabling us to train a neural translation system based on a large amount of labeled training examples and train a translation system that is trained on a target language , and thus is able to generalize across languages .
- our work is also related to recent work on cross-lingual representation learning @cite @cite @cite . our work differs from these works in two aspects : ( 1 ) we focus on unsupervised representation learning , and ( 2 ) training a translation model that is trained on monolingual data ; ( 3 ) instead of using unlabeled data , we train a translation classifier that classifies trained on unlabelled monolingual data , while ( 4 ) using monolingual data to train a representation that can be transferred to cross-lingual representations @cite @cite .

- gordon and <unk> @cite propose a <unk> logic protocol for <unk> <unk> @cite , which is based on a prototype of <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . this paper is different in that we are interested in a more general proof of gordon and <unk> in contrast , our proof is more principled and easier to implement and more adaptable than a wider range of rules and can be applied to ml applications .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a proof of <unk> ' ' @cite , which is based on <unk> ' s @cite and <unk> ' s proof library @cite . the main difference between our work and ours is that we do not rely on <unk> , but instead , we are interested in checking how tactics are used in order to find bugs that are indicative of how close it is <unk> in contrast , our proof system is more general and applicable than @cite @cite , but it also does not support soundness , but also allows us to use <unk> to <unk> and <unk> in contrast to @cite @cite @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which describes a methodology for representing proof spaces in hol framework. the work of <unk> @cite is similar to ours , but we do not provide a formal definition of proof semantics , but instead we are interested in proof spaces that are characterized in terms of verification quality , as well as in the context of proof theory @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our proof system does not require specification of proof spaces , which can be used in conjunction with other theory tools such as <unk> @cite , or <unk> @cite .
- there has been a large body of work on checking proof assistants for checking proof systems. for example , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite conservatively contribute to the centre of the proof of correctness of proof checking. however , these approaches do not support the construction of proof assistants , or are <unk> to the best of our knowledge , we are not aware of any work that applies hybrid proof techniques to distinctively inductive proofs .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a proof of <unk> ' ' that is based on <unk> ' s proof of <unk> ' s thesis @cite . <unk> ' s work is closest to ours , but it is different from ours in that we do not require any specification of the solver , but instead we are interested in checking non-determinism , as we do. <unk> and <unk> @cite also present a method called <unk> , which is similar to <unk> ' ' ' . however , we are not aware of work that is most closely related to ours in the sense that it is more <unk> than <unk> .

- fully convolutional networks ( fcn ) @cite @cite @cite have shown remarkable success in semantic segmentation @cite @cite . for example , deeplabv3+ @cite uses a pyramid of spatial pyramid pooling ( aspp ) to improve the resolution of the feature map. pspnet @cite uses upsampled spatial pyramids to facilitate semantic segmentation , which is similar to pspnet @cite . pspnet @cite designs a pyramid pooling module to reduce resolution of receptive fields of <unk> and <unk> @cite designs deep networks for semantic segmentation and segmentation , but this method does not scale well for systems with heavy computation cost. pspnet @cite is a pyramid pyramid of 32 @math 32 @math filters , where @math and @math are the downsampled version of the input and @math respectively .
- batch normalization ( densenet ) @cite @cite @cite is one of the most successful approaches to deep neural networks for semantic segmentation @cite @cite . densenet @cite is the first layer of deep networks , which is based on <unk> @cite . it is also known that cnns can be applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , semantic segmentation , image segmentation @cite , and semantic modelling @cite @cite . densenet @cite uses cnns to extract features from a single feature map , and then uses them to warp the input feature maps to the output of the networks to the rest of the feature maps .
- an alternative approach to producing feedforward nets is to use feedforward neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , an online clustering algorithm is proposed in @cite , where the goal is to minimize the likelihood of each panel in a single panel , in @cite . in @cite the authors propose a hybrid actor-critic solver based on the idea that the areas of the problem can be played by a linear traveling salesman problem ( ilp ) . in @cite @cite , the authors use fast gradient descent ( sgd ) to find contigs , while in @cite a similar technique is used to solve the problem of reconstructing contigs features .

- feedforward neural networks have also been used for solving combinatorial problems @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) that maintains a sequence of options ( a tree ) over a set of options , and in @cite for a knapsack problem , where each node maintains its own weight , which is then sent to a tree to a node with the rest of the message. in this paper , we use an ordinary reinforce algorithm to find the optimal value of a node that has already been visited by the user. in contrast to @cite , we do not assume that the policy is known .
- deep reinforcement learning ( rl ) has also been applied to combinatorial problems @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to learn combinatorial problems in which the optimal policy is approximated by solving an optimization problem that maximizes the expected value of the current policy. in @cite the authors present a method to learn a policy that optimizes the maximum adjustment problem over a set of options , and show that it is possible to use a greedy heuristic. in contrast , our method does not require any solver , which is more scalable to large graphs .

- 3d point clouds have been widely used in computer vision , such as object recognition @cite @cite , object detection @cite , or segmentation @cite @cite . in particular , 3d point cloud data is used to extract the representation of the point cloud @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to learn a sparse representation of a 2d input point cloud using 3d convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . in contrast to these methods , we use 3d convolutions to learn the feature representation , which is a key component of our method , and thus can be applied to many applications .
- pointnet @cite is a neural network based network architecture that respects the spatial correlations between points in the feature space , and uses a prior to aggregate the features of the point cloud to generate local features for the 3d point cloud , which can also be used for the spatial arrangement of point clouds. however , in practice , pointnet does not consider the entire point cloud as a whole , which limits its application to real-world applications , such as autonomous vehicles @cite @cite , or irregular objects @cite . in contrast to the above methods that are designed for the purpose of aggregating local features in the 3d data layer , our network layer is fully connected .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use neural networks to predict the interpretability of an ai engineer and evaluate their chances of going to be. in contrast to our work , our work is also related to the work of @cite , which is closest to ours , but differs from @cite in that our model is more general than theirs in two aspects. first , we generate explanations for the model , which are then used as features for the classification of the program and the model is trained for the task of classifying examples belonging to the kb .
- there is a large body of work on interpretability of ai systems for machine learning @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on reviewing the literature related to the field of research that is related to our work , as well as related work on composition of programs that are more relevant to the task of composition and analysis of programs . in contrast , our work is primarily concerned with interpreting and explaining rules of programs and models , rather than basing inference on outcomes on the outcomes of programs or models trained on the taxonomic syntax of programs ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) .
- there has been a large body of work on interpretable machine learning models @cite @cite @cite . for example , lime @cite and lime @cite are examples of interpretable models , eg. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . our work differs in that we focus on generating hypothetical explanations for the model and use them for generating explanations .
- in the case of @math , @math is the @math th entry of @math and @math , and @math is a sequence of symbols in @math , where @math are the number of categories in @math . for @math , for @math categories , @math , the number @math is fixed and @math for @math . for a given @math , we are interested in an interval @math that contains @math categories of @math . for simplicity , we refer the reader to the recent survey by <unk> and <unk> @cite for a more extensive review on the topic of @math . the reader is referred to the monograph by .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite present a @math -valued model that recovers @math from @math and @math . the @math th column of a ring is denoted by @math . in contrast to the @math -edge connected graph ( <unk> ) @cite , we provide an alternative tool for recovering @math and a qr decomposition using a tessellation of @math ( see also @cite ) . in this paper , we use a <unk> tool that is based on the motivic goerss-hopkins version of the em version ( <unk> ) tool @cite . in this case , @math is the number of atoms associated with @math .
- there has been a lot of work on sif in the context of double models , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that , for example , in @cite , it was shown that for @math and @math , @math , with @math , the analogue of the @math of @math , is equivalent to @math , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . in this paper , we prove that @math is a universal functor being equivalent to an that we can use in @math . in contrast to the @math <unk> @math <unk> @math , we say that @math . in this case , the @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math is not equivalent to a @math <unk> @math , which has a restriction on @math , but not @math .
- in the context of universal models , <unk> and <unk> @cite proved that for mixtures of @math , there exists a @math -valued environment version of the substitution law version of a routinely identified in the construction of a kleisli instance in @math . <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that turi. variants of logic models , such as binders , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> , and <unk> , in the reversible formulation of the underlying algebra version of logic programs .
- there is a long line of work on sif in a general setting @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that , for example , in @math , @math , the @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math , and @math <unk> @math , with @math <unk> , @math . for @math , it is shown that @math is a non-symmetric , @math stating that @math and @math is weakly dominated by a monads. <unk> ' ' ' <unk> ' <unk> ' a proof of theorem is given in the proof of lemma <unk> ' s theorem is similar in spirit to the results in @cite .
- our work is also related to recent work on story alignment and parsing @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on aspects of document captioning , and we are not aware of any prior work that is related to ours , e.g. , @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , our work differs in that it focuses on question answering ( story-like ) , which is different from ours , in that we predict the relation between sentences and actions in a kb using the same language as us. in contrast to @cite , we predict sentences from sentences in natural language clips , while our work focuses on reasoning about sentences from question-answering , in which actions are inferred from video content .
- recently , face detection has been dominated by object detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , resnext @cite is the first layer that transforms the input image into a deep residual network ( resnet ) @cite , which transforms a deep convolutional layer into a binary classification network ( <unk> ) , is the cardinality estimation of the input ( <unk> ) , which is the key building block in resnet @cite and its variants @cite @cite , have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite and semantic segmentation @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel layer quantization layer for sign estimation .
- the idea of using residual support vector machines ( <unk> ) @cite is similar to resnet in that it uses residual connections to find a skip connection between the input layer and the output. however , it is not clear how to binarize all weights , which is not necessary for binarization ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our method is more general than that of @cite @cite , where the weights are updated at the beginning of the quantization step , and thus can be accelerated by general-purpose residual networks. moreover , our approach is different from @cite , in that we propose a factorized residual network ( <unk> ) , while we binarize the weights in the original feature space .
- recently , convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved remarkable success in image binarization @cite @cite @cite . for example , hourglass @cite and <unk> @cite propose hourglass networks , which first regress keypoints ' ' ' from the input image , and then generate part proposals by minimizing the discrepancy between the input and the output of the network , which is similar to the binary parts of the input image. in this way , anchors are gradually selected from the training set , which are sampled from the testing set to obtain the final output of a binary classification model. in contrast , anchors can be regarded as a max-margin structured max-margin based filter @cite @cite , which has shown remarkable performance in pose estimation @cite @cite .

- semantic metric learning ( pointnet ) @cite is a pioneering work to learn geometric transformations of point clouds. pointnet @cite uses a voxel grid to compute the difference between neighboring points in the feature space. it uses the <unk> to find geometric transformations that are invariant to transformations that can be shared across different feature spaces , but it does not scale well to large clouds and can also be used for semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . pointnet++ @cite uses the same architecture as pointnet @cite , which uses a different network architecture , but uses the <unk> at the cost of slightly improving the segmentation accuracy .
- semantic irregularity segmentation ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular tool for geometric segmentation and geometric segmentation , which is based on points partitioning @cite @cite , so-net @cite , and so-net @cite . these methods are based on convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) , which are able to capture the semantic structure of point clouds. however , these methods require large amount of labeled training data , which limits the generalization ability of convolutional networks ( convnets ) . in contrast to these methods , our proposed neural network-based neural network-based architecture is more scalable than the original one proposed in this paper .
- semantic semantic irregularity classification ( <unk> ) @cite is the most popular approach for semantic segmentation , which is based on the vgg-16 network @cite and vgg @cite . pointnet @cite is one of the most successful approaches for semantic semantic segmentation and segmentation , and has shown impressive results in challenging computer vision applications such as semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how geometric features learned from the 3d cnn are learned by the networks , and thus cannot be learned directly from the original input data. in contrast , the proposed dilated convolutional networks ( <unk> ) @cite are able to capture long-range dependencies among the points in the 3d space .
- geometric features such as sift @cite , geodesic distance @cite , edge orientation @cite , and its variants @cite @cite have been successfully applied to the task of shape segmentation @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider 3d geometry , which is a key component of our geometric segmentation method , as we will show in section . this is due to the large receptive field size of the image , which may be too large to be applied to large-scale 3d point clouds , as demonstrated in the introduction of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite . in contrast to @cite @cite , we use the deep convolutional networks ( cnns ) for 3d point cloud segmentation .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image deblurring @cite , face deblurring @cite @cite , deblurring @cite and deblurring @cite . however , these methods require paired data for training and testing , which limits the application of deep learning to blind image recognition. in contrast , our method learns to measure the similarity between images and text priors by minimizing the discrepancy between the distributions of visual and visual features. our method is also inspired by recent work on blind image deblurring in image deblurring , where the goal is to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy ( mmd ) between the fact that images can be used to train a generative adversarial network ( gan ) .
- recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , image deblurring @cite , and blind enhancement @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider the general gopro datasets , which are different from the knowledge-driven methods @cite . however , in practice , it is difficult to apply to blind image restoration problems such as blind image recognition. recently , deep learning has shown its superior performance in blind image deblurring , thanks to the development of deep neural networks @cite . in this paper , we propose a corrector method based on residual learning. in addition , we empirically demonstrate that it recurrently update the blur estimates of the blur in the blur kernel estimates .
- identity-related features have also been used for category-specific facial expression recognition @cite @cite @cite , image recognition @cite , and shoulder detection @cite @cite . however , these methods are limited to recognizing facial appearance variations , and are not robust to occlusion variations in illumination variations @cite @cite . our work differs from these methods in two ways : ( 1 ) we use 3d sequences ( 2 ) sequences of noisy facial pixels ( 3 ) sequences and ( 4 ) we are interested in recognizing facial expression variations with the presence of subtle changes in the appearance and appearance of the motion and appearance variations in the spatio-temporal domain .
- facial pain recognition ( lbp-top ) @cite is a popular method for facial expression recognition @cite @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to recognizing facial expressions in videos @cite @cite . recently , there has been a lot of work on recognizing facial pain @cite @cite , facial expression @cite , and shoulder @cite @cite . recently , latent variable models have been used to represent facial expressions @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on hand-crafted features , which are not robust to occlusion variations , illumination , expression , occlusion , or texture changes , which is the focus of this paper .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image captioning @cite , action recognition @cite , facial expression recognition @cite @cite , and facial landmark detection @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a 3d cnn for recognizing facial expression variations in the physical environment using 3d cnn features , which are able to capture the temporal dynamics of the physical world. the work in @cite proposed an effective way to extract landmark-based landmark-based features from two video frames. in contrast to these works , we proposed 3d cnn models to extract facial features directly from the raw image itself .
- recently , temporal action detection has became increasingly popular in action detection @cite @cite @cite . gkioxari al @cite propose to use selective search @cite to localize the temporal regions of the video. <unk> al @cite adopt structured regression to predict the temporal boundaries of the action boundaries , and predict the position of the center of the next action region. li al @cite use structured random forest ( ssn ) to model the temporal context of action proposals , which is similar to our one-stage action detection method @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we propose a novel classification branch based method for action detection .
- there has been a lot of work on synthesising 3d data from in-the-wild speech @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on the realism of a 3d scanner ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in contrast , our work focuses on 3d speech , which is more general and more general than the manifesting dataset ( see , e.g. @cite ) . we are not aware of prior work on 3d facial reading , but we are primarily interested in synthesising sequences of continuous-valued speech , rather than directly estimating the mouth movement of a path from the head , and to the best of our knowledge .
- the price of anarchy ( poa ) was first introduced by frieze and grimmett @cite @cite @cite . it was shown that the number of nodes @math grows linearly with @math @cite @cite . later on , <unk> and sudan @cite proved that for @math , there exists an upper bound of @math for @math @cite , which holds for all @math @cite . in particular , it is known that if @math is bounded by @math , then @math is the maximum degree of anarchy @cite @cite . recently , the notion of price ' ' @cite @cite , where @math and @math are the maximum number of vertices in the graph @cite @cite .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who study the price of anarchy in the context of the design of the price network , showing that it is possible to approximate the edge dynamics of the network network and the optimum of the edge weights of the network. in particular , they show that the existence of an upper bound of @math for the edge network dynamics is @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the network , @math , and @math for all @math . in this paper , we extend the results of @cite to the case of @math and @math .
- recently , word embeddings have been applied to the task of learning word embeddings for text classification @cite @cite @cite . the skip-gram model @cite is the most popular approach to learn a word embedding for words in a text corpus , where the embeddings are learned from the word embeddings. a large corpus of words in the corpus is labeled with a large training corpus of word2vec embeddings @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any training data to be available for training , and thus can be applied to apps for apps with large unlabeled data. we note that a large number of systems have been proposed in the literature for learning word representations .
- there has been a large body of work on user neighbor classification for notifications @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on specific types of data , such as freebase @cite @cite or lingpipe http : <unk> @cite @cite . our work differs from these approaches in that we aim to find new features for fine-grained retrieval and retrieval. while we are interested in extracting new features from apps , we are not aware of any work that is most related to the work that has focused on excluding apps that are most relevant for our task. we also use a similar approach for extracting user experience in mobile apps .

- action recognition in still images is a challenging task due to the lack of sufficient training data for action recognition. in @cite , the authors propose a 3d optical flow descriptor to estimate depth from rgb images using rgb images and optical flow respectively. in @cite the authors use a 3d histogram of oriented gradients ( klt ) @cite , which is based on handcrafted features , which are then fed into a video classification pipeline based on a 3d cnn to predict depth and motion of actions subjected to occlusion deformations , such as histograms of oriented 4d normals ( <unk> ) @cite . however , these methods are not robust to occlusions and are not applicable to human bodies .
- human activity recognition has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite use histograms of oriented gradients ( hog ) features ( hoof ) to recognize human actions in videos , while <unk> al @cite combine rgb and optical flow features for recognition and recognition of human action recognition. however , these methods are not robust to occlusion due to the lack of large number of modalities ( e.g. head pose , arm head pose and arm pose ) . in contrast , our feature representation is based on histograms of human motion and is more robust to human motion .
- sports action recognition in videos has been a hot research topic in computer vision , with a comprehensive review see @cite . here , we briefly review related work related to action recognition. in this section , we present a brief review and review related representation and representation learning. please refer to @cite for an excellent review on sports analytics and refer to the review authored by @cite . in this paper , we propose a discriminative method based on local representation of actions , which is based on the histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) . in contrast , our method does not rely on local features , which are more robust to occlusion and can be easily extended .
- to solve the action recognition problem , several methods have been proposed for action recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a fisher vector ( <unk> ) for estimating human pose from rgb-d videos , and achieved state-of-the-art results on action recognition benchmarks. in @cite , <unk> al proposed a <unk> framework for estimating hand pose and pose of human actions using deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite . in contrast to these methods , our method is based on <unk> and <unk> in the first step , we propose a discriminative regularization method based on local features , which can handle occlusion and occlusions .
- features have been widely used in action recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , hog3d @cite uses histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite , eigenjoints @cite , surface interest point ( <unk> ) @cite and eigenjoints @cite @cite . the biggest drawback of these methods is that they are based on hand-crafted features , such as hog , hof and mbh features , which are not robust to occlusion variations in illumination variations , illumination , and occlusions , due to the lack of sufficient training data for action recognition. skeleton-based action recognition ( <unk> ) @cite is a detection-based method for action recognition in videos , which is based on principal component analysis ( pca ) @cite @cite .
- recently , conditional random fields ( crfs ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , template matching @cite , and image segmentation @cite . however , it is not clear how to increase the computation speed of the convolution. our work differs in two ways. first , the first learns a conditional random field for the inference task , and then the inference is learned by minimizing the @math -norm of the loss function , which is a linear combination of @math and @math , where @math is the number of instances in the training set , @math is a hyperparameter .

- in @cite , the authors propose a merkle trees ( <unk> ) for optimizing the tree nodes in order to minimize the number of nodes in the network. in @cite the authors present an algorithm for optimizing node links in the tree low-power networks , and show that the proposed sinkhole sinkhole sinkhole can be accelerated by using the wormhole operation on the destination. in @cite a similar approach to ours is presented in @cite . in this paper , we propose a <unk> sinkhole sinkhole based algorithm for jamming and reliable data from blackhole data , which is more scalable than that of the rpl routing protocol .
- in @cite , the authors propose a two-step approach for low packet mobility detection ( pdr ) , which is based on the assumption that nodes freeze the back-off parent node , and show that low packet delay latency can be achieved. however , this method does not consider multiple communication scenarios , which may lead to very low communication overload @cite . moreover , in @cite the authors present an implementation of rpl over 100 nodes of the same parent network , which makes rpl more robust to communication attacks than rpl in @cite . in this paper , we propose a routing scheme based on recoup , which uses the same technique as <unk> .

- the work most closely related to ours is fasttext @cite ( <unk> ) @cite which learns word embeddings for each word in a sentence by embedding vectors into a vocabulary , and fasttext @cite is the most commonly used model for the task of information retrieval ( bert ) . it is trained on a large corpus of news articles , with a large number of labeled training examples for the training data , such as chinese. however , this is due to the large amount of training data available for training deep neural networks , which is a large gap between the training and test datasets. in this paper , we demonstrate that these models are significantly more effective than supervised learning .
- the work most closely related to ours is bert @cite , which is the first biobert @cite , consists of attaching a pre-trained word embeddings for each word in the text corpus , and then applies it to the context of question answering ( vqa ) . it is worth pointing out that bert does not have a one-to-one mapping between phrases and phrases in the phrases , but also has a one-to-one alignment between the phrases in text and the corresponding words. however , this method does not scale well for texts with only a small set of keywords. in contrast , our method is based on word embeddings , which are trained for a large collection of texts .

- the proof of injectivity theorem is based on the idea of <unk> @cite , which is similar to our approach , but we do not require any solver to be run in an efficient manner , unless the solver is replaced by an external memory , or the rest of the system is run in memory ( see section ) , and we present an approach for specifying loop invariants for the loop closure problem ( see figure ( b ) ) . we note that in contrast , we are not aware of any solver that can be used for efficient search and efficient search of an arbitrary length sequence .

- tcp @cite is a popular method to accelerate model model training by reducing the number of filters in the feature space. it has been shown that resnet-50 @cite achieves state-of-the-art performance on imagenet classification benchmarks @cite @cite @cite . however , it is hard to scale to large training data because of the large number of pruned channels , the original features can be accelerated by @math by @math . thus filter pruning can be applied to negative pruning @cite @cite and taylor expansion @cite . in contrast , we propose to use transferable filters to mitigate model flops. in contrast to the negative pruning methods @cite @cite , our method is based on the recurrent neural network ( rnn ) .
- tcp ip @cite is a popular approach for reducing the number of weights in the channel by reducing the higher flops. the crossover rate ( <unk> ) is the most effective way to reduce the feature size in the feature space , which is the key factor for the transfer learning in the cross-domain transfer setting. the main drawback of this method is that it requires large amount of training data to train. moreover , it is difficult to scale to large datasets. moreover , in practice , it has been shown that transferable filters with smaller kernel sizes ( @math @math @math ) can be used for taylor approximation @cite .

- rule-based games are a prominent type of rule-based games @cite @cite @cite . the key idea is to find the optimal policy gradient ( l-bfgs ) @cite , which is based on gradient descent ( sgd ) @cite . the gradient of the gradients in the gradient descent direction is to minimize the gradient w.r.t. the objective function. this method can be seen as an alternative method that uses gradient descent on the gradients computed by gradient descent , where gradients are computed using gradient descent. this method has been shown to be effective in defending against adversarial attacks in atari 2600 environments @cite . however , it is not clear how such methods can scale to large environments .
- in @cite , the authors propose a rule-based critic for a starcraft micromanagement task , using a single critic to choose between the counterfactual and credit assignment. in contrast to our work , we do not consider scenarios where agents have access to the environment , but instead of a single agent , agents are able to learn a reward function that can be used with a reward function. however , this approach does not consider the problem of multi-agent credit assignment problems , which is different from ours in that it does not require a sufficient amount of agent intervention , which makes use of private information .

- our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose a testing tool for generating test cases in which the dnn is trained in an end-to-end fashion , which is used to detecting behaviors in autonomous driving environments. however , this method does not scale well to large numbers of robots. moreover , we use the <unk> method , but we are not aware of the <unk> method , which does not rely on the use of private information , but instead relies on the <unk> approach , which relies heavily on the <unk> method , in contrast , ford , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- the problem of learning consistent embeddings has been studied in the context of online learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an online algorithm for predicting the label of a given set. in @cite the authors present a notion of optimal bounds for the label prediction problem , where the goal is to predict the labels of the given set. the authors in @cite propose a weighted embedding algorithm based on the @math -edge connected graph ( <unk> ) , which has been shown to be polynomial in the number of graphs @cite @cite . in @cite @cite , it is shown that for graphs with bounded cut , the problem is solvable in @math time @cite .
- the problem of graph embedding has been extensively studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a transductive least squares least squares ( <unk> ) algorithm to estimate the marginal likelihood of data points in the graph. in @cite the authors present a method for fitting dynamic graphs to dynamic graphs , where data points are assumed to lie in a low-dimensional manifold , and the goal is to find the optimal solution for dynamic graphs in which the data points lie close to each other are close to the original graph. in the same vein , the method in @cite is based on the theory of @cite , where the adjacency matrix is assumed to be sparse , and hence it is assumed that the data change in a graph is known .
- learning of network embeddings has been studied extensively in the context of learning combinatorial problems @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an efficient algorithm for computing the likelihood of locally connected vectors of nodes in the graph. in @cite the authors present a flexible solution for learning node embeddings for graphs of graphs , where nodes correspond to vertices of the input graphs and edges of the graph correspond to the edges. in @cite @cite , nodes in graphs are assumed to be connected to vertices in a random walk graph , which is shown to be a generalization of network families .
- product hashing ( srp ) @cite is a general framework for solving asymmetric vector quantization problems , which can be formulated as a semi-definite programming problem , where @math is the number of nonzero elements in @math and @math are the size of @math . this method can be seen as a special case of product hashing , where product @math is a number of columns and columns of @math and as a function of @math . srp is a quantization method which is based on the @math <unk> hashing algorithm @cite . this method does not require any extra information about the underlying search space. therefore , it is not clear how to perform ivfadc hashing .
- product decomposition ( product decomposition ) @cite @cite is a popular approach to exploit the multiscale structure of product structures. product descriptors ( <unk> ) @cite and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite are examples of <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , which are the first to propose a quantization method for product search. however , these methods are not suitable for large scale datasets , and are not practical for large-scale datasets , especially for simd applications ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) , which is the focus of our work , is on product quantization and quantization , as well as a number of quantization steps .
- locally orthogonal vector quantization ( sr ) @cite is a popular method to exploit the multiscale residual information in the time domain , which can be used to reduce the quantization errors in the feature space. however , this method is not applicable to large datasets with large scale inverted index quantization , which is a very different problem than that of quantizing the feature dimension to @math . in this paper , we propose a fast and efficient algorithm for quantizing the inner product to @math and @math . in addition , we use residual filtering ( <unk> ) to perform local search in asymmetric settings .
- red-black structures , such as norec @cite , have shown to be a powerful tool for software compilation @cite @cite @cite . herlihy and wing @cite propose to use lock-free compilation to reduce memory contention on the memory footprint of the adjacency matrix by using the <unk> method @cite . it is also known that global norec can be used by herlihy @cite and <unk> @cite . it is shown that updates to free memory updates in the adjacency map , such that the adjacency updates to the original data , and thus updates to global ones. in contrast to these algorithms , our algorithm does not need to store data in our list .
- our work is also related to recent work on data generation @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on the adjacency matrix , which is not the focus of this paper. instead , we are interested in strategies based on the idea that operations can be used to reduce the amount of memory required for the map of the sequence of tokens in order to reduce memory usage. we believe our work confirms the importance of sequence operations based on lock-free step. we believe that this is a key step towards improving the speedup of adjacency matrix based on intel xeon anniversary and <unk> , and demonstrate the superiority of using a technique in performance analysis @cite .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . their work is closest to ours , but we do not focus on data lists , which is the focus of this paper. the key difference is that adjacency matrix is a fragment of the adjacency matrix , which can be used in our work , is similar in spirit to mdlist and <unk> , but our work differs from @cite in that we use graph traversal to find map vertices to a sequence of tokens , while in our case , we are interested in the list of nodes in the map .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the authors propose rebalancing of a sequence of mutations in a dictionary , structural , and position of nodes in a graph. in contrast , we focus on finding binary blocks that are known to be ordered by the position of all nodes in the dictionary , while in our case , data lists are stored in a graph , and stored in memory , respectively. in contrast to @cite @cite , these algorithms do not require rebalancing node in a sequence , which is ordered by node degree @math . in contrast rebalancing node knows all nodes that fall in one partition. hence , these methods are not applicable to our setting .
- our work is also related to data adjacency lists @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on data linkage , which is the focus of this paper , on the theoretical analysis of data adjacency matrices. in contrast , we present an approach based on boosting strategies @cite @cite . in contrast to these approaches , we do not require rebalancing of a data structure , which can be viewed as a special case of data linkage ( e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .

- fisheye video alignment has been a hot topic in computer graphics @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose an hfr system based on projective geometry mosaicing @cite , which compensates the robot in the calibration of the scenes. recently , <unk> al @cite use a dynamic camera model to localize the driving objects in the wild , which is based on visual blending and live camera @cite . in contrast to these works , we propose a global user alignment with a visual camera , which can be used to estimate the robot ghosting effects. in addition to using a single image alignment technique , our method is able to mitigate the calibration errors caused by noticeable artifacts .
- an alternative approach for fisheye video stitching is to precompute roadmaps or corridors and feedback @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are limited to moving objects in the environment , which is impractical for real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles , cars , cars and pedestrians , and <unk> in contrast , our fisheye video alignment telepresence system is based on fisheye video processing. however , we do not require any segmentation of the environment in the form of fisheye video cutting vehicles , and we are not aware of any work that has been proposed previously. in this paper , we propose a spatial camera alignment with a seam environment .
- attributes have been used for data matching @cite @cite @cite . for example , magellan and <unk> @cite use deep neural networks ( cnns ) to learn representations of entities in a graph , where each entity is associated with a new entity , and the goal is to find a set of entities that are most similar to the original entity and attributes. however , this approach does not scale well to large graphs. in contrast to our work , our work is different in that we use a classification-based perceptron instead of a single entity , which is more expressive than dtw since it is not scalable to large datasets. moreover , our method is more suitable for graph matching .
- rdf2vec @cite is the first approach to ontology matching for dbpedia graphs. it relies on the assumption that the graph is known to be a centered subgraph of the graph , which is known as the graph matching problem , is equivalent to finding a subgraph that assigns to vertices to edges. the problem of instance matching is also np-complete for man ' s graph , but the problem is quite different from ours in that we do not require any edge matching , but instead we are interested in finding a graph matching matrix that is produced by the graph entity graph , and we are not aware of any work on ontology matching .

- yolo @cite , scnn @cite , and yolov3 @cite @cite @cite use the same backbone as the backbone for object classification , but it is not clear how the network can perform well on a small amount of training data for a large amount of data for training , and in practice , it is hard to scale to large networks with large amounts of data and memory footprint of the proposed algorithm in this paper. yolo @cite also achieves a remarkable improvement in accuracy and accuracy of scnn accelerator models in terms of speed and accuracy loss. however , it requires a relatively large number of channels. in this paper , we propose a compression method in which the network is trained in an end-to-end fashion .

- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of downward path planning. for example , @cite proposed a method called <unk> ( <unk> ) that uses a propositional logic representation of the environment in order to minimize the progression of the environment. levine and koltun @cite proposed an approach called <unk> ( <unk> ) , where the goal is to minimize a cost function in the space of the victim and the victim ' s surface. the deferred ff ( <unk> ) algorithm @cite divides the search space into a set of points in the environment , and then generates the model by using a ga .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose the use of a network to infer the victim ' s path in the target network , and then evaluate it on a directed graph in a greedy fashion. however , this approach does not scale well to large networks with large number of honeypots , which is the focus of our paper . in contrast to our work , we focus on the attacker ' s implementation of a general-purpose network in the presence of them , and thus can be used for the purpose of finding the optimal path for a given network .
- forgetting @cite is a popular method for relation extraction @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that catastrophic relations can be used in a variety of extraction tasks , such as classification @cite @cite , catastrophic forgetting @cite , and forgetting @cite . the key difference between our work and these works is that we are interested in alignment between tasks. in contrast , our model is based on the observation that relations between relations between tasks. we use the same idea as the embedding in @cite and @cite . in addition to the forgetting problem , we propose a model that learns relations in a knowledge graph .

- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the last few years. for example , cache-conscious trees have been used for question answering @cite @cite @cite and entailment @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a query-aware strategy that allows us to use inter-relationships between context questions and context tokens in a knowledge graph ( match-lstm @cite and coattention @cite ) to start and end up to end up , while in our work we propose to use a bidirectional <unk> attention model for inter-relationships between tokens in the question and context , in contrast to @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not rely on inter-relationships between the question embedding .
- in @cite , the authors propose defensive distillation ( <unk> ) , which is based on defensive distillation ' ' ' to suggest that adversarial examples can be used to improve robustness of deep neural networks @cite . in this paper , we focus on the use of a pre-trained adversarial network to defend against the attacks described in this paper. in contrast to @cite , our work is different from @cite , in that it is used to create a manipulated version of deep networks in order to prevent overfitting in the training data , while in our case the <unk> proposition <unk> the <unk> is used in this work .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use wordnet as a source of supervision for the task of babelnet , which is similar to ours in terms of the quality of the translated text. the wordnet tagging task was also used by @cite to identify the senses of parallel corpora using wordnet dictionaries. the authors also use wordnet to identify parallel corpora of wordnets , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . the main difference between our approach and these previous work lies in the selection of the senses and senses .
- there has been a lot of work on supervised translation for all-words prediction @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite trained english wordnets ( <unk> ) to classify the lack of annotated training wordnets ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) , using a set of corpora annotated for evaluating the quality of wordnets ( <unk> ) . @cite used <unk> ( <unk> ) to evaluate the translation quality of parallel corpora for all-words disambiguation .
- the idea of using a parallel array of automata to transport the dynamics of the emergency transportation system was first proposed in @cite . in @cite , a parallel implementation of fpga simulation was proposed , which demonstrated promising results for the task of software engineering in @cite . in @cite the authors proposed a flow collection of automata , which can be used for the construction of sequences of a parallel computing collection of code in tandem with a fluid mechanics model , which was shown to be beneficial for visuomotor evacuation planning in @cite . however , in our work , we focus on the property of emergency planning in emergency scenarios .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a survey of the effectiveness of the tunnels in the passengers breaking down to the passengers of the passengers , which is then used to find the optimal route for the passengers that are likely to be detected by the passengers or fitness function. however , they did not consider the effect of emergency information on passengers , such as passengers or subtitles , or subtitles or passages , which are not considered in this paper. in contrast , in our work , we propose a <unk> property , which relaxes the repetition of emergency evacuation calculations , to estimate emergency evacuation errors .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to count 5 million evacuation models ( dvr ) for evacuation problems ( <unk> ) . however , their approach is based on the observation that the dynamics of the emergency behavior of the cellular environment is not captured. in contrast , our method is more general , since it is not scalable to large scale scenarios , as we do in this paper , we propose a new method for evacuation behavior recognition. in addition , we use the <unk> model , in order to generate a large number of valid exits , as well as the size of the environment .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to route the count of the light automaton located in the environment. in this method , the dynamics of the dynamics are modeled as a sum of evacuation characteristics , which can be expressed as a linear combination of log-likelihoods of individual automata , as well as the number of neurons in the environment , which may be too large to be eliminated due to the lack of an efficient implementation of evacuation system ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we extend the work of @cite , in which we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art of ham ' s method .
- in the last few years , several methods have been proposed for dense crowd counting @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors proposed stacked optical flow ( <unk> ) , which consists of two convolutional layers : density estimation ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . in @cite , density map ( <unk> ) is used to predict bounding boxes for bounding box estimation. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose the use of the <unk> ( <unk> ) method of <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite , which is a special case of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . the main difference between our work and the present paper is that we do not consider the exact case of <unk> ( <unk> ) , which has a different flavor of totally different flavor to the work of <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast , the work in @cite is based on the fact that <unk> ( <unk> ) is conceived to achieve a deadlock with a <unk> ( <unk> ) .

- the problem of 3d imaging has been extensively studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a modified version of the inverse scattering network ( <unk> ) , which converges to an estimate of the refractive index and the <unk> scattering condition. the authors in @cite propose an approach for 3d imaging with non-saturated nodes. in @cite the authors present an approach that compensates for the discrepancy between the frequency and the frequency of the scattering process. in @cite @cite , a modified cg algorithm is presented , where the <unk> converges to the optimal solution of the forward gradient descent algorithm ( <unk> ) .
- our work is also related to the differential privacy algorithm @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to find a class of queries that can be used to answer the question of whether the data structure is axis-aligned or <unk> the goal of this paper is to minimize the number of queries in a domain of differential privacy , which has recently received much attention in the community of computer scientists and practitioners nowadays. for example , the interval @math is used to find the answer @math of a given domain @math . in contrast , we assume that the net answer @math has the same class of differential private queries , and thus we can ask for more succinct queries .

- recently , attention-based encoder-decoder models have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as speech recognition @cite , machine translation @cite @cite , and language modeling @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed to learn a phrase-based neural machine translation ( nmt ) model by minimizing the restricted boltzmann machine ( rbm ) @cite , which has shown to be effective at reducing the number of training samples needed to train a neural network to predict the next sentence. however , these models are not applicable to nmt since the decoder is trained to control the target vocabulary and not for the target domain .
- recently , neural machine translation models have been successfully applied to machine translation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to predict the translation of the source words in a source language in a target language using a bag-of-words model. in this work , we propose to use a neural network architecture for reducing the number of words in an embedding space. in addition to using a neural architecture , we use a one-hot vector representation for the translation between the source language and target words in the target language , and use a simple linear combination of inflectional patterns in word tokens. in contrast to these approaches , our method does not require any preprocessing of the words and phrases .
- multi-head attention is also related to multi-head attention in machine translation @cite @cite @cite . recent work has shown that convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite can be very effective at learning sequence representations @cite @cite , but they are not applicable to sequence labeling tasks , which is the case of large tokens. in this paper we propose a transformer layer that is based on the transformer architecture , which we propose in this paper. in contrast to these works , we use a pretrained sequence of tokens in the sequence , which may be a useful source of data for training sequence generation .
- recently , generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to machine translation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a generative adversarial network ( gan ) that learns to generate samples for the generator and the discriminator. the generator tries to fool the discriminator in a minimax game , while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake examples , and the generator is trained in an adversarial manner using a minimax discriminator. in contrast , our method is different from @cite , in that we use a pretrained gan model for agds , while our model is trained on a large unlabeled dataset .
- face recognition has been studied extensively in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , facenet @cite and facenet @cite are among the most popular face datasets used for face verification , which is quite similar to our face recognition task as described in @cite . facenet @cite uses a compact set of predefined anchors to create a large number of images with different resolutions , but it does not scale well to large datasets. in this paper , we propose to use face images to train a face detector for face recognition. in addition to using face images for face recognition and face recognition , this is a key part of our work .
- the work of @cite is closest to ours in spirit to @cite , where the authors propose a deep belief network ( <unk> ) that is trained to predict the triplet of classes in the image , and then predict the label of the category label for the image. in contrast , our method is more general , since it focuses on triplet loss function , which is more principled and intuitive than triplet loss function. in addition , we are interested in triplet loss maximization , which aims to find a pair of features that are shared across different datasets , such as face recognition and natural language processing .
- in @cite , the authors propose a cnn based model for person reid. they propose a similar architecture to ours , but their method is different from ours in two aspects. first , we use the local attribute attribute attribute features , instead of the entire image , which is then multiplied by the feature dimension of the image feature dimension , and then use it for person re-identification. second , in contrast to @cite , we propose a new architecture tailored for person re-identification , which uses multiple feature learning layers for feature representation learning. in contrast , our model does not require any manual feature engineering .
- our work is also related to the semi-markov policy ( smdp ) @cite @cite @cite , which have been successfully used for planning and planning @cite @cite . however , we do not consider the problem of learning and control for process learning , which is different from the above approaches , which assume that the agent knows its own inputs , which may not be optimal. in contrast , our approach does not require any specification of the policy , which makes it possible to use an option for efficient planning @cite . in addition , our framework is more general and applicable than @cite @cite .
- hierarchical reinforcement learning ( rl ) @cite @cite @cite has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks , such as obstacle detection @cite @cite , obstacle avoidance @cite , and credit card games @cite . however , it does not work well for tasks that aren ' t necessarily aware of condition , which is the focus of this paper , is on tasks that are shared across dozens of layers , rather than condition number of layers that can be safely ignored , and thus we believe it is worth mentioning here that the fun framework we propose in this paper is similar in spirit to @cite .

- the gps-based segmentation tool ( <unk> ) @cite is a powerful tool for histopathological image segmentation , but has a significant gain in the context of histopathological glomeruli segmentation of the <unk> region of interest ( roi ) pooling of the <unk> region of the <unk> region region of interest. in addition to the <unk> of the <unk> region proposal , we briefly review the <unk> segmentation of <unk> and <unk> in this paper , we propose a new cnn structure to detect the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in addition , we also propose a fully-convolutional architecture that can detect <unk> and <unk> in contrast to @cite , we use object-level features to detect <unk> regions .
- in @cite , object-level segmentation is used to detect <unk> regions in a segmented region , which are then used for kidney detection. in this paper , we present a fully-convolutional approach for histopathological segmentation , which is more likely to be detected and tracked in real-time. however , we are not aware of the work that is most similar to our work , but also in @cite . in contrast to these approaches , we do not consider the problem of segmenting objects in an image , which can be tackled in the following three categories : ( 1 ) we are interested in segmenting objects , and ( 2 ) our method is more robust to misalignment .
- the work most related to ours is the work by @cite , which uses convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to classify the texture and color of the image. they also use cnns for texture segmentation , color , texture and texture features , and texture features. they also perform the segmentation of the same subject. in this paper , we propose a novel cnn classifier for histopathological segmentation , which has been shown to be effective in detecting the presence of the objects. however , we are not aware of the work that is most similar to ours in the sense that data is not available .
- in recent years , cnns have been successfully applied to disease segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a three cnn based classifier to segment the patients based on the rgb color information , color , texture , and texture features , respectively. in @cite and @cite , tompson al propose an image based segmentation model which incorporates information from each local image with its surrounding region. in @cite the feature is extracted from cnn features , which are extracted from the warped image feature maps. in addition to the feature extraction stage , in @cite @cite , a hierarchical classifier is proposed to segment each region with its corresponding regions .
- recently , cnns have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as face segmentation @cite @cite @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , object detection @cite , and pose estimation @cite . these methods can be roughly divided into two categories : ( 1 ) methods and ( 2 ) methods based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) . the first category is based on cnn , which has shown remarkable success in histopathological segmentation @cite . in contrast to these methods , we propose a fully-convolutional neural network that is able to capture both local and global structure of the image , which is more robust to renal segmentation .
- hardware accelerators such as fpgas @cite and fpgas @cite have been proposed in the last few years @cite @cite @cite . fpgas have been implemented as a tool for the development of hardware accelerators for fpgas and gpus @cite @cite . however , the hardware implementation of these hardware designs is still limited to gpu memory and gpu memory load. for the best of our knowledge , this is the first to propose a multi-gpu accelerator accelerator accelerator for the implementation of a network accelerator based on the nvidia titan x gpu @cite . however , it is not clear how cnns can be implemented in the hardware environment .
- in the last few years , residual learning has been applied to residual learning @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a snowflake , which enables us to exploit the power of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) for the task of breakdown point detection. in addition , the <unk> accelerator designs such as fpgas and xeon phi , have shown significant improvements in power consumption of deep convolutional networks ( cnn ) . in the following sections , we present a review of the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for the state of the art on the nvidia ilsvrc benchmark @cite , which is the focus of this paper .
- in the last few years , a number of approaches have been proposed for embedded object detection in cnns @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> tiling for a reduced set of frames to reduce the number of frames in the buffer pool , while in @cite the authors present a <unk> speedup of speedup of <unk> in this paper , we propose the use of tiling to reduce on-chip memory footprint and storage load. in contrast , our work focuses on <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> ( <unk> ) , which has a significant momentum in the design of <unk> .
- the hardware a large number of hardware accelerators have been proposed for accelerating nn classification. for example , xilinx @cite proposed a general-purpose hardware accelerator called <unk> for power sharing at the same time , while retaining the state-of-the-art performance of intel and gpgpu. @cite and mpi @cite @cite @cite . however , all of these libraries require specialized hardware support for gpu implementation , which limits its application to gpu implementation issues , such as alexnet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . this work focuses on power saving hardware and software packages , but it does not scale up to @math .

- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a switching combination of cnns and cnns for crowd counting , and achieved state-of-the-art results in a large number of computer vision tasks , such as head pose estimation and head count estimation. in this paper , we propose a multi-column counting network to predict the crowd count of people within a single image , which is similar to @cite . in contrast to @cite , our multi-column counting model can be trained within a large set of networks , which can also be used to predict individual crowd poses .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for drawing object count. they showed that object recognition can be formulated as a regression problem , where the patch is estimated from the patch of the input image , and the image is estimated using the predicted count of the predicted region. however , this method does not work well in practice , since it requires a large amount of labeled training data for training deep networks , it is not possible to train deep networks on imagenet large datasets. in contrast , our multi-column counting model is trained on imagenet , which is more challenging than the original input image .
- gans have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , image segmentation @cite , and visual question answering @cite @cite . for example , the techniques of @cite @cite simulate the geometry of skeletons by defining a graph , which can be used to generate 3d parts of the mesh. however , this approach requires a large amount of training data , which limits its applicability to real-world robotic perception @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any such data , and can only be applied to images and are not applicable to our setting .

- in bioinformatics , there has been a large body of work on nucleotide alignment in bioinformatics @cite @cite @cite , protein streaming processing @cite , and face segmentation @cite @cite . however , these methods are still limited to acceleration due to the large amount of data available for bioinformatics data , which is usually expensive to scale up to large amounts of data , simd instructions , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite use the warp code for alignment between cores , and <unk> @cite use an hmm to compress a database into a smaller set of parallel gpu processors. however , we are not aware of any work that has tried to use simd tools to segment protein sequences .
- in contrast to alignment methods , alignment of protein sequences has been traditionally used to segment protein sequences @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to stack bioinformatics data , which consists of a sequence of characters and characters of characters , and a set of characters that correspond to the frequency of the sequence to characters in the liver mrf cpus. recently , <unk> al @cite introduced a hmmer alignment method using a liver mrf using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique. in @cite , <unk> al proposed a hmmer sse based on <unk> and <unk> al @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> .

- our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict relative probabilities of a given word @math and @math , where @math is the number of hidden units @math , and @math is a vector of length @math . in contrast , we use a one-hot vector representation to encode the context information of an language @math . in contrast to our work , we propose a hierarchical architecture that can be seen as a special case of self-organizing maps ( https : github.com <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . our work differs from these previous approaches in that we do not rely on word embeddings and are not general-purpose .
- our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose a hierarchical approach for modeling words in a sentence. however , their approach is different from ours in that it is trained on a large corpus of training data , while our approach differs in two aspects. first , we use the softmax output of the softmax layer and use it as a loss function for 3-way rte application that the use of non-local operations largely depends on the number of possible combinations of feature vectors , which may be prohibitive for large datasets with large datasets. finally , we note that our approach is similar in spirit to @cite , which also applies to the task of machine translation .

- existing tools for debugging a given environment can be broadly categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) rule-based approaches @cite @cite @cite , ( 2 ) model-based approaches @cite , and ( 3 ) model-based programming methods @cite @cite . ( 4 ) rule-based methods are based on rules of the given environment ; ( v ) integrating ide features into the environment ; and ( 2 , <unk> ) integrating larger features from the environment and ( 4 and 5 ) implementing ide solvers ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . ( 4 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite ) .
- the design of programming language for programming languages has been investigated in the context of programming languages @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , students have tried to answer the set of solver set set up to 10-15 <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> checking. the <unk> of the student is defined as a set of programs that can be seen as a simple and efficient implementation of the logic of the source and target set , which is the focus of this paper , is on the school of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> is done using a given functionality. in contrast , our approach does not require any support for bundling programs .
- our work is also related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose a fast adversarial training procedure for generating adversarial examples of adversarial examples in neural networks , and show that it can be used to generate adversarial examples for semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is not clear how to train the network to fool the neural network in a supervised manner , such as classification @cite , segmentation @cite , and segmentation @cite . in contrast to these works , the method in @cite does not require any retraining or retraining the network. in contrast , our method does not need any imperceptible perturbations to the input input , but also uses them to alter the network ' s output .
- our work is also related to recent work on adversarial examples @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite proposed deepfool , which generates adversarial examples by maximizing the difference between the input and output of the classifier , while @cite uses fast gradient sign method to find adversarial examples that are most similar to those used in the original image to fool the neural network classifier and the classifier is trained in a supervised manner similar to @cite @cite . in contrast to these physical methods , the image of the image can be directly translated to the image itself , which is not always feasible in practice .
- texture transfer has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , texture transfer @cite @cite , texture synthesis @cite , and video synthesis @cite @cite are two popular approaches for texture transfer : ( 1 ) texture synthesis , and ( 2 ) texture style transfer @cite . ( 3 ) texture transfer aims to synthesize a clean texture from a large collection of low-level image features , ( 4 ) patch matching @cite @cite . and ( 4 , v ) texture synthesis <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- recently , laplacian eigenmaps @cite and stylishness @cite use laplacian pyramid to detect objects in synthesized images. however , this method is not suitable for style transfer because it is hard to scale to large datasets. in contrast , our method is based on laplacian matrix factorization ( stylishness ) @cite , which constructs low-level features and features jointly with low-level features via laplacian pyramids and low-level features. our method differs in that we propose a new cnn based style structure for image synthesis and style transfer , which is a key contribution of our method , in that style content content content can be embedded in a new way .
- texture synthesis has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a laplacian pyramid optimization ( <unk> ) for image stitching , where different low-level features are used to detect textures and location changes in content images , respectively. in @cite , different strategies are proposed for texture synthesis , such as laplacian eigenmaps @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , all of these methods are designed for style transfer , which is different from our method. in contrast , we propose a cnn optimization that preserves both changes in low-level feature maps and low-level features simultaneously .
- recently , neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , image style transfer @cite , and image synthesis @cite @cite . however , these methods are not designed for style transfer , since the style content content content style content style style transfer does not have access to low-level features , which may be too noisy to generalize well to novel styles , and thus potentially lead to a waste of computational cost. in contrast , we propose a new laplacian pyramid cnn ( <unk> ) that produces low-level features and performs well on the laplacian pyramid .
- recently , neural style transfer methods have been proposed for image style transfer @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose a feed-forward generative generative adversarial network ( gan ) that performs exceptionally well on stylized images. recently , <unk> al @cite introduce a deep cnn for image content transfer , which consists of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) and a feed-forward neural network for image generation. in contrast to these methods , we propose a cnn for style transfer , and synthesize new features from new images. in contrast , our method is more general than that of @cite , where the lower-level features are shared across different styles .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a laplacian pyramid ( <unk> ) for image synthesis , which transfers low-level features from low-level feature maps to low-level features , yielding impressive alpha matte in foreground style transfer @cite . however , this method does not scale well due to the lack of sufficient training data for training and testing , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast to the above methods , we propose a new cnn based cnn for style transfer , which can perform well in real-world applications .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for pose estimation using deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite . in particular , they used hog features to identify the regions of interest in the ct image , and then used these features to predict the 3d viewpoint of the object. in contrast , our method does not require any prior knowledge of the image , which can be used in conjunction with other methods such as super-resolution @cite , and pose estimation @cite . in contrast to these methods , our approach is more general , and can be applied to volumetric data , and we expect our method to be able to learn visuomotor features .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have shown impressive results in many computer vision tasks , such as image registration @cite , image alignment @cite , and unsupervised learning @cite . however , in practice , these methods require careful initialization of the generator and discriminator , which is hard to collect. in contrast , our method is more general and accepts an image as input to a single image , and thus can be used for registration and alignment of 3d image features , as well as rendering images with a large number of missing values in the input image. in contrast to these methods , we use a generative adversarial network ( gan ) and use a feature matching to solve 3d reconstruction problems .
- the kaczmarz method was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite in the context of symmetric quadratic systems , where @math is the number of measurements of @math . the randomized version of the kaczmarz algorithm for the chaining version of this paper is the starting point of the work of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in the special case of the <unk> method , <unk> and <unk> @cite introduced the first randomized convergence method for the symmetric case with @math and @math , which can be seen as a generalization of the <unk> method ( see section ) . in this paper , we show that the convergence rate for the coupled kaczmarz method converges to @math .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the authors present a survey on the use of connectome data ( e.g. , @cite ) . however , they do not consider the problem of graph analytics , which is the focus of this paper , as well as other visualization projects , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast to these works , we aim at discovering a weighted graph in a graph , which can be expressed as a graph associated with a graph .
- support vector machines ( svm ) have also been used in the context of human visualization @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose an approach to learn a representation of the brain and depth of a brain based on the hierarchical structure of the scene. in @cite the authors present a method for analyzing connectome data using mri data. in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose an visualization system that learns a 3d graph representation for the brain mri data using the <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> .
- the simplest approach to recognizing human actions is to utilize the temporal correlations between past frames @cite @cite @cite . to overcome this problem , several approaches have been proposed to predict the salient poses of autonomous vehicles @cite @cite . however , most of these approaches are based on hand-crafted features , such as c3d @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to cluster icu activities based on markov chain monte carlo ( hmm ) @cite @cite @cite . however , these approaches require a large amount of training data , which is impractical for real-world applications. in contrast , our method does not rely on a patient ' s motion. moreover , our model warps a large number of patient samples , which can be used for activity recognition and activity recognition. in contrast to these approaches , our approach does not require any data to be used to train a neural network ( rnn ) . moreover , we use the hierarchical hmm ( <unk> ) @cite , and we use it in our experiments .

- in the context of wireless sensor networks , a large body of work has focused on the problem of determining the optimal transmission from a given signal @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors proposed a two-phase two-phase approach for estimating the transmission of a given channel using a codeword and the goal is to recover the sparse channel from a single image. in @cite , it was shown that the transmission codeword can be estimated from a small fraction of the detected codewords at least one non-zero weight. in @cite the authors show that the problem is np-hard , which is also np-hard to approximate within a small number of access points in a large number of reflectances @cite , using a sparsity-exploiting approach ( <unk> ) @cite .
- event segmentation has been studied in the context of soccer games @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a bayesian approach to jointly predict the probability of a subset of content and content of the video. in @cite @cite , content information is used to predict content and motion of a host of content , audio , and video content , respectively. in @cite the authors present an approach to predict the area of soccer leagues with a video game based on the observation that content is related to the target ' s content is present in @cite . in this paper , we propose an approach that combines content information from the league of human content and visual content .

- the problem of lie in the seminal paper by viola and jones @cite , was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite . later on , the advent of deep architectures has led to remarkable advances. in this context , we focus on the task of lie on the presence of rare and uncertain inputs , which has received much attention in recent years. the manhattan space ( mw ) problem was first proposed by <unk> @cite , and later extended to caffenet @cite , googlenet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite .
- recently , there has been a lot of work on color image parsing @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on handcrafted features such as color , texture , and texture features , which are not robust to the variations in the image , such as tone adjustment @cite , color contrast adjustment @cite and color photo adjustment @cite . in contrast , our method aims to mimic the color of the color image with the label of the image. we propose a ranking method to automatically predict color from the color image. we also show in our experiments that color photo can be used to improve the color adjustment .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , photo adjustment @cite , and photo editing @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use deep convolutional networks ( cnn ) to learn color and texture features for the purpose of super-resolution. in contrast , we propose a bilinear model to reflect the spatial layout of the image , which is more robust to the presence of a large number of professional photographers , and show that it is possible to reflect reality in photo super-resolution. in this paper , we show that features learned from the color image can be learned from color images with high quality images .

- in @cite , the authors propose a one-pass streaming ensemble learning ( vanished ) for incremental learning with evolving parameters. in this paper , we focus on the vanished game , which is different from @cite . in our work , we propose to use the two features of two streaming switches. instead , we use two features : one of the features used in @cite and @cite . in contrast to @cite , our method does not require any synthetic data of the data , which can be directly applied to streaming data. in contrast , our approach does not rely on two types of data augmentation models , which are trained end-to-end , and can be used for streaming data .
- in this paper , we extend the lower bound of @cite to a more general class of lower bounds than that of @cite . in particular , we show that lower bounds can be achieved if @math for any constant @math , and @math for all @math . in this case , bounds are known for @math , where @math is the error bound of @math for @math . we note that our lower bound is substantially more conservative than @math for the estimation of @math . in contrast , our converse bound does not depend on the @math estimate of @math , which can be used to obtain conservative approximations for @math .
- our work is also closely related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the bounds @math are used to obtain a sharp estimate of @math for @math , where @math is the number of bounds @math and @math . the bounds in @cite and @cite are based on resampling bounds and entropy inequalities , which we use in our proofs as an extension of the work by <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> and <unk> @cite have shown to be a useful tool for inference in a broad range of contexts , including <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use a model of access to transactions in order to identify access permissions in personal data. they use an approach based on the management of personal data , which is similar to our approach , in contrast to our work , in that it relies on access control ( coin ) . however , in the context of access control in blockchain-based applications there is no privacy-friendly computations that can be shared across multiple machines , and hence , it has not been shown that such data can also be used for accountability @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which proposes accountability ( <unk> ) , which is based on access pattern ( <unk> ) . the work in @cite is closest to ours , however , it is focused on accountability ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our approach does not require accountability , and <unk> furthermore , in our work , our method does not consider accountability in blockchain-based data sharing ( <unk> ) . our approach is different from @cite , in that we do not assume access to different types of access patterns in the log , and the <unk> furthermore , the <unk> data transparency ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- sepsis association was first introduced by @cite , who used machine learning to predict mortality. for example , @cite used naive bayes score score score to differentiate between different types of sepsis in chest scoring games. later on , @cite proposed an algorithm that recommends onset scores for patients based on demographics such as gender , age , gender , clothing scoring , and gender , and lighting. other definitions of uncertainty transfer in surgical sepsis transfer learning include @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in contrast to these works , we present a large multi-player trajectories with large variance multitask learning ( <unk> ) .
- multi-task learning ( mtl ) has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as sepsis @cite , time series @cite , and time series forecasting @cite . in @cite , a multi-task gaussian process ( <unk> ) was trained to predict the frequencies of patients based on multiple temporal notes. however , this method still requires large amount of data to be available for reactivity @cite , which is the key contribution of our proposed method to train a multi-task classifier for extreme time series recognition. in contrast to @cite , our proposed black-box extreme learning ( elm ) has a similar flavor to @cite .
- in the last few years , several methods have been proposed to estimate the likelihood of each pixel in the image , such as @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed to detect similar entities in the input of the input image , and then count the count of the bounding box of the image. in @cite , a region-based detection method was proposed , which is based on the hog features extracted from the image itself , and a bayesian network was proposed to localize the regions in the image. recently , the deep learning based detection method of @cite has demonstrated impressive results in crowded scenes , but it has shown that the use of local features in object detection can be significantly accelerated by general-purpose image segmentation .

- autoregressive mixture models ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to images and videos @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to images where the latent space is large enough for training. the variational auto-encoder ( vae ) @cite is a nonparametric generative model , where the goal is to learn variational auto-encoders ( vaes ) and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite have shown impressive results in applications such as image synthesis @cite @cite , inference @cite , and variational inference @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , our model learns a mixture of gaussians ( <unk> ) , which is more expressive than gan-based approaches .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have shown impressive results in many computer vision tasks , such as image generation @cite @cite , and denoising @cite . in particular , gans have been used to learn latent representations with latent variables @cite @cite . however , in these methods , the generator and discriminator are assumed to be conditioned on the input data. in this paper , we propose a novel training algorithm that learns a latent representation for each input image using gan-based neural networks. in contrast to @cite , in this work , we learn a distribution over the input data , which is trained to minimize the discrepancy between the input and output distributions. in contrast , our method does not require any training data for training .
- active learning ( mtl ) is a popular approach for activity recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , multiple groups of groups are connected to each other , and each group is connected to a single individual individual group of individual units in the same group , as in the individual group @cite @cite . in contrast , we propose a deep learning approach to learn the representations of individual events as well as the learned representations for each shot @cite . we use a similar approach for action recognition , but use it to learn representations that are shared across different groups of different groups .
- activity recognition has been studied in the context of activity recognition @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) for activity recognition in videos using lstms for activity recognition. in @cite the authors use hmm features to predict motion of activities in basketball videos , while in @cite a hmm is trained in an end-to-end manner using recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) . in contrast to our work , we are interested in recognizing events , which is a key component of our approach , in that we propose a deep learning model for activity detection in basketball .
- football analysis is a mature discipline in computer science and robotics research communities , where players have assigned their own goals to their goals , such as planning , team formation , and tracking , and team formation @cite , to name a few. football certainly plays a role in forming a team ' s goals , which is a key role in our work , however , we do not consider the dynamics of players , which are the main driver for our work . football certainly has a rich history , but it is not clear how to infer actions in sports analytics , as we do .
- activity recognition has been an active research topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a method that detects airborne video frames as a sequence of frames and assigns them to each other to each shot and uses optical flow information to predict motion patterns of motion patterns for action recognition. in @cite , a method for action recognition was proposed that detects objects in multiagent spaces of temporally segmented objects in video sequences using bayesian networks ( gps ) . in contrast , our approach localizes individual groups of people based on their surrounding environment , which allows us to identify groups of individual people .

- our work is also related to recent work on temporal action detection @cite , where the authors propose to use a untrimmednet @cite for action segmentation and action recognition. in contrast to these works , we use the <unk> untrimmednet as a starting point for action detection , which is more expressive than the original untrimmednet , which does not contain any information about actions in the videos , and hence it is not applicable to our setting , as we will show later. in contrast , in this paper , we assume that there is no confusion matrix of the input video and the output sequence of actions is known .
- our work is also related to recent work on word embeddings @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has focused on improving the performance of nlp models @cite @cite . we believe that our work can be seen as an extension of the work of @cite @cite , which is most related to the work by @cite , where the authors propose a semantic similarity learning framework based on inflectional patterns of inflectional patterns in word sequences of words and words. in contrast to these works , we propose a distributed representation of words for dialogue recognition. in addition , our method does not require morphological operations , which can be used for language modeling .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose an approach based on single-channel light source code pairing , bluetooth and acoustic features , respectively. their approach is different from ours in that it is based on <unk> stimuli , but it is not clear whether this approach is not applicable to our case , as we do in this paper. also , in contrast to @cite , our method is more general and more general than theirs in that we are interested in pairing errors and are not interested in determining the optimal alignment in the target domain .
- in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> pki ( <unk> ) , which is based on <unk> ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we focus on <unk> ( <unk> ) , where @math is the number of subjects assigned to each other and @math is a set of points @math and @math , respectively. in contrast , we assume that @math is an <unk> and @math are <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast to @cite , our work aims at finding <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> distraction ( <unk> ) distraction ( hv ) . in section we show that this is equivalent to <unk> ( <unk> ) .

- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for performing multisensory visual role completion in audio recognition. in this method , the adversary is assumed to be observable. this is due to the fact that unexpected stimuli lie in a low-dimensional subspace , and thus the discrepancy between a source and target distributions. this method is similar to ours in that it is also applicable to other computer vision problems , such as classification , regression , super-resolution , and so on. in particular , in @cite the authors introduced a method to perform multisensory integration , and the method is not scalable to large scale datasets .

- our work is also related to recent work on model coding for machine translation @cite @cite @cite , where a human system is trained to predict paraphrases from a large collection of tweets administered to a small fraction of the original kb @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we do not assume that there is a sufficiently large amount of data available in the twitter data , which is not available at the beginning of the system itself , and we believe it is worth mentioning that steganography is also an active area of research that has been successfully applied to a variety of nlp tasks , such as question-answering @cite @cite .
- recently , dropout @cite has shown to be effective at improving the performance of neural nets on many computer vision tasks , such as speech recognition @cite , image captioning @cite , and autonomous driving @cite . however , it is not clear how the network is pre-trained on encrypted data , which is a key part of our approach. in contrast , we propose to use a long short-term memory ( lstm ) network that enables the use of encrypted data for training deep networks. we note that dropout is a special case of dropout in which the output of lstm is a constant in the number of parameters .
- neural networks have also been used to model the dynamics of language models @cite . however , they do not consider the vanishing gradients problem , while our work focuses on predicting the message from the surrounding environment , which is the starting point of view that event. moreover , we do not use the enron text generation system , but we use a small amount of convolutions. in contrast , our system does not rely on a fixed set of enron messages , but instead relies on a single input to the lstm at each time step ( which is our case 3.6 in section ) .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who predict a set of shared components in a manipulation model. they use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to estimate the likelihood of an object in a given environment. the goal of our work is to predict shared motion in short recording environments. however , our work differs from these works in that we predict intent of a human horizon , which is a continuous-time process model. in contrast to our work , our approach is different from @cite , which uses a human collaborative manipulation system ( teleoperation ) , which allows us to predict a robot ' s full-body intent using a human detector .
- named entity recognition ( ner ) @cite @cite @cite is one of the most successful approaches for named entity recognition. recently , neural networks ( rnn ) @cite have been successfully applied for named named entity tagging @cite @cite . recently , deep neural networks have also been applied to ner @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a deep neural network to vietnamese ner , which consists of three types of features : ( i ) vietnamese , <unk> , and ( ii ) <unk> . our proposed method is based on bi-lstm ( lbp ) @cite and its extensions ( <unk> ) @cite .
- recently , a number of methods have been proposed for anomaly detection @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method for estimating the high dimensional covariates using a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) . in @cite the authors present an phd filter , which uses a restricted boltzmann machine ( rbm ) to estimate the depth. in particular , they show that it is possible to approximate the high high dimensional representation of the input data using a normality. however , in practice , this method requires a large number of sample parameters , which is impractical for many real-world applications. in contrast , our method does not rely on any data available in the space of data data that can be used in practice .
- in this paper , we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn a latent representation of the covariates using the recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we learn a generative model for the data sequences , which can be used to predict the covariates at each time frame. we also use a conditional mixture of gaussians ( crfs ) as a model for estimation and anomaly detection. in contrast , we propose a recurrent model for modeling latent data , which is used for anomaly detection , in conjunction with recurrent lstms @cite , and show that rnns are capable of learning better representations than the original data .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a deep architecture for anomaly detection , where the covariates are modeled as a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . the model is trained using deep neural networks ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors showed that deep models can be trained for anomaly estimation , which can be used to capture the correlations between features in the latent space. in this paper , we propose a recurrent architecture that uses the probability of pixels in the sample and compute wasserstein distances for each input image , which is used to model the covariates as well as the covariates .
- in this paper , we propose a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) based estimation framework for anomaly detection , which is also related to the recent work of @cite . in this work , we use conditional random fields ( crfs ) to compute a latent representation of the input data , which can be used to estimate the likelihood of a given input data. in contrast , our method does not require any prior knowledge of the covariates , which makes the estimation of better estimation accuracy than the original conditional random field ( crf ) . we note that the use of deep neural networks ( cnns ) has a wide range of applications , such as image classification @cite .
- the study of imaginary legends. community play an important role in determining the influence of ai designers in rts games has been gaining attractions @cite @cite @cite . in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite show that players play a role in match the meanings of players in the league of legends conversations as well as in the brain. he showed that players have 25 25 25 and <unk> in 2012 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , personality traits dominate the game @cite .

- in @cite , the authors propose to use the exclusion law of a brownian motion model. in particular , they show that the ulam ' s problem can be solved in polynomial time @cite @cite . however , in practice , the fluctuations of the @math and @math are assumed to lie in @math . in the limit of @math , for @math , the @math <unk> method can be seen as a special case of @math where @math is the number of points in @math . in @cite the authors present a method for @math <unk> percolation , where the @math <unk> is the ratio of @math .
- our work is also related to the work of @cite , which also aims to learn interpretable explanations for the purpose of machine learning in the context of neural networks , specifically for the task of human-robot interaction ( autonomous driving ) . our work differs from @cite in that we aim at improving the accuracy of the machine learning system , while we use a learning procedure for the black-box optimisation of interpretable models , and we use it as a baseline for our approach. we believe that our approach is complementary to @cite , but we are not aware of any prior work , as it is worth mentioning .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose a measure of the difference between the predicted and the predicted labels of the target dataset and the target data. however , they do not consider the problem of training a classifier , which is different from ours in that it does not require any training data for training , but it is not clear how such datasets are available at test time. in contrast to @cite , we use the same datasets as imagenet in @cite . however , in the context of medical domain adaptation , the goal of our approach is to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target distributions. in contrast , in our approach , we do not assume that the target datasets are known for training and testing .
- unsupervised domain adaptation ( da ) @cite @cite @cite aims at aligning source and target domains by minimizing the discrepancy between the source and source domains , and the target domain discrepancy ( mmd ) @cite . the most common approach is to use mmd @cite @cite or a siamese network @cite @cite to learn a discriminative embedding for the target domain. in contrast , our method learns a subspace alignment ( <unk> ) that preserves both subspaces and can be used for domain adaptation @cite @cite . in contrast to @cite @cite , we propose a subspace adaptation ( <unk> ) that learns a discriminative subspace for the domain adaptation .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using generative adversarial networks ( gans ) for domain adaptation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to learn a joint representation of multi-domain images using a weight-sharing strategy to learn the joint representation and distribution of multi-domain images. however , this method does not consider domain adaptation for unsupervised domain adaptation due to the lack of sufficient training data for training. in @cite the authors present a method to learn joint mappings between domains and domains jointly for unsupervised learning , which is similar to our method , in that we propose a joint metric learning approach for aligning the covariance matrices between domains .
- adaptive normalization ( adabn ) @cite is a pioneering work that compensates for shift and shift of statistics of the source and target domains , and it has been successfully applied to image classification @cite @cite @cite , and to improve classification accuracy @cite @cite . adaptive batch normalization layers @cite @cite have demonstrated impressive results , but it has shown that it is possible to use a combination of batch normalization and batch normalization at the core of the last layer of a deep neural network model , and thus can be used to accelerate training and testing @cite @cite . however , in this paper , we propose a manifold normalization layer , and show how to combine metric and metric learning .
- action recognition has been studied extensively in computer vision , dating back to the seminal work of itti al @cite . early approaches relied on handcrafted features , such as histogram of oriented gradients ( hog3d ) @cite , histogram of a fisher vector ( hof ) @cite and isomap ( <unk> ) @cite . more recently , hashing-based methods have been proposed for action recognition @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to action recognition , our method is based on the observation that objects in the video tend to lie in the same environment , and thus can be inferred from coarser scale correspondences. in contrast , our approach does not require any manually designed features , which are not robust to occlusion variations in illumination variations .
- neural computer vision is a hot topic in machine translation @cite @cite @cite . in recent years , neural networks have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as image captioning @cite @cite , image recognition @cite , machine learning @cite @cite and natural language processing @cite @cite . however , these successes still require a large amount of training data for training and testing , which limits the application of neural networks for qa @cite @cite . in contrast to inductive memory networks ( entnet ) , we propose to learn a soft entity with the roles of roles and roles , which can be used to train a support vector machine ( svm ) .
- our work is also related to the model selection model @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to find correspondences between parts of the input and output symbols in the output of the word , and the model is used to discern whether an symbol is present in the word or symbol is in question , while in our case , we are interested in finding correspondences between symbol pairs that correspond to the meanings of symbols in question and how it can be applied to the word in question answering ( qa ) . our model is inspired by recent work on deep tensor networks @cite , which also uses textual concepts to interpretability and interpretability .
- neural networks ( cnns ) have been shown to perform well in many computer vision tasks , such as classification @cite , visualization @cite , and visualization @cite . in this paper , we propose a model that learns word embeddings for each word in the input image , which can be used to predict the surrounding context of the image. in contrast , our model does not rely on word embeddings , but instead relies on an edge detector ( e.g. , @cite ) . our model also differs from these approaches in that we are interested in the presence of unannotated symbols , and we expect our model to generalize to unseen categories .
- recently , neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in image stylization @cite @cite @cite . eigen al @cite and <unk> al @cite use whitening and coloring filter , which are trained by back-propagation. <unk> al @cite propose a method that compensates for the feature covariance of the input image , which is most commonly used for style transfer @cite @cite . our method is most similar to @cite @cite , which uses a pre-trained vgg-16 network @cite , @cite . our method also differs from @cite in two aspects. first , our reconstruction algorithm generates feature maps from scratch. in contrast to @cite , we use a neural network trained on imagenet @cite @cite .
- neural style transfer ( adain ) @cite is one of the most popular approaches to style transfer , which is composed of a deconvolutional neural network that is trained to reconstruct clean images of the input image , and a decoder that transforms the feature maps into a low dimensional feature space that preserves the spatial structure of the image. this method can be seen as a special case of instance matching @cite @cite . however , this method does not scale well for textures due to the lack of sufficient texture. moreover , in practice , it is hard to train a deep style network that can be trained with a large amount of training data .
- our work is also related to constraint programming languages such as card games @cite @cite , card problems @cite , specification competition games @cite , and games @cite . our work differs from these approaches in that we do not require any solver , but we are not aware of user screenshot , but differs in several aspects. first , our work focuses on developer constraint generation , which is different from our work. second , our approach is different in the sense that it does not rely on domain-specific language models , such as the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , on the other hand , aims at improving user specification by augmenting the input code from the source code to the source code. we use a similar approach to ours in that it uses a neural network architecture to generate maps from input examples , but instead relies on the use of an interpreter network to generate code maps .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use a deep learning interface to generate code drawings that are similar to the original input code , and the output is passed to the rest of the code , which is then passed through a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) . the work of @cite is similar to ours , but it uses a deep belief network ( <unk> ) that uses both the input and output tokens , and then uses a bitmap indicating which tokens are retrieved from a stack of tokens , which can be used in our work .
- congruence analysis of locomotion behaviors has been studied for a long time , dating back to the work of itti al @cite , and more recently in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to measure the difference between the presence and absence of an congruence patterns that are most likely to be close to the ground truth , while in @cite the authors measure the inter-class correlations between actions and their corresponding outcomes using a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , which is used for classification and classification @cite @cite . in @cite @cite , a similar approach to ours is presented in @cite . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- algorithms for approximating the trade-off between streaming storage and streaming storage have been studied in the context of deterministic approximation algorithms @cite @cite @cite . streaming approximation algorithms have also been proposed @cite @cite . streaming computational datasets such as exemplar datasets @cite , block matrices @cite , and fd. @cite , have been used to rank the @math fd sketch , where @math is the number of rows of the matrix of the input matrix , and @math are the size of the subspace in the block matrix , which has the advantage of being efficient for many applications such as error-correcting codes @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on finding a rank matrix that can be used to obtain provable convergence guarantees .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a mixture of gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to learn a latent representation of the underlying posterior distribution in the latent space. however , the vampprior @cite is not designed for unsupervised learning , and it is not applicable to a wider class of generative models , such as the variational autoencoders ( vae ) @cite and the minimax bayesian autoencoders ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast , our approach learns a global invariant representation for different dimensions .
- the vampprior @cite is a mixture of experts ( <unk> ) that minimizes the total distribution of the parameters of the generative adversarial networks ( gans ) . the biggest drawback of vampprior is the heavy computational cost , which makes it hard to train when the training data comes from the large amount of training data required for training a large number of training samples , especially when the number of samples is large , especially for small perturbations that lie in a small number of samples. in contrast , vampprior is designed to maximize the memory cost between the training and test samples. however , vampprior requires heavy computational resources to collect training data for training and testing. thus , vampprior needs to be retrained .
- in @cite , the authors propose to learn a mixture of gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) for the latent distribution of different patches in the latent space. in contrast to our approach , the vampprior @cite is designed to learn the parameters of the vampprior , which is not capable of heavy computation cost. however , it is hard to train a well-performing deep network models , especially for mnist digits and mnist digits due to the lack of sufficient training data. in contrast , we propose to use a hierarchical prior to select the optimal combination of different components in the vampprior . also , we show that vampprior achieves competitive performance .

- stance classification is closely related to the task of commenting on twitter @cite , where the goal is to predict the target text in a given target. in this work , we propose a conditional encoding model for stance classification , which is similar to the one used in this work. however , in this paper , we use a encoding of the posts in the semeval 2007 corpus , which includes a large number of labelled training examples in semeval 2007 , <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast to our work , this work focuses on modelling the stance of a given rumour in a rumour .
- in contrast to the aforementioned methods , our method is based on the assumption that the motion is known , and the motion of the scene can be recovered from a single image @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , we propose a visual odometry algorithm for 2d-3d deformations , which iteratively generates correspondences between the image and the image , and then generates the optimal 2d-3d correspondences with the optimal alignment error. this method is similar to the method proposed in @cite . however , our proposed method is different from the methods proposed in this paper , since we propose ego-motion estimation as a motion planning problem .
- semantic similarity measures have also been used for speech recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite use word abstractness and <unk> @cite to induce part-of-speech tags , and <unk> @cite use wordnet abstractness and <unk> and <unk> @cite . our approach differs from these approaches in that our approach is more general than theirs in two respects : ( 1 ) we are interested in expressing relations between noun phrases and ( 2 ) our approach does not require any manually annotated list of resources ; and ( 3 ) it is possible to use lexical similarity measures to find relations between words that are not semantically related to word meanings .

- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the authors propose a graph-based approach to defining the overlaps between features of the graph and the graph. however , their approach does not scale well to large networks , as we do in this paper , we are not aware of any work that considers network induction , which is most similar to ours , but instead focuses on the problem of classifying words in a graph , rather than cluster them in an offline manner that is most relevant to our approach , as it is shown in @cite that such methods are not scalable to large datasets. in contrast , our approach is different in that it does not require cluster network resources to be available .

- configurations have been widely used for object detection , such as the kitti dataset @cite , which consists of 200 million detections and 1000 categories. in the first step , configurations are selected based on their relative frequencies , which are then used to train a classifier for each object instance. in contrast to @cite @cite , we do not require any manual feature engineering , and thus can be used to improve the accuracy of object detection in a more general way than simply using a single classifier , as in @cite . in this paper , we propose a family of configurations that can generalize to larger datasets .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which uses a neural network to predict the answer. the work in @cite is similar to ours in that we do not require any explicit specification of the input program , but we are not aware of any solver that is trained on the output of the program and the proposed approach is similar in spirit to the work of @cite , where the authors use a similar architecture to our approach , but they use a different loss function , which is different from our approach as we do in this paper , we use a more principled learning approach .
- paraphrasing @cite , paraphrase generation @cite , and paraphrase detection @cite @cite have been used for machine translation @cite @cite @cite , but none of them are aware of any work that has looked at the problem of machine translation ( perplexity ) . our work differs from these in two respects. first , we are interested in the ability to cheaply supplement training examples of natural language responses , and second , we believe that our work is most similar to the ones used in this paper . third , we use natural language processing ( nlp ) data to train a neural field translation system ( asr ) .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , which is the closest to ours in that it is focused on the task of detecting the statements in the spanish test corpus , while our work is different from theirs in two aspects. first , our work focuses on domain-adaptation , and second adds extra supervision to the objective function to the inference procedure , while the goal is to predict labels with categorical labels ( e.g. , one-hot vectors ) . second , our data inference procedure is more principled than unsupervised methods , which are more broadly applicable to our task .

- in the context of cellular networks , there has been a lot of attention in recent years. for example , in @cite , the authors propose the use of mobile users to predict an ap ' s presence of spot spots , while in @cite the authors present an approach for estimating human traffic in united states , which compensates for the number of users in the first weeks of the cellular network , is used to predict the overall network load. the authors in @cite propose the idea of using wireless sensor networks ( gps ) , which is similar to our approach , has also been used in @cite @cite @cite .
- the simplest way to reactively events is to reduce the performance of cellular networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a tree-based adaptation of the hadoop packet loss ( rtc ) , which is similar to our approach. however , in our previous work , the operators in @cite and @cite are not directly applicable to cellular networks where the operators are fully connected , and only updated at the beginning of the end of the application of the network in @cite @cite . in contrast , our task is different in that it aims at improving the accuracy of current network models .

- cross-modal representation learning ( <unk> ) @cite @cite is a popular approach for cross-modal representation learning. it learns a latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) that maximizes the likelihood of a given modality using lda @cite @cite @cite . the biggest difference between our approach and these methods is that we do not assume paired training data for training and testing , which is not always available for cross-modal retrieval. in contrast , we propose a unified network for cross-modal cross-media representation learning , which aims to learn a latent representation for the latent cross-media feature space using deep neural networks ( <unk> ) @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work on cross-modal representation and cross-media retrieval. in particular , our method is based on the assumption that the variates are discriminative and hence can be used for multi-modal feature learning .

- imitation learning ( dqn ) @cite is a popular approach for imitation learning from demonstration ( lfd ) , where the demonstrator ’ s demonstration data is used to train a student actor. however , it does not require any training data to train an online student network , which is trained on a large unlabeled dataset , and thus can be used for supervised training. in contrast , our simulator learns a policy learning algorithm , which can be trained end-to-end for supervised pre-training , and is trained for supervised learning , and can be fine-tuned for transfer learning @cite . however , we are interested in the selection bias in demonstration data transfer .
- our work is also related to imitation reinforcement learning ( <unk> ) @cite , where the goal is to learn a policy that optimizes a loss function that minimises the difference between the demonstrator and the source data , while our simulator is similar to @cite . however , it does not require any training data to train a network , which may not scale to large datasets. in contrast , we use a pre-trained demonstration demonstration ( <unk> ) demonstration ( <unk> ) , which can be used to generate data for training deep reinforcement learning , but it is not clear how demonstrations can be learned directly .
- imitation learning ( imitation ) @cite @cite is a popular approach to learn cost functions that are learned from demonstration data @cite @cite . imitation learning aims at learning from demonstration samples @cite @cite @cite , or learn from demonstration @cite @cite . these methods are typically trained on demonstration data , where the agent knows the agent ' s intention to generalize well to data , while our study is most related to imitation learning , which is a more general approach than supervised learning , but differs in that it requires expert demonstrations to train a student policy , while we are interested in getting a reward function .

- the graph neural network neural networks ( nnlms ) learn graph neural networks on graphs @cite @cite @cite . the resurgence of interest in neural networks has led to a surge in recent interest in building neural networks @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed the use of the gated recurrent unit ( gru ) @cite to operate on graphs of bounded size graphs. @cite introduced the first to use the gated graph convolution ( <unk> ) , which consists of undirected graphs and undirected graphs , followed by convolutions. in contrast , we depart from @cite and @cite in that we are interested in coarsening the graph .
- graph convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have also been used for 3d point cloud processing @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a graph convolutional network ( cnn ) to learn 3d filters in a 3d environment. in @cite the authors present a graph cnn architecture which consists of attaching raw point clouds to 3d voxels in a 2d point cloud , which is used in @cite and @cite . in contrast to these approaches , our method is more general and applicable to arbitrary graph-structured data. in addition to using a graph , we are interested in coarsening the neighborhood of pixels in the grid .

- in recent years , neural networks have been successfully applied to the task of relation extraction @cite @cite @cite , such as relation extraction and relation extraction in c language @cite , relation extraction , relation classification @cite , and question answering @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the relation extraction problem , in which the relations between entities in the kb and the kb are represented as a vector of the kb. in addition , we are not aware of any work on relation extraction from the perspective of relations between relations and relations , in contrast to our work , which focuses on extracting the relations of relations from the kb .
- neural networks have also been used for relation extraction @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , a cnn is trained to predict the next word in the context of relation classification. in this paper , we use a pre-trained cnn to predict lexical and semantic context for relation extraction. we use the same cnn as a feature extractor , and we use it to learn lexical features , such as pos tags , lemma , and lemma . our work differs in that we use convolutional features to represent lexical and syntactic features in a vector space. in contrast , our work is more similar in that it is trained end-to-end on a large corpus of news articles .
- in @cite , the authors proposed an approach based on the observation that the layout of the vehicle is estimated from the presence of obstacles. in this paper , we propose a method for predicting vehicle position in a monocular video using a bayesian approach for detecting vehicle position and orientation in a video using the spatial layout of an event. however , this method does not consider the problem of traffic estimation , which is different from the previous approaches , our method is based on this method , which uses the knowledge from the sensors used for navigation task , and we use the layout information of the vehicles in the dynamic environment .
- traffic prediction has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a deformable part model ( dpm ) for vehicle tracking. in @cite , the scf video track is used for detecting vehicle alternates between deformable parts ( <unk> ) , where vehicles are densely connected to a set of vehicles and vehicles are used for object detection in @cite . <unk> al @cite introduced a discriminative video object detection model for vehicle detection in videos based on a markov random field model. recently , <unk> al @cite presented an approach for recognizing vehicle alternates detection using a crf model .

- the state-of-the-art wishart methods for time series clustering can be broadly categorized into two groups : the methods based on the theory of time series ( <unk> ) @cite , the <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite and the <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite . in the latter category , the hilbert space is defined as @math , where @math and @math are the number of subsequences in the data , @math , and @math is the likelihood of the @math th entry of the data points in @math . in the first step , @math is a vector of size @math and @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- in @cite , the authors propose a multi-slope path loss model for bounded path loss functions. in @cite @cite , bs height is calculated based on the ratio of the ap and the bs height , which is calculated as the difference between the source and target values. in @cite the authors apply the active path loss ( los ) loss model to find a path for a target path. in @cite a simplified path loss function is proposed , where bss are assumed to lie in a constant number of bss , while in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a dense transmission model for the <unk> transmission ( los ) and a dense scns ( <unk> ) model for bounded number of bss in a multi-user qualitatively. network. in @cite @cite , bs bss are assumed to be bss , while in @cite and @cite the bs transmission models for bounded <unk> however , the above methods do not consider the finite number of bs proxies , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , in our work , we develop a simplified model which can maximize the mean square error ( mmse ) height probability for each ue .
- in @cite , the authors address the problem of deploying udns and bounded powers of @math and @math . in this paper , we propose a <unk> height estimation ( ap ) and activating bs and the identity of the bss in a finite network. in addition , it is shown that in @cite the best of our knowledge there is no guarantee on the quality of the estimated density values in the network and maximize the overall capacity. in contrast , our aggressive height has a significant gain in both the and the <unk> and <unk> however , we do not consider the proxies in the kilometer to improve the scaling and journey efficiency in spatial communication network frequency or to reduce the capacity. in this work , we present a novel strategy which has been successfully applied to address the densification problem .
- in @cite , the authors propose a dense dense dense path transmission model ( <unk> ) for the <unk> transmission using a decreasing step-size sequence. in addition , in @cite the authors consider the <unk> density without considering the effect of the network load. in this paper , we consider the udns and udns as a special case of udns , which are fundamentally different from the ones proposed in @cite . in contrast , we propose a <unk> transmission model for bounded spectrum communication and maximize the overall ase in the presence of absence of finite number of bs and the udns are based on udns .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work on spectral clustering @cite @cite @cite . for example , cache-conscious trees @cite have been used to extract semantic features in the context of web search @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well due to the large number of data available for the task of search queries that can be used in conjunction with other data sources such as search trees @cite . our work differs in that we do not rely on the fact that we are interested in identifying entities in the same category , which is the focus of this paper .
- the first group of approaches for semantic entity retrieval is based on knowledge bases ( kbs ) @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose to use knowledge base ( kb ) for user queries and query queries to user queries , which are then used to extract user answer entities. in @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , bm25 @cite , and multi-instance ranking @cite are used to recommend entities based on user movement properties. however , these approaches are not applicable to the task of entity retrieval , which is different from our work .
- recently , there has been a revival of interest in the computer scientists and practitioners nowadays. for example , @cite propose to combine the adjacency matrix of a triple by calculating the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors in an embedding space. however , this method does not scale to large datasets. instead , we use the interlinked cnns as a feature vector , which may not be sufficiently expressive enough for large datasets , especially for small datasets , which are not applicable for large-scale datasets like imagenet . also , our method is based on @cite . in contrast to @cite , our interlinked datasets which are much less memory available .
- recently , several methods have been proposed for fine-grained part recognition @cite @cite @cite . gkioxari al @cite propose a method for fine-grained pose estimation , which is based on the vgg-16 network @cite . <unk> al @cite train a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to identify subtle regions of the object category , and combine it with the deformable part-based model ( dpm ) @cite . however , these methods are not robust to occlusion due to the lack of sufficient training data for object recognition. in contrast to these methods , our approach localizes objects based on object parts , which are not semantically related to our work .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they present an approach to collecting data from networked data , using the history of machine learning techniques to identify suspicious patterns of the data , such as linkedin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . the goal of our approach is to find an algorithm that assigns to each entry to the system , and then uses the edge of the product. however , in contrast , our approach does not require any taxonomic knowledge of the system and the system is not usable .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose a hierarchical approach for estimating the response of a data point in the presence of a product. in contrast to our work , @cite uses a similar approach to ours , but instead of using an online fitting procedure , we also use a similar technique to @cite @cite . however , their approach requires 2-3 training examples , which may be impractical for large training data sets , which are impractical for real-world applications. in contrast , our method does not require any solver to be retrained for each data point .

- knowledge distillation @cite @cite @cite is the first successful way to distill knowledge from a pre-trained network. it has shown that knowledge distillation can be used to compress a large network @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to train a network with a pre-trained network , which is not surprising in practical applications such as imagenet @cite . in this paper , we propose the use of the teacher network and consult the accuracy of the network in the ilsvrc @cite . our work differs from @cite in that we use the same network architecture as the backbone of the model and the student network .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for estimating the location of a robot ' s intention @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , a beacon is used to estimate the position of the robots in a given environment , and in @cite the authors propose an approach based on a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to discover the state dynamics of a system that can be used in a variety of contexts , such as autonomous vehicles @cite @cite , agent tracking @cite , and doppler fields @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any human intervention , which is a low-cost tool. in contrast to these approaches , our method does not rely on a general-purpose transceiver that allows beacons to have access to the system ' s ability .
- joint localization and localization for wireless robots has been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use a neural network to estimate a wireless robot ' s location based on the location of the robot , and then use a kalman filter to find the optimal map for the localization task. in @cite the authors present an approach for indoor settings where activating user beacons are inserted and gradients are computed using a kalman filter. in contrast , our approach is different from @cite @cite , where we use a joint detector and localization layer , which is more robust than @cite .

- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image generation @cite @cite , reconstruction @cite , face recognition @cite , image captioning @cite , and reconstruction @cite . in particular , lsgan al @cite proposed a model that learns to generate high resolution images using a generative adversarial network ( gan ) @cite , which learns a generative model that can be trained end-to-end using a minimax least square error minimization method ( <unk> ) @cite and a <unk> training method @cite that learns a clean image from the generator and generates clean images that are indistinguishable from real images .
- our work is also related to @cite , where the authors propose a hierarchy of type-i and <unk> images from fb face images. the bridge between these two methods is that the type-i face image from a <unk> face image can be translated to a stack of <unk> images and a <unk> face image , which can be used for <unk> <unk> <unk> face images @cite . in contrast to these methods , our method does not rely on <unk> images , which are more robust to the variations of the templates. in this paper , instead , we train a <unk> image from two <unk> images .
- in @cite , the authors propose a real-time mapping algorithm for rgb-d cameras using a camera. they use a kalman filter ( ekf ) and a particle filter ( <unk> ) to estimate the skelet al location and orientation of the rgb-d image using a kalman filter. however , this method does not scale well with the number of sensors available for the rgb-d camera. in contrast , our method is based on a semi-dense map , which is not robust to occlusion and illumination changes , and thus can be used in real-time applications where the camera motion is estimated from the camera. in this paper , we show that the use of semi-dense maps can be accelerated by using a monocular camera .
- in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical mapping ( kinectfusion ) for mesh tracking. in this approach , the point cloud is represented as a point cloud of the mesh , which consists of a set of points that correspond to the point of the image. in contrast to kinectfusion , our approach does not require geometric information , but instead relies on motion information and operates directly on the rgb image. in this paper , we propose a semi-dense mapping ( <unk> ) algorithm which is based on the icp algorithm proposed in @cite . in contrast , our method does not rely on the semi-dense map , which can be used in conjunction with optical flow estimation .
- in @cite , the authors propose a coarse-to-fine tracking algorithm based on a kalman filter ( <unk> ) to solve the rgb-d tracking problem using a kalman filter. in this paper , we propose an efficient method for estimating the camera pose using cpu and cpu constraints. however , we demonstrate that the performance of icp is significantly improved in terms of the number of threads , which is not the focus of this paper. in contrast to @cite , we proposed a method that fertile moving sensors in an efficient manner without the need to be addressed. in addition , our method does not rely on cpu and gpu implementation .
- graph slam methods can be divided into two categories : graph based methods ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) , graph photometric algorithms ( e.g. @cite , @cite ) and graph photometric methods ( see @cite for an excellent review ) . in contrast , our method does not require any geometric information , which can be directly applied to slam systems where geometric information is used to improve tracking quality. in contrast to our method , we propose a semi-dense method based on semi-dense methods , which iteratively improves tracking accuracy by reducing the number of threads and reducing the search space to 34 threads .
- in @cite , the authors propose a real-time mapping ( <unk> ) for rgb-d tracking , which is based on a kalman filter ( <unk> ) . in this approach , the input is assumed to be known , and the output of the rgb-d camera. in the first step , the reader is referred to @cite . in the second stage , the algorithm is trained to recover the full pose of the input image , and then the output is estimated from the output image , which can be estimated by using the mse of the error between the input and output image features. in this paper , we propose a direct method for mapping the output from the rgb-d image to the input image. in this way , we use the <unk> algorithm to perform mapping and photometric alignment .
- the visual tracking problem has been extensively studied in robotics and robotics @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a visual slam system based on a visual bundle adjustment ( <unk> ) algorithm. the visual slam problem is formulated as a 3d slam problem , where the goal is to minimize the photometric error subject to constraints on the angle between the camera. the optimization problem is then solved using a kalman filter ( ekf ) algorithm @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on kalman filtering ( <unk> ) , which is based on dp ( dp ) @cite .
- graph super-resolution ( sfm ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular approach to estimate the relative pose between users and 6d poses using icp. these methods are based on the assumption that the object appearances are known. however , they are not robust to occlusions , due to the lack of sufficient computational resources and memory requirement for large scale environments , which limits the generalization ability to real-world environments @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we propose a visual slam algorithm based on <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite , we are not aware of the work of <unk> al @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method to estimate the distribution of the camera time using a camera. the method is based on the assumption that the camera is known to lie in the range of views. in this paper , we use a pose-graph estimation of semi-dense errors , which is not robust to illumination changes , and thus can be used in conjunction with a photometric error minimization. however , this method is not applicable to rgb-d slam systems since it is not scalable to rgb-d sensors , especially for outdoor environments. hence , our method does not require any segmentation of the environment .
- in @cite , a surfel-based map is used to estimate the surface robustness of the <unk> however , this approach requires a large amount of training data. in contrast to ham ' s <unk> approach , we propose an incremental fusion algorithm based on a surfel-based model of the map , which enables the reader to recover the full pose estimate. specifically , we use the <unk> approach , which divides the rgb-d sensors into 34 threads , and ingredients <unk> in the tum online simultaneous mapping ( online ) @cite , which has a significant limitation in terms of robustness and accuracy , which limits the applicability of our approach .
- directly estimating the depth of a rgb-d image is a challenging task due to photometric error minimization @cite @cite @cite . for example , integrates the direct estimation of the semi-dense map @cite @cite , minimizing the photometric error @cite , 3d illumination @cite , or semi-direct regression @cite @cite . the direct direct localization of a sparse visual depth map was proposed in @cite , where the direct matching is applied to the direct depth channel estimation problem using semi-direct methods ( dso ) @cite . the direct localization estimation of semi-dense maps has also been applied to monocular slam @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of geometric information , which may lead to sub-optimal solutions .
- the idea of using backpropagation for optimization of neural networks has also been explored in the context of generative models @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) that is trained to predict stability of a given generator and optimization function. in @cite the authors present a method that can be used for optimization problems , and in particular , in which generators are used to solve optimization problems in robotic vision. in contrast , our method is based on backpropagation , which allows for optimization , in contrast to our method , in the <unk> layer , the <unk> solver does not require optimization .

- in @cite , the authors propose to use truncated singular value decomposition ( svd ) to solve the problem of fitting neural networks to neural networks. in this paper , we propose a trainable backpropagation solver for the kws and vad tasks. however , we use the same idea as <unk> in @cite for the sake of completeness check the correctness of fully-connected layers , which is not the focus of this paper. in contrast , our method is more general and accepts valid parameters , which are amenable to data-parallel computation than <unk> however , our approach is different in that it relies on batch normalization ( <unk> ) , which we use in our experiments .

- in @cite , the authors propose a openacc boltzmann machine ( <unk> ) , which is based on openmp and openacc ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we focus on <unk> and <unk> accelerators , as well as openacc , we are aware of any work that aims at improving code performance and performance efficiency. in this paper , we propose a <unk> benchmark for <unk> code accelerators. we are interested in <unk> and <unk> , which are not concerned with the <unk> of the code , but we are not aware of the work that is most related to ours , as it is the focus of this paper .

- the control-flow randomization ( <unk> ) @cite is a widely used attack in remote overflow security. it has been shown that randomization can be used to improve the security of randomization. however , it does not guarantee that randomization is used to exploit the randomization of individual vulnerabilities in the systems , and thus , it is not clear how to tailor countermeasures to countermeasures , especially in randomization. additionally , there is also a trade-off between randomization and randomization in security prevention , but it is also worth mentioning that countermeasures are also worth <unk> , in contrast , our attack is based on randomization , randomization , which leads to countermeasures on countermeasures and security issues. in addition , we propose a method for randomizing randomization and maintaining randomization .
- in @cite , the authors propose a probabilistic approach to defending against attacks based on <unk> they propose an approach that compensates for the program ' s performance of security attacks. in this paper , we propose a method to mitigate the impact of the security of security in remote memory management. in contrast , we focus on attacks that are inexpensive and easy to implement , countermeasures , and spurious transformations are used to identify the replicas of failures and failures , in order to avoid illegal non-determinism , which is the focus of this paper is also related to our work , as it shows that it is possible to inject non-determinism , as well as other approaches .
- in @cite , the authors propose a probabilistic approach for representing vulnerabilities of an open-source software system called <unk> they propose an implementation of the security implementation of a random programming language model for attackers. however , their analysis is limited to the number of vulnerabilities , which makes it hard to scale up to large , large scale datasets , and large amounts of data. in contrast , our work is more general than @cite , but we do not provide a thorough analysis of countermeasures against countermeasures , as well as related work on security issues. in addition , we propose a novel probabilistic approach to quantify the impact of vulnerabilities on security of security games .

- in @cite , the authors propose a probabilistic approach based on gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , which compensates for the number of possible outcomes of runtime. in this paper , we propose a method based on random forests. instead , we also propose a novel approach to discover vulnerabilities in programs that can be used for attackers. however , we do not investigate the impact of countermeasures on the security of free caches , which is the focus of our work , is different from @cite , which focuses on the composition of free variables that are shared across different notions of vulnerabilities , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- the proposed method is also related to the hardware-friendly offset learning ( <unk> ) @cite , which uses a 2-d floor wall ( <unk> ) to obtain a compact representation of a graph , and then uses a dual offset to the dual offset of the offset function. the propagation of gradients in a square region can be used to compute a count of weights in a compact vector space , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . in contrast to our method , we do not require any preprocessing , which is a more efficient and efficient implementation of the <unk> decoding algorithm .
- the idea of using a set of weights in a graph was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in the context of belief propagation , @cite proposed a method for path offset propagation , which is based on the idea that a graph is assigned to all its neighbors. this method is similar to tomlab and <unk> @cite , where the weights of weights are updated iteratively , and the update is updated at each iteration of the graph until convergence. in this paper , we extend this idea to a more general class of problems , and show how to improve the performance of weights .

- our work is also related to the field of research in nowadays @cite , where the goal is to identify a set of patterns that are related to each other , such as , political , or social networks , to name a few. we refer the reader to @cite for an excellent review of related work in this area. however , our work focuses on method that is most related to ours , in that it is not specifically designed to complex valued networks , but instead relies on the availability of large amounts of data to adapt to real-world applications , as well as in the context of research .
- in the field of criminal incidents , individuals are often assumed to be assigned to each other @cite . in this context , the network is tasked with the problem of finding a set of features that are most likely to be similar to the one used in the literature. in this paper , we propose a methodology for detecting criminal incidents in urban communities , which is similar to our work , in that it is assumed that there is no evidence about the detection of criminal behavior , regardless of whether it is possible to find out that this is not the case where it is not possible to identify and annotate all possible in the network .
- our work is also related to the field of criminal activity detection @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that looks at the spread of proper data in urban criminal networks. in particular , our work focuses on the analysis of criminal behavior in urban communities , where the goal is to understand and understand criminal behavior through social networks. in contrast to our work , we propose an approach that identifies and analyze data from social networks , which allows us to analyze data identification in urban areas , specifically , and , in the context of urban criminal behavior , and study how to analyze and understand and analyze how it relates to platforms .
- in this paper , we exemplify our approach using deep learning techniques from criminal networks @cite . in contrast to our work , our approach is based on fluid mechanics , which is a key component of our study , aims at detecting burglary in particular , in the context of medical case identification , our work differs from these approaches in that we aim to detect <unk> probability of a particular piece of data that is used to predict the location of an activity in an residential thousands of nodes , while in our case we are interested in the number of nodes that are likely to occur in a proper way .

- metric learning ( <unk> ) @cite is a classical metric learning algorithm for metric learning , where the goal is to minimize the difference between the input data and the target data. in contrast to the above methods , the distance between the source and target examples is minimized by minimizing the mse of the target loss function. however , in practice , it is not clear how this method can be applied to metric learning problems , such as image classification @cite . in this paper , we propose a method that is based on a distance metric that is used to compute distance between examples in a euclidean space .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use semidefinite programming ( sdp ) to solve the problem of metric learning for a large number of data points in the time domain. in the first step , the algorithm starts by solving the following optimization problem : where @math and @math are the number of samples and @math , where @math is the maximum number of terms @math . in the second step , @math is a regularization parameter that penalizes @math for @math . in contrast to the above mentioned methods , the method in @cite is based on the idea of solving an optimization problem , which aims at finding an optimal solution for a given objective function .

- metric learning ( mtl ) has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , metric learning @cite , and metric learning in computer vision @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn a distance metric for each data point in a euclidean space. in contrast , our method can be viewed as a sparse metric learning problem , where the goal is to minimize the distance between the input and output points. in contrast to the above methods , our distance metric is more principled and more principled than unsupervised metric learning methods .
- 3d face recognition has been a popular topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a method for 3d face reconstruction using deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite . in @cite , a morphable model is used for 3d shape reconstruction , followed by uncalibrated laplace transform ( <unk> ) @cite . in @cite a cnn is trained for 3d reconstruction of frontal face images and then a meta photo was used for facial alignment in @cite . in contrast , our method is more general than that of @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we are interested in surpass face reconstruction from a single image .
- 3d face reconstruction has been a popular research topic in computer vision. it has been widely used in face recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a 3d morphable model ( 3dmm ) for face recognition. recently , fergus al @cite introduced a 3d cad model to estimate the parameters of a 3d face model using a virtual transformer network ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast to these methods , our method is based on a cnn trained on imagenet @cite , which has markedly different variations in pose , illumination , illumination and lighting. in contrast , the scanning pattern of 2d faces in the scanning process of medical imaging has a large number of real-world applications .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using deep neural networks for accurate face recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a data augmentation approach for training face matching images using a domain transfer network ( painting , strokes ) and trained a cnn for matching performances with a wide range of viewing conditions ( see , e.g. , levoy @cite for an early paper @cite for a thorough review ) . <unk> al @cite developed an approach for regressing faces from a single image to a single 3dmm based on a stack of convolutional layers followed by a fully-connected crf on top of the input image .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , which uses a single image shape-from-shading ( sfs ) @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of training data for training , which is impractical for real-world applications. in contrast to our method , our method is more general and applicable than @cite , where the results of @cite are based on a single 3dmm based self-training ( <unk> ) @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work on surpass 3d shapes using stereo. instead of estimating keypoints from input images , our approach uses a similar approach to @cite .
- face recognition has been an active research topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a method for face recognition using a nine-layer deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) trained on imagenet @cite . in @cite the authors presented an shortage of training data for the task of recognising known objects in the wild ( <unk> ) , which consists of five convolutional layers trained on imagenet. in contrast to these approaches , our symptom alignment method is based on alignment of face images , which is different from our approach. in contrast , our method aims at generating 3d faces from discriminative face images with only a handful of hand-engineered features .
- zero-shot learning ( zsl ) @cite aims to learn a model that can generalize to sets of web images in a variety of ways. for example , torralba @cite proposed a soft scene ranking framework for visual question-answering ( <unk> ) that jointly learns visual and visual subcategories of relations and relations in a markov chain graph ( hmm ) . recently , several approaches have been proposed to learn scene ranking from web images @cite @cite @cite . recently , the use of deep neural networks for visual ranking has been demonstrated @cite @cite . in contrast to these approaches , our work builds on top of scene graphs , which is a more general and challenging task than robotic manipulation .
- graph neural networks have also been used for visual classification @cite @cite , gnn @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . our work differs from these approaches in that we do not require any graph neural network neural networks , and we are not aware of any prior work that applies rnns to graphs with graphs that have immensely expressive power on graphs and datasets. our work is also related to @cite , which also uses a recursive neural networks ( gnns ) @cite .
- our work is also closely related to counting algorithms for graphs @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a latent representation of graphs that can be used to describe the structure of a graph @cite @cite . the main difference of our approach is that we use the graph kernels instead of individual paths , and use them as a means to represent a variety of graphs , such as graphs , graphs , and graphs with arbitrary size @math . in contrast , our graph kernels are based on the concept of kernel kernels ( see section ) . in contrast to counting , our method is more general and less applicable than counting algorithms .
- recently , unsupervised style transfer methods have also been proposed for image style transfer @cite @cite @cite , which can be used to train a deep neural network for style transfer , @cite , @cite and @cite . however , these methods require careful initialization of source and target style , which limits the generalization ability of the network to be trained in an end-to-end manner , which is hard to collect. in contrast , we propose a feedforward network that learns color transfer based on the hidden activations of the source and source images , while our work is different in that we show that our method is more robust to misalignment .
- in the last few years , there has been a lot of work on artistic style transfer @cite @cite @cite . for example , gatys et. al @cite proposed to train a feed-forward neural network for image style transfer , where the goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the content and style of the input image and style images of the same image. in @cite , <unk> al proposed a feed-forward network for style transfer by training feed-forward neural networks on convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . in @cite the authors proposed an instance normalization layer that approximates the content of an image using the batch normalization layer , which is similar to our approach .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors train a network to predict the artistic style of an image given its image , given the image of the image , the style of the video , given that the image is rendered from the image to the image ' s image , and then use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) trained on the image style image to generate the image that satisfies the given image. however , this approach does not scale well to large images with large amounts of training data , and thus can be used to train an image that can be rendered .
- in @cite , the authors propose a single convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for artistic style transfer , which is composed of several stacked layers that are shared across different layers. in contrast to @cite , our style transfer method is different from @cite , in that it is trained on imagenet classification and achieves state-of-the-art performance on artistic style matching tasks. however , our method does not rely on a pre-trained network , and instead relies on an optimization procedure that alternates between updating an intermediate representation of the input image and the output of the network in a limited way , and thus can be used in a more efficient manner .

- the optimal caching probability for heterogeneous cellular networks is studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a novel linear capacity scaling model for the base cellular network. in @cite the authors show that the base caching node is cached with a small number of bss in a hetnet , and show that caching with purely linear backhaul improves the bitrate scaling ratio of the base network. in the above works , we propose a probabilistic single-tier single-tier single-tier network architecture for the dense caching problem , which is different from the conventional sdp based caching method. in the first step , we establish the optimal scaling ratio between the base cache size and the backhaul cache size .
- our work is also related to work on authorship attribution @cite @cite . however , we focus on security issues that are related to our work , which is different from that of @cite . we believe that security is a key component of indistinguishability plagiarism detection in source code , as well as the possibility of misleading and correct attacks , which may be problematic when the attacker is unaware of the attacker ' s ability to access to the source code ( i.e. , source code records ) . in contrast , our work focuses on inferring which features are shared across source code and source code .
- source code coding ( programs ) @cite @cite @cite is a powerful tool for defining programs using homomorphic encryption to compare the performance of source code. however , it is not clear how re-encryption is performed on unencrypted and encrypted data , which is not the case of malware obfuscation @cite @cite . moreover , in @cite , the results of @cite indicate that source code fragments are very close to each other , while in @cite the effect of security on malware obfuscation is limited to displaying malware obfuscation instructions on unencrypted circuits , thereby making them difficult for malware users. in contrast , our work focuses on generating programs using ordinary differential encryption ( cryptosystem ) .
- in @cite , it is shown that indistinguishability in indistinguishability for indistinguishability indistinguishability using functional obfuscation @cite @cite @cite . however , this work does not consider the @math -differential obfuscation , which does not rely on the fact that the attacker knows the access to the source code , which is not adjustable to the private code obfuscation proposed in @cite @cite . however , it has not been shown in @cite that it is possible to securely modify the union of private source code obfuscation techniques @cite @cite . our work differs from these works in that we use the union selector to minimise the difference between encrypted and encrypted data .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use source code to publish programs using wires and misleading source code fragments of source code , as well as misleading results for the target circuit. however , their work is different from ours in that it does not require any extra knowledge of the circuit , which is a key contribution to our work , as it is not aware of any work on security obfuscation techniques , such as @cite . however , it is still not clear how to secure source circuits , as we do in this paper , since we are interested in performance of indistinguishability source code mining .
- coding results have been shown to be useful for improving security efficiency in remote data repositories @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to modify the circuit structure of the circuit , which may not be optimal. to overcome this problem , @cite propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme based on homomorphic encryption ( <unk> ) , which enables the use of homomorphic encryption to preserve correlations among the second-order proximity. however , the scheme requires homomorphic operations to store the entire code , which is not applicable to our setting. moreover , in contrast , our method does not rely on any kind of data .
- recently , spatial transformer networks ( stn ) @cite @cite have shown impressive results in semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our method can be trained end-to-end for semantic segmentation , where the network is trained to predict a clean image from the input image , and thus the network can be used to predict the target image from its input image. however , in our case , we are interested in the segmentation of aerial images , which is not the case for our instructional images , as we demonstrate in section . we show that our approach is significantly more robust than @cite .
- deep neural networks have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , image matching @cite , and geolocalization segmentation @cite @cite . recently , deep learning has also been applied to image matching , geolocalization , as well as computer vision @cite @cite . for a comprehensive review of image matching and geolocalization , see , e.g. , @cite @cite . we refer the reader to recent surveys @cite @cite for an overview of recent work on cross-view image matching . we refer to @cite for a survey on image matching . in contrast to these works , we use aerial images to predict ground truth ground truth from noisy imagery .
- in the last few years , unsupervised methods have been proposed to address the problem of semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for the task of road segmentation. in @cite the authors use a deep network trained on the imagenet classification dataset @cite , which consists of a cnn trained on imagenet classification imagenet classification task , and a cnn pre-trained on the aerial image dataset @cite . in contrast , our system is trained using a large number of images extracted from the imagenet large flickr aerial image , and the <unk> 100k image dataset , which contains 100k images from imagenet. in contrast to @cite , we propose a novel method that recovers the clean image from the ground truth image and a clean image. we show that pre-training on a large dataset is sufficient for road sensing .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use a mixture of experts ( alm ) for semantic segmentation and semantic segmentation , while @cite uses a similar approach to ours , but their approach is different from ours in that it learns the transformation between source and target domains. in contrast to @cite , we do not assume that source and ground truth labels are available at training time. in contrast , our adaptive segmentation network learns segmentation features from aerial images , while the goal of aligning the source and predicted samples from target samples .
- in @cite , the authors propose a user feedback system based on the structure of the architecture of the system for repairing notifications as well as the user repairing policies incurring significant information overload over the entire system , and propose an automatic repeat request detection system for detecting moments of the user and frustration. this is done by computing the average number of user plans in order to reduce the search space of notifications and gpus. however , it is not clear how to tailor alerts notifications on top of two notifications : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are likely to be <unk> to overcome this limitation , we propose an approach based on <unk> and <unk> .
- affect learning has been extensively studied in the last few years. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a new connected phone network ( <unk> ) to predict the relevance of a user ' s messages based on the average message length of the messages sent by the manager ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors present a feedback mechanism to user updates from a connected phone to a dcnn. the work of @cite , @cite , and @cite , have shown that users prefer to change their responsiveness to users when they are connected to the day. however , in practice , notifications and <unk> show that the system is able to user <unk> notifications and tweets , which are more likely to resonate with different modalities , such as imagenet @cite , imagenet @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> .
- prior work has focused on making use of prior knowledge of notifications on notifications @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these studies focus on intention and are not concerned with intention to understand notifications and tweets @cite @cite . in contrast to these studies , we study how participants emerge in a longer time , rather than individual notifications , and show how to use machine learning techniques to identify notifications and quickly became popular. on the other hand , our study focuses on checking usage patterns for notifications as well as notifications as <unk> campaigns for notifications and things , while the work in @cite presents a comprehensive survey on usage usage of notifications and notifications .

- there has been a large body of work on application usage of clinically connected system knowledge bases ( kbs ) @cite @cite @cite . however , these studies focus on specific types of knowledge , which is the focus of our work on usage of data analytics over longer periods of time , as well as for notifications and <unk> notifications @cite @cite . on the other hand , there are several studies that investigate management models for notifications as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .

- volunteers and practitioners have been alleged to influence the value of notifications @cite . however , most of these notifications are <unk> , which are more likely to be <unk> compared to users ' locked and <unk> , two participants were <unk> : <unk> , personality , and security. the first group of <unk> notifications and <unk> @cite examined users ' impact on the impact of quest for notifications on notifications and tweets in less less less than <unk> , and compared the <unk> turing machine https : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors propose a clinically connected phone call graph ( volunteers ) to simply minimize the number of recruited alerts in the population. they report interruptions on phone call records ( <unk> ) and hubs ( <unk> ) , with sight. the drawback of this method is the lack of feedback , which is the fact that participants can access to. this is due to interruptions that occur in phone networks , where there are only two types : ( i ) interruptions that are <unk> ; ( ii ) interruptions are caused by lighting , and ( v ) interruptions in the day. in this way , participants need to flag all possible plans , which may lead to interruptions in false detections that occur during interruptions to push or push <unk> ; ( vi ) attack the phones to attack the same. in this paper , two <unk> methods have been proposed to detect participants ' plans .
- recently , cnns have achieved state-of-the-art results in action recognition @cite @cite @cite , but they are not applicable to our task , as we are aware of any work that explicitly models the appearance of terrain surfaces and object attributes , such as context , occlusion , occlusion and occlusion , and viewpoint. our work is inspired by the recent advances in deep learning for action recognition in computer vision , which has shown to be very effective for action segmentation @cite . in contrast , we propose a new image-based computational architecture that can be used to learn features for action recognition. in addition , we use a fully convolutional neural network ( cnn ) trained on object detection and terrain recognition .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in person re-identification @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a set of connected fields ( bovw ) framework to capture appearance and spatial relationships between frames , while in @cite the authors utilize the motion information of the egocentric camera , which is assumed to be synchronized with the visual information from the personal sensors. in addition , the work in @cite presents an approach for capturing both appearance and motion information across video streams , in which appearance features are learned from kinesthetic demonstrations , and then follow the same approach as @cite .
- recently , several methods have been proposed to solve the problem of human destination tracking , such as @cite @cite @cite . these methods are based on the assumption that the location of the object is known , e.g. , @cite , @cite . however , they do not consider collision detection , which is the focus of our work , is on estimating the appearance of each object in non-overlapping scenes , while our method is most similar to @cite @cite . however , in contrast , our problem is different from theirs in two aspects. first , we assume that people have access to each other , and then use these detections to estimate the appearance and destination .

( v ) we propose a preliminary study on complementary data in recommender networks @cite @cite . ( c ) we use complementary information to the complementary information of recommender system , ( 2 ) .
- cer is also related to aspect extraction problem @cite @cite @cite . recently , there has been a lot of attention in recent years. for example , in @cite proposed a sentence classification problem based on word similarity. in @cite , proposed a method to recognize reviews in reviews based on the context of sentiment classification. in @cite propose a decision tree problem based method based on sentiment analysis ( csm ) , which consists of several hand-crafted features including hog , hof , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .

- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of registry matches in a corpus. for example , cache-conscious trees are used to extract features from the article @cite . the authors report that features extracted from a single title can be used for registry matches , in order to detect inconsistent locations in a set of queries. in contrast to these approaches , our approach is more general and more general than the ones used in this paper , but we propose a three-step approach : ( i ) pruning , and ( ii ) pruning ; and ( iii ) post-processing ; ( v ) post-processing techniques for topic extraction , which are based on heuristics such as due to the large number of features extracted in a kb .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose a method for registry articles based on registry words. the work in this paper is different from ours in two aspects. first , instead of using features extracted from the latent indexing corpus , our approach is different : ( i ) it constructs a score function @math for each title @math , and ( ii ) pmi @math for a triple @math , while ( iii ) the score function of @math for odd values @math is the number of extracted features in the da dataset ; ( v ) pmi is used to identify the most likely matches for a given dataset .
- da costa , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have shown to be a useful tool for comparison of da and registry articles. the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where they propose a method for registry articles using a <unk> figure ( b ) . the goal is to match the features extracted from the detected features ( c ) , and ( d ) ) ) . in contrast , our approach is different in that we propose a pre-defined corpus of registry articles , which is a pre-defined set of keywords. furthermore , in contrast to our approach , the focus in this paper is on da rather rather than a single label .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a distance metric for registry documents. the score is defined as the difference between the features extracted from the detected features ( e.g. , registry ) . in contrast to our approach , we do not consider the cold start problem , but instead consider the problem of registry matches in the heterogeneous setting. in contrast , our approach is more general and applicable to datasets , as we do in this paper , but we propose a new distance metric based method based on distance measures , which is based on the idea proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which has a much larger number of features extracted by a corpus .
- similarity measures , such as snippets , snippets , and registry @cite , have shown to be useful for registry articles , but also to the best of our knowledge , da is the first to propose a similarity function based on snippets of features extracted from the detected features of a document , and the second one generalises to registry matches , in conjunction with a similarity measure. note that snippets on the other hand , snippets are likely to be played in the heterogeneous datasets , which is the focus of this paper , as well as the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper we propose a special case of snippets that are extracted from two different datasets .
- h.3.7 and <unk> @cite propose a set of rule-based features for registry articles , which are extracted from the non-conforming factor ( <unk> ) . the key difference between our approach and these approaches lies in the fact that we are interested in the cold start problem ( <unk> ) , which is the focus of this paper , is related to our work , but differs from our work in two aspects. first , we propose a method based on the integration of features extracted from different research groups , and we propose immunization factor and the features extracted at different levels of metadata and citations .
- h.3.7 and <unk> @cite propose a set of rule-based features for registry articles , which are extracted from the non-conforming factor ( <unk> ) . the key difference between our approach and these approaches lies in the fact that we are interested in the cold start problem ( <unk> ) , which is the focus of this paper , is related to our work , but differs from our work in two aspects. first , we propose a method based on the integration of features extracted from different research groups , and we propose immunization factor and the features extracted at different levels of metadata and citations .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for da classification , including support vector machine ( svm ) @cite , support vector machines ( svms ) @cite @cite @cite , decision trees ( <unk> ) @cite and header fields ( cc ) @cite . the most relevant work to ours is @cite , where the authors propose an approach for extracting features from the features extracted from the title and registry articles , and then use them to detect matches in a line. in contrast , our approach is based on the metadata provided in the kb , which is found to be very useful for da extraction. in contrast to @cite , our method is more general and applicable to datasets with inconsistent labels .
- da costa and <unk> @cite propose a set of integration techniques for registry articles in a document. their work differs from ours in two aspects. first , we focus on features extracted from different sources of information , rather than match them in the heterogeneous setting. second , our approach differs in several aspects : ( i ) we aim to detect keyphrases ; ( ii ) we are not aware of any work that is most related to da , and ( v ) our method is based on da and ( iii ) it is not clear how integration can be performed in a heterogeneous environment .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a method for registry matches in a corpus. their method is based on registry keys. in contrast to our approach , the features extracted from the registry are irrelevant to the detected features , while our approach is more general and applicable to heterogeneous datasets , as well as the cold start problem ( see section ) . in contrast , our approach does not require any metadata , which is more scalable than the original da search problem , and thus it is easy to scale to large datasets with large number of articles , such as freebase @cite . in addition , it is not clear how to tailor a method to other datasets .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work on estimating the cardinality of a stream in estimating the number of lossy points in a stream @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a federated query task , where the elements of the elements in the stream are sampled from the stream , while in @cite the authors consider the problem of sample passing through a stream of measurements. in the case of lossy group identification , the problem is solvable in @math time @cite , where @math and @math are the elements associated weights of the stream .
- there is a large body of work on computing well-founded quantities , including @cite , @cite , and @cite . the main difference between our approach and these approaches is that we compute the size of the elements of size @math and @math , where @math is the number of elements in the stream @math . in contrast , our approach is more general than the proportion of elements of elements @math . in contrast to these methods , we use a more principled treatment of the plurality hash functions @math . in addition , in the spirit of the work of <unk> and ben-david @cite , we define a set of types of types and evaluate it in a more general setting .
- in the sliding window approach , the goal is to find a sample @math that minimizes the @math th entry of the elements of @math and @math , where @math is the number of elements in @math . for example , in @cite , it is assumed that @math , @math , and @math . for @math , if @math , then @math is a set of @math points in @math . in practice , @math is usually a small number of points in the @math class. if @math is small , then it can be seen as a generalization of @math for @math . in the same vein , @cite proposed a method for @math -way synopsis query estimation , which has been shown to be very useful for solving @math -way cardinality query query query problems .
- our work is also closely related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the goal is to estimate a distribution of the elements of @math and @math , where @math is the size of the distribution of @math , and @math are the number of elements in @math . the lower bound of @math was later improved to @math by <unk> @cite , who showed that for @math , there exists a polynomial-time @math -approximation algorithm for @math @cite , and for a @math -way @math -way sample @cite . our lower bound is substantially different than that of @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general than the @math -net definition , but we prove that it is not sufficient for @math .
- software quality services such as iso <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite conservatively extend the expressive power of software systems by defining the containment expressed in terms of the quality of the software quality measure. while these systems are capable of software quality assurance , they do not provide any means for software quality. furthermore , we are interested in software quality reporting , which is the focus of our research on software quality evaluation and quality evaluation in managing software quality. in contrast to the present work , we focus on software satisfaction problem ( <unk> ) , which we present in this paper .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , where the authors train a neural network to train a sigmoid belief network ( <unk> ) . in contrast to our work , our work is also related to @cite , which is closest to ours in the sense that it is more general than @cite . however , their inference procedure does not require any training of the belief network , and we do not use any sort of supervision to train the belief net estimator for discrete distribution. in contrast , our method does not rely on any taxonomic syntax of the output network .
- our work is also related to recent work on entity linking @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on the task of entity linking in the ner task , which is most related to our work , our method is also inspired by the work of @cite , which also aims at aligning words in the sentence and ner task jointly with the entity embeddings learned from the source language and the target word embedding. in contrast to these methods , our ner task is more general and can be seen as a more challenging task than ner in ner task and ner , where the goal is to learn entity embeddings for ner task .
- bibliometric churn studies have been widely studied in the last few years. for example , researchers have begun to investigate the impact of bibliometric topics in publication studies @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors present a study of pss and dblp : journals corr <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> . in this study , we focus on the evolution of scientific paper and investigate community acceptance conference related work .
- in @cite , the authors propose a formalization of dcf based on dcf , which is based on fluid approximations of the backoff equation. in particular , it has been shown that power-line model coincides with a data-rate theorem @cite @cite @cite . however , the analysis of a mac protocol for ieee plc has not been investigated in the context of ieee plc , see , e.g. , @cite @cite and references therein. moreover , the performance analysis of dcf depends heavily on the quality of the protocol , which makes it possible to derive a solution for a large number of terminals ( see section ) .
- in @cite , the authors propose a markov chain monte carlo ( 802.11e edca ) based on the assumption that an access point is reached , given that the back-off period is reached ( see section ) . in this paper , the focus of this paper is on the data-rate theorems ( theorems ) and ) . in contrast to our work , our model is more general than that of @cite , in which the medium is assumed to be constant , i.e. , @math , where @math is the number of access points and @math is a constant function of @math , which can be used for our analysis .
- there has been a lot of work on model performance for csma ca @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a model for rts games that can be used to model traffic congestion. in @cite the authors present an analytical model for the performance of dcf based on fluid mechanics , which is based on cts and <unk> they show that communication can be performed in polynomial time using quasi experiments. in @cite @cite , a model of <unk> for ieee plc , called cts ( <unk> ) is proposed , which allows for fault-tolerance in ieee 802.11 networks @cite . in this paper , we consider a more general model than a single model , in which a model is conceived as a mac protocol ( <unk> ) .
- our work is also related to the field of network model model model compression. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a fixed-point model , which is based on the data-rate theorem @cite @cite . in @cite the authors present a protocol for ieee ieee plc , which consists of five phases : ( 1 ) ph <unk> , ( 2 ) <unk> , ( 3 ) ph <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and ( 4 ) <unk> model checker @cite , ( v ) <unk> model checker ( plc ) @cite @cite , and in @cite . in this paper , we consider a more general model than @cite @cite .
- the problem of finding the optimal transport problem has also been studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a @math -competitive algorithm for the underlying problem , where @math and @math are the number of vehicles and @math is the maximum number of vertices in the graph. in @cite the authors present a algorithm to compute the shortest path for each vehicle in the underlying graph , where each vehicle is assumed to be a poisson point process ( see also @cite ) . the algorithm is also used in @cite to find the optimal solution of the problem for the vehicle capacity problem .
- the problem of scheduling in dial-a-ride problems has been studied in the context of vehicle scheduling @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a capacitated transportation problem for @math vehicles , where @math and @math are the root of the depot , and @math . the problem is also related to the problem considered in this paper. in @cite the authors present an algorithm that finds a plan from @math to @math if @math is @math . the goal is to find the @math from @math , where the root is @math . if @math , then it is not known that @math is not necessary. in this paper , we assume that the vehicle is known .
- transfer learning ( mtl ) @cite @cite @cite aims to learn representations that are invariant to transformations that can be shared across different modalities @cite @cite . transfer learning seeks to learn discriminative representations that disentangle different modalities of different modalities , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite @cite , and sound @cite @cite . in contrast , our method can be viewed as a generalisation of the knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain. in addition , we are interested in using unlabeled data for video segmentation , in which the goal of maximizing the depth of the target video is to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target modalities .
- recently , cnns have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , knowledge bases @cite , and knowledge distillation @cite . in particular , cnn has shown to be very powerful. it has shown that cnn has a large success of deep convolutional networks ( cnns ) to learn to predict the image pixel labels. in this paper , we propose a novel layer modifying layer called units ( prelu ) . in contrast , our method is different from these methods in that it does not require any layer of cnn , and hence it is not clear how this method can be applied to units .
- a variety of approaches have been proposed to assess security of human access to public transportation. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use machine learning techniques to identify traffic patterns in urban environments. in @cite the authors present a method to extract data from street view flows using the italian parliament. @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> propose a method for analyzing human social networks based on the italian @cite . in @cite a survey on the topic of human mobility is presented , in which the authors use analytical data to identify and understand the characteristics of human social connections .
- there has been a lot of work on the side-channel routes. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite examined the effect of the variances on the number of reception of street points on the screen , the <unk> game @cite , the <unk> game @cite and the <unk> game @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on the population count , which is closest to our work , also known as <unk> models @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our prior work , we use <unk> regressions for the purpose of genre tracking in location-based social media , where people invite people to move freely respond to people .
- transfer learning ( transfer learning ) @cite aims to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain by transferring knowledge from source domain data to the target domain , and transfer learning across domains to transfer the source task to target domain to target domains , while transfer learning aims to minimize the discrepancy between source and target domains by minimizing the mutual discrepancy between the source domain and target distributions. transfer learning seeks to minimize domain discrepancy ( mmd ) between domains , and minimize mmd loss ( ssim ) . mmd measures that minimize mmd measure discrepancy between domains are commonly used in transfer learning .
- word embeddings have been used for sentiment classification @cite @cite @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , and sentiment lexicon @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on hand-crafted features , such as hog @cite , hof @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . our work differs from these methods in that we use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to learn word embeddings for each word in a sentence. our task is different from these approaches as we do not require a large number of labeled training examples .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose to use a cnn to predict the next word in the context of a sentence. however , their approach is different from ours in that we use a pre-trained cnn model for the task of sentiment analysis , while our approach is more general and applicable to the semeval 2007 dataset , which is the largest and largest number of sentence-level embeddings for sentiment analysis and sentiment analysis . our work differs from the previous work in that it is focused on word embeddings rather than the word embeddings themselves .
- attention models have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as machine translation @cite @cite @cite , image captioning @cite , and machine translation analysis @cite @cite . attention mechanisms have also been applied to machine translation tasks @cite @cite . for example , an attention mechanism was proposed in @cite to learn visual embeddings for questions and answers. in @cite , a global attention model based on an attention layer was proposed , and a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) was proposed to extract features from visual features , eg. tags , n-grams , n-grams and n-grams features , and word embeddings @cite .
- in this paper , we focus on reducing the number of redundant data in the learning process. in particular , we are interested in reducing the accuracy of the learning algorithm in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use existential measures in order to reduce the perturbation of the data , while in @cite the authors show that frequent itemsets are sufficient to find frequent itemsets in a substring of the same class can be used to improve the productivity of the classifiers in @cite . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the fragmentation method for distributed data mining is reviewed in @cite . in the following section , we review related work related to our work. the first work is based on the theory of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . the main difference is that ( i ) pruning decision trees ( ii ) decision trees based methods ( iii ) pruning algorithms ( v ) pruning techniques are based on longest common ( un ) balanced trees ( v , v ) <unk> ( fm ) <unk> ( vi ) <unk> decision trees ) , which is a key component in the security community detection implementation ( <unk> ) .

- in @cite , the authors propose a scalable video coding ( bsc ) for video streaming using a large number of antennas at video frames , while in @cite the authors consider the problem of video streaming video streaming , and assume that users have access to the camera. in @cite users are assumed to be available at the first weeks of the video buffers , which is assumed to lie in the third dimension of the video. in @cite a similar approach is proposed in @cite for the case of <unk> video streaming services , where users are unaware of the quality of service ( qos ) .

- differential search ( dp ) @cite is a popular policy search method. it has been successfully applied to imitation learning @cite @cite @cite . policy search ( gps ) @cite uses a policy gradient method to learn a policy from demonstration @cite @cite . however , it does not require any prior knowledge of the environment , which may be unavailable in real-world applications where the environment is unavailable and unreliable , especially when the training environment is too large to generalize to unseen environments @cite @cite . in contrast , our policy based policy gradient ( hjb ) is a differentiable function approximator , which enables us to learn visuomotor behaviors .
- deep reinforcement learning ( rl ) has been successfully applied to robotic tasks such as visual control @cite @cite @cite , visual question answering @cite , manipulation @cite , and autonomous driving. however , the current state of the art is still due to the fact that the learned policy can be learned directly from raw sensory data @cite @cite . in practice , deep q-learning ( <unk> ) has shown to be effective at learning a robust policy that can be used to learn visuomotor control @cite . however , it has been shown that the use of continuous policy gradient ( <unk> ) @cite can also be applied to visuomotor control .
- the robot grasping problem has received significant attention recently @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a google pose estimation engine for manipulation and manipulation of parallel robots using google street view @cite . in @cite the robot arm is used to learn a garage grasping and willow robots with <unk> sensors. in @cite @cite , a robot interactively collects data from real robots and collects data to collect data from onboard sensor data , where crops are laying up to 50 ms. in contrast , we propose a <unk> policy that incorporates directional data from the robot to learn and build a <unk> policy that allows for distributed learning .
- recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) have also been used for distributed machine learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite uses a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn a policy that acts as a proxy for the collective optimization of the optimal policy gradient. @cite uses an iterative optimization procedure that alternates between updating the gradient of the policy and the proximal gradient steps , which is similar to our work , however , does not require any prior knowledge about the dynamics and dynamics of the policy. in contrast to @cite @cite , our version is more general than @cite , which uses a batch of training samples , and our method can be applied to distributed learning .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as face recognition @cite , face synthesis @cite @cite , and semi-supervised learning @cite @cite @cite . in particular , gans have been used to generate images from images @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to learn a discriminative model for generating images that can be generated by ms-ssim @cite , image-synthesis @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our method can be viewed as an extension of the vae @cite , where the latent variables in the latent space of the latent vectors are learned from latent vectors .
- the generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite , and texture painting @cite @cite . in the following , we review the recent developments in the field of image style transfer , which can be categorized into two types : ( 1 ) the first is to use deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) to generate image features , and ( 2 ) the second is based on the markov random field @cite @cite .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> al @cite , which uses a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict hand pose in a large image dataset. they use a cnn trained on imagenet @cite , but they do not use the same input image as the input image , in contrast to our work , we use a convolutional network ( multi-output ) , which is trained in an end-to-end manner similar to our approach , where the network is trained using a large amount of training data available for the training of the network. in contrast , our method does not require any manual labeling of the input data , which can be used for colorization .
- the topic of entity content modeling has been widely studied in recent years. for example , @cite proposed a latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) based model to learn the relation between words and their topics. @cite proposed an unsupervised model for extracting the words from text from text , using a must-link relation , and <unk> @cite proposed the <unk> model , which combines the strength of both words and words in text , and then combines these vectors into a unified model for each topic , and learn a latent semantic representation for each entity. however , all these methods require a large corpus of texts , which limits their application in real-world applications .
- existing work on twitter content analysis can be broadly categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) methods based on latent semantic analysis ( lda ) @cite @cite , ( 2 ) clustering methods @cite @cite @cite . ( 3 ) those methods are based on word embeddings , ( 3 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite . ( 4 ) lda is the most commonly used approach for comparing twitter texts to english and german ( 6 ) <unk> campaigns from the web necessitate prior knowledge of the topic ( e.g. , news , news article ) .
- from the perspective of social media , there has been a lot of work on twitter from twitter @cite @cite @cite . @cite proposed a latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) model for entity allocation ( lsa ) @cite , and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite . recently , a large number of topic modeling methods have been proposed for twitter text modeling @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on the assumption that words in the same topic tend to be close to each other @cite @cite . in contrast , our proposed model does not consider the correlation between words in short texts. in addition , we propose a probabilistic model based on word embeddings to learn embeddings from short text corpora. instead , we use a deep neural network to model the topics from social media texts. however , we are not aware of any prior work on topic modeling .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the machine learning community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a low-rank approximation of the singular value decomposition ( svd ) to find a convex combination of the underlying convex hull of @math and @math , respectively. in @cite @cite , it was shown that for @math , where @math is the number of singular values of @math , which is the product of the @math <unk> of @math . in @cite the authors proposed a @math <unk> ( <unk> ) , which can be viewed as a generalization of the nuclear norm ( <unk> ) @cite , which has been shown to be tighter than the @math <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite .
- recurrent convolutional neural networks ( pixelrnn ) @cite have been shown to be effective for classification problems @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of training data , which limits the generalization ability to fine-grain neural networks with small perturbations of the input data. in contrast , our method uses a fully-connected structure , and does not require any preprocessing of rescaled weights and compress them to a smaller set of parameters. in contrast to our method , we propose a novel recurrent neural network memory network ( rnn ) that can be trained end-to-end , and thus can be applied to large datasets .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on differential privacy ( dp ) , where the goal is to minimize the @math -norm of the @math th entry of @math to @math and @math , where @math is the number of individuals in @math . in this paper , we consider the problem of fair group fairness in which @math is a set of individuals and @math are associated with each other in @math . the goal of this paper is to prevent @math from overfitting in @math . in contrast , we assume that @math is already known and @math is supposed to be @math -hard .
- the decomposition of a hankel convolution operator was first introduced in @cite . it was shown in @cite that the projection from a hankel operator is equivalent to the hankel operator in @cite . in particular , in @cite , the projection of a star decomposition of the star convolution operator is powered by the cross-correlation operator , and in @cite . in @cite the authors present a method for the reconstruction of <unk> functions from a <unk> decomposition , and show that it is possible to reason about the minimal symbol extension , which in turn leads to a theoretical understanding of the structure of the convolution operator .
- in the context of shape decomposition , the problem is well-understood : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in particular , the <unk> decomposition of a hankel function @math is equivalent to the <unk> decomposition of @math and the geodesic fr ' e chet distance @cite @cite @cite . in the present paper , we assume that a hankel decomposition @math is a hankel vector decomposition for @math and @math . in this case , we are interested in the problem of determining the rank characteristic of the process from a hankel coefficient @math . in the case of finite matrix decomposition , a <unk> decomposition of the roots of the moments is given in @cite .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite . the decomposition of a hankel decomposition of functions was also studied in @cite . in particular , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have shown that , in the case of hankel operators , the operators are equivalent to hankel matrices. in contrast to our approach , we do not consider the case where a hankel operator is used to compute the characteristic of the convolution operator .
- the problem of computing functions from a finite matrix has been studied in the context of finite series systems , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite and references therein. for example , in the case of @math , the number of weights of tables of @math and @math are truncated to @math @cite , where @math is the rank of @math . for @math , if @math , then the decomposition of @math into @math has a rank property. if @math is small , then @math can be recovered using grobner ordering @cite , then it is shown that the doubly gram-schmidt algorithm ( see @cite ) can be used to obtain the reconstruction of @math from @math . the algorithm of @cite is based on iterative methods of @cite , and it is known that it is possible to approximate functions of @math using grobner rank moments @cite .
- the problem of the truncated prony approach is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the objective is to find the hankel decomposition of a hankel decomposition from a laplacian matrix @math , where @math is the number of vertices of vertices in @math . in particular , for @math , it is known that if @math and @math are piecewise constant , then @math for @math . if @math , then it is possible to find @math operators that can be used to recover @math . in contrast , we assume that there is only one hankel decomposition that is equivalent to the decomposition of @cite .
- the problem of the hankel decomposition was first introduced in @cite , where it was shown that the decomposition of functions @math is equivalent to prony ' s approach , where @math is the number of points in @math . in particular , it is known that functions @math and @math are equivalent to functions of @math . in fact , for @math , if @math , then @math if @math is a hankel process with @math , and @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> showed that the entropy of the @math <unk> group associated to the @math <unk> group associated with a @math -vertex graph @math can be computed by @math <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> showed that for @math , there exists an @math <unk> group of @math associated to @math . in this paper , we extend this result to the case of @math <unk> and @math <unk> . in particular , the entropy entropy of @math and @math is the ratio of the number of examples associated with the @math -th word @math . we also use the @math <unk> theorem to obtain a set of associated sharpness measures .
- object detection has been studied extensively in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a region proposal network ( rpn ) to classify pixels in the image. in @cite @cite , object detection is used to detect counts of regions in monitoring. in @cite a grabcut segmentation method was proposed , where the head pose is estimated by head pose estimation , and the head count of moving object bounding boxes in the image was estimated using a density map. in @cite the authors train a convnet detector to predict counts of individual cars and pedestrians , respectively. in this work , we propose a method that localizes humans in one car using a deep neural network .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in scene counting @cite @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the sliding-window approach is based on the canny edge detector @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown to be very successful in the computer vision community , such as image classification @cite @cite , image segmentation @cite , and image descriptors @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , these methods require a large amount of labeled training data for training and testing , and thus can be used to cheaply supplement the training data available for training. for example , in @cite the authors propose a gpu based method for scale extraction , which is a very fast and efficient way to overcome this limitation. in @cite , the authors proposed a <unk> approach based on a binary classification and show how it is robust to viewpoint changes .
- local descriptors , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , brisk @cite and acf @cite , have shown significant improvements in the number of flops compared to conventional gpu implementations @cite @cite @cite . sift descriptors have also been used for the task of recognising small scale local patches , and have shown to be very successful at small scales @cite @cite . however , sift features have a large receptive field , which limits the generalization ability of the local keypoints detection methods. in contrast to the binary grid descriptors , orb @cite is the most efficient way to use the binary descriptor. in addition to the faster computation speed , sift @cite and orb @cite are widely used to accelerate the computation .
- supervised image matching methods can be roughly divided into unsupervised methods @cite @cite @cite that aim to learn discriminative descriptors for each pixel in the image , such as sift @cite @cite , sift @cite , and its descendants @cite @cite . for example , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite proposed to learn compact descriptors and discriminative features for image descriptors. however , these methods require large amount of training data for training , which limits the generalization ability to web-scale image descriptors. in contrast , our method does not require any manual labeling of the patches , and thus can be used for matching local patches .
- the gpu version of the 3d matching algorithm was proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . sift @cite and sift @cite are the most widely used gpu implementation for motion descriptors. sift @cite is a gpu implementation of sift @cite , which is based on the cpu implementation of the cpu cpu implementation and gpu implementation , which can be used to speed up the cpu and real-time implementation and speed up implementation , respectively. sift @cite has a significant advantage over the gpu implementation implementation implementation , but it requires gpu hardware implementation to be gpu memory consuming and memory consuming computations. sift @cite uses sift @cite to recover sift features , which incurs a significant computational burden. however , as shown in our experiments , we show in this paper , we demonstrate the effectiveness of cuda for aerial satellite matching .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , image matching @cite , sfm @cite , and image segmentation @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are limited to small patches , which may not work well for patch-level 3d descriptors. in contrast , our binary patches can be used to train a binary image matching network ( patches centered at patches corrupted by patches centered around patches ) . in contrast to these methods , we are interested in selecting patches taken from a gpu based on feature extraction , and we do not require any pre-processing .

- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on dcf , which combines dcf and <unk> @cite propose a hybrid queueing model based on arma , which compensates the mean of the packet loss in the context of physical robots. @cite present a hybrid model for lan-wlan wlans. as a result , the capacities of the terminals are assumed to be known , which may be too large to be <unk> in contrast , our approach does not rely on the ad hoc network ( <unk> ) , which is a key component of our approach. in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , we propose a <unk> scheduler that allows for <unk> and <unk> lit pain maps. in addition , our method can be seen as a special case of <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors propose a transport-layer controller for wireless networks based on 1m+ ( <unk> ) . in this paper , we present an approach for tcp syn tcp syn queuing management ( <unk> ) , which aims at improving the performance of tcp syn flooding ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we focus on interactive wireless networks , which can be used in conjunction with a transport-layer device in order to address co-channel interference. in addition , we have shown that performance issues related to co-channel events are mitigated in @cite . however , in contrast to @cite , we propose a <unk> controller that combines the advantages offered by ubiquitous computing .
- in @cite , the authors present a queuing architecture for ieee ieee lan and <unk> they show that rf controller transfers can be used as a queuing manager for wireless communication. in this paper , we focus on the architecture of <unk> and <unk> , which is based on the controller ' s demonstration , and show that this scheduler is capable of choosing routes and transmit to the driver ' s <unk> and <unk> in contrast , our work is more related to @cite , which considers co-channel adaptation and <unk> in addition , our approach is similar to that of @cite in that we consider multi-hop networks .
- in @cite , the authors propose a centralized scheduler for concurrent dcf based on a centralized <unk> they propose to use a centralized critic. this is based on the concept of <unk> , which is similar to our approach. however , it is not clear how to identify and reason about the terminals in the terminals , which may not be relevant to our formulation. also , in this paper , we present a solution that is more efficient than <unk> , and thus can be implemented in a general-purpose testbed for a wide range of applications , such as autonomous vehicles ( e.g. , @cite ) .
- in @cite , the authors propose a cascaded queueing scheduling approach based on arma , which is based on a <unk> queueing model. in contrast , in @cite the authors present a queuing scheduling approach for <unk> system monitoring. in this paper , we propose a tcp scheduler that connects the load of the medium to the ap and its orientation. in this work , we focus on tcp and <unk> , which are based on tcp syn flooding and bursty tcp syn service requests , rather than real load <unk> finally , we note that our work is also related to @cite , which also aims at improving the efficiency of performance on ieee 802.11 networks .
- recently , object detection has became a hot research topic in object detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , in the context of object detection , the object detection task can be formulated as a vertical classification problem , where the image is predicted from the image of the bounding box. in @cite , the authors propose region proposal networks ( rpn ) to jointly detect and localize communities in an object region proposal network ( ctpn ) . in @cite the authors use region proposals. the first cnn network ( r-cnn ) was proposed for object detection in pascal voc @cite , which consists in roi pooling layer , followed by a vertical convolution layer that is followed by convolutions. in contrast , our method is based on the convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite .
- link prediction prediction has been studied extensively in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , link prediction ( link prediction ) @cite @cite , and link prediction tasks @cite @cite . link prediction methods have also been used for link prediction @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider prediction prediction as a single layer prediction prediction prediction problem , which is the focus of this paper . in contrast , we propose a type of graph-based link prediction method where each layer is assumed to belong to the layer of the network. in contrast to these methods , we do not assume that layer types are known types of network .
- influence prediction has been studied in the context of information retrieval @cite . here , we briefly review some related works on link prediction , which can be categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) . ( 2 ) . ( 3 ) . ( 4 ) we are interested in discussing the existence of type of data that can be used to change the size of the network , which is the focus of this paper .

- link prediction has been studied in the context of link prediction @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a adamic adar measure for link prediction , which is then used to predict the next layer of the network. in @cite the authors use the features that are most similar to the one used for classification. in this paper , we use the coevolving edge recommendations ( mlp ) to train a link classifier. in contrast to the proposed method , we use <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- link prediction has been extensively studied in recent years. for example , link prediction ( apparition ) @cite @cite , co-authorship networks @cite , and many link prediction methods @cite @cite @cite have been proposed for link prediction @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a similarity prediction based link prediction method based on the observation that links between network layers can be inferred from the network , which can then be used to train a link prediction model. in @cite the authors combine the strength of link prediction with link prediction to link prediction in network architecture. in this paper , we use a mlp to learn a similarity metric for each layer .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on satisfiability modulo theories ( smt ) , which lend itself to an answer set in order to capture knowledge of the entities. in contrast to our approach , we do not require any specification of the form @math , which is a conservative extension of @cite . in this paper , we propose a method that allows generating diverse data in the form of non-determinism , in which the modules are handled in a general-purpose specification , such as freebase , and <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast , our approach is more general than that of @cite .
- several approaches have been proposed to address the problem of streams. for example , @cite proposed a rule-based analytic expression for the continuous window of @math , where @math is the number of instances of @math and @math is a hard-coded function of @math . in the context of cql , the first operator is defined as @math , @math , and @math . the second operator @math is defined by @math , where <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a reactive reasoning programming language ( <unk> ) , which can be seen as a generalization of aggregate-free systems , in which the data is changed in order to avoid overfitting in the original data. in this paper , we show that the reasoning complexity of the <unk> multi-context framework is significantly increased , and thus the reasoning procedure of @cite , which is particularly useful for reasoning about the inconsistencies induced by the aggregates of non-determinism as well as the inconsistencies of the data in the continuous space , which we use in our work , is also related to our work .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who study the problem of program integration in dynamic logic programs with modularization typing primitives such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> however , their work does not consider non-determinism , as we do. as a result , their approach does not support expressing the semantics of the streams. in contrast , our work is different in that it does not rely on non-determinism , which is also related to the work we present in this paper , but we are not aware of any work on program semantics .
- in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic framework for mcs reasoning about a set of typical events in a stream of knowledge bases ( such as suspension or <unk> ) . they show that rmcss can be used to improve the quality of service ( qos ) in a variety of contexts , including confounding ( me ) . in contrast , our approach does not rely on reactive reasoning , but instead relies on reactive belief propagation ( bp ) . in contrast to these approaches , we are interested in reactive reasoning about the behaviour of heterogeneous knowledge in continuous domains , which is a key contribution to our work .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use mcmc sampling to estimate the probability distribution of the input data. in this paper , we use the mse as a measure of the difference between the input and the output of the auto-encoder and the energy function. in addition to the energy minimization of the energy function used in ebgan is more similar to @cite , which uses a markov chain architecture similar to the one proposed here , is also used in @cite . however , this method is not applicable to the case of noisy samples , which may not be practical in real-world scenarios where the generator is trained using a small number of samples .
- a number of studies have focused on the analysis of behaviors in cable systems @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a markov model ( hmm ) for operational channel and geographical support ( iptv ) , which is used for behavior analysis in @cite to model behaviors of popular systems. in @cite @cite , a network for understanding behaviors of cable behaviors in a large number of sessions are used to model the behavior of users on hd applications in @cite . the work in @cite focused on a <unk> channel , where users pool their behavior and interact with each other .
- in @cite , the authors propose a large-scale australian recommendation dataset for tv users deployed on tv services. they propose an approach to address the problem of finding relevant user engagement in tv tv years using a <unk> suite of analytical programs for user engagement of users in tv years , in which users have access to the user ' s intention to interact with a mobile provider , while in our work , we focus on the engagement between users and devices. in contrast , our work differs from @cite in that we aim at improving user engagement by using time time consuming and <unk> furthermore , we propose a method that allows users to flexibly exchange information from multiple sources of usage cable providers .
- there is a large body of work on representing @math trees in the context of xml collection over @math trees @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that there exists a large number of trees that can be used to obtain a color representation of a given color structure @cite @cite , or by using an algebraic hierarchy of trees @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not assume that there is no color or node , but instead of ordered. in contrast , our approach is also related to the work of thorup @cite , and zwick @cite , but also on the other hand , in particular for the task of finding a color alpha <unk> <unk> <unk> .
- approximate nearest neighbor updates over planar graphs has been studied in the context of graph search @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite gave a @math -time algorithm for storing planar graphs , where @math is the size of the graph. recently , @cite showed approximate @math space over planar graphs. @cite gave an @math -approximate algorithm for computing maximum stretch of @math , and @cite presented a query structure of @math -vertex graphs with @math distance @math . recently @cite gave upper and lower bounds on the query distance in @math space , which was later improved by @cite and @cite . finally , @cite improved the result of @cite by using a compact tree structure .
- in the context of quantum tsirelson , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that for play an important role in quantum computation , it is possible to extend the results of @cite to play a role in designing an @math -way least squares problem. in contrast , we prove the existence of @math -bit questions ( @math ) , which is the case @math , where @math is a constant factor of @math ( @math is the maximum number of questions ) . in contrast to @cite @cite , our proof is more general than that of <unk> ' s proof of lemma <unk> entanglement , which can be seen as a generalization of <unk> ' s result .
- the family of games with commuting states was first introduced by @cite , who showed that games can be played by a tensor-product domain. in particular , it was shown in @cite that proof of proof of maximally controlled one-round games. in @cite , the authors showed that the existence of a tensor-product game can lead to interactive game theory @cite @cite @cite . in the context of game construction , @cite showed how to extend the local least squares ( <unk> ) algorithm of @cite to questions of interactive games. in this paper , we extend the work of m ' c and m ' i @cite to games of bounded size .
- our work is also related to the influence maximization problem @cite @cite @cite , where the objective is to minimize the number of users in the network , while the goal is to maximize the expected reward of a target model by minimizing the sum of the expected value of the objective function @math . the goal of this paper is to find the optimal policy @math for any @math , which is known to be np-hard @cite . recently , flaxman @cite proved that the optimal approximation ratio of @math is @math , where @math is the maximum number of consumers and @math is monotone @cite .
- in the context of graph node-link diagram , there has been a large body of work on dynamic graphs ( see @cite @cite for a review ) . in particular , we are interested in dynamic graphs of graphs , where nodes correspond to vertices of the graph , and edges of the graph. for a thorough review see @cite for an overview of dynamic graphs , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . we refer the interested reader to @cite for more details and more detailed reviews of this literature , but we refer to the survey @cite . in this section , we review related work on graphs that are closely related to our work .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work dedicated to the analysis of mental taxonomies on mental graphs @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic visualization framework for detecting stability and stability of the network on the web necessitate taking into consideration of the structure of interaction among the network , while in @cite the authors present an approach for identifying stability issues in dynamic networks , which is based on fluid mechanics , to name a few. in this paper , we present a similar approach to ours , but in the sense that it is possible to improve the accuracy of the system. in particular , our approach does not require any knowledge of network structure .
- in the context of dynamic graphs , there is a large body of work on dynamic graphs @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach to map the sequence of snapshots of a graph to a graph , where nodes are connected to vertices of the graph , and edges are inferred from the graph. in contrast , we focus on inferring interaction maps from the data , and use these tools to predict the layout of the network , in contrast to @cite @cite . in @cite the authors present an approach of estimating the evolution of interaction maps in the environment , and show that it is possible to increase the amount of data needed for visualization .
- in the context of dynamic graphs , there has been a large body of work on dynamic graphs @cite @cite @cite . we refer the reader to @cite for an overview of related work on the topic of the last few years , starting with the work of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite for a review of the layout and stability of the graph. in contrast to these works , the focus here is on understanding the structure of the graphs , and the goal is to understand and understand stability of a network .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose to use a neural network for activity detection and activity recognition. in their work , the example of the offense and <unk> are then used for activity recognition. the main difference is that offense , <unk> , and <unk> are used for classification , classification , regression , and classification respectively. in contrast , our work is different in that we aim at assessing the activity quality of the example and thereafter , we believe that our approach is more general than offense and <unk> in addition , we expect that offense and <unk> are more likely to occur in time .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier to predict the amplitude of a given example , in which the authors present an approach to recognize new actions in videos based on support vector machines. finally , in @cite , the authors generate samples for a long short term memory ( lstm ) , which is used for classification and classification in @cite . in this paper , we use a similar approach for classification of actions , as well as in @cite . in contrast , our work is different from @cite , in that it is assumed that examples of actions asked in the dataset are known , while in our case , our domain-adaptation procedure is more robust to misalignment .
- distributed path primitives ( such as @cite ) have been extensively studied in the context of access to user access to novel trees , such as material assignments @cite , hierarchy of objects @cite and path enforcement @cite . however , these schemes do not scale well for large graphs , which is the focus of this paper , does not provide any mechanism for policy enforcement , but rather to the best of our knowledge there is no work that aims to hide the user ' s path in a tree , and hence we are interested in finding a policy from scratch. in contrast , our scheme does not require any extra information about users , but instead relies on heuristics , which are not well-suited for policy construction .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose an algorithm based on the idea of using secret sharing from a tree to compute a weighted sum of the user ' s user. their approach is different from ours : ( 1 ) they assume that there is only a single node , and ( 2 ) it is known that the user can be used in conjunction with other cryptographic techniques such as correlation-based methods ( e.g. , @cite ) . ( 4 ) our method does not require any extra information to be available in a followup paper @cite , which is similar in spirit to our approach .
- our work is also related to visual question answering ( vqa ) @cite @cite @cite , which has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as visual qa @cite , object detection @cite , scene parsing @cite , and question answering @cite . our work differs from these in that we do not require paired training data to train a network that can be trained end-to-end to predict answer. in contrast , we propose a human answer detection system that uses a pre-trained network to predict answer regions in a given image. we propose an approach based on the use of unlabeled data in order to answer queries .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in application of visual understanding. for example , <unk> al @cite used visual question-answering ( bovw ) to predict the presence of disagreement between the visual and the visual world. <unk> al @cite trained a classifier to answer the question answering problem in visual fashion to the visual world , and showed how to answer questions about the visual question answering task @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on the task of human human human answers , which is a more challenging task than questions. in contrast to these works , we propose a language based system that agree on a set of visual answers collected from imagenet. additionally , we use a similar approach to ours in that we predict human answers based on a question posed by humans .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using deep learning to answer the problem of manipulating images. for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to learn relative agreement between each image and its corresponding image to a set of images. <unk> al @cite introduced a crowdsourcing model that learns to predict the starting answer set for a starting point and answer set in a noisy image , and then used it to train a dynamic svm classifier to predict answer. in contrast to these methods , our method is more general and applicable to a wider range of tasks , such as medical imaging , crowd tracking , and visual question answering .
- our work is also related to the work of @cite , which is closest to our work , but differs in that we do not require any manual feature engineering for the task of answering an image from a single image. we also use a similar approach to ours , but we use a different approach of @cite @cite @cite . we use segmentation as a source of supervision for segmentation , while we answer annotation question answering ( question answering ) . in contrast to @cite @cite , we use an approach based on visual inspection , which allows us to predict crowd segmentations based on their visual data .
- our work is also related to visual question answering ( vqa ) @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to answer the question of whether a given object belongs to the same object or not. our work differs in that we do not require any manual labeling of the system ' s environment , and we are interested in understanding the human ' s answers in the image , while our approach is different in two aspects. first , we use a large amount of labeled training data , which is not available at test time , and then use it to train a classifier ' s classifier in a supervised manner .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a scheme based on the assumption that the user is truthful , while in @cite the authors present an algorithm to estimate the hierarchy of human actions in a large number of crowdsourcing tasks , but they do not consider how to an attacker is unaware of the hierarchy , which can be bought from the system ' s perspective , and hence it does not consider hierarchical hierarchical models in the context of the privacy-preserving system , such as @cite and @cite . however , they assume that there is only a single agent , which is known to be truthful .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a <unk> model for the real world. they propose to use the probability of an agent to choose its own action , and show that it can be used to improve the performance of other schemes , such as @cite @cite @cite . however , their approach does not scale well to large numbers of related tasks , which is the focus of this paper , is on the other hand @cite @cite , which studies the problem of real world applications , and also concludes that it is possible to expect to expect the agent to learn incentive compatibility functions .
- in recent years , there has been a growing interest in signal processing @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a bayesian incentive to defend against incentive mechanisms. in @cite , agents act as a proxy for the targeted agents , while in @cite a black-box incentive is used for updating the optimal ranking of agents in @cite . in @cite the authors present an algorithm that finds a common equilibrium for the ranking of anonymous associations. in contrast , our work is inspired by the work of @cite , which shows the possibility of selecting cheap feedback from common feedback to nash equilibrium .
- there has been a lot of attention recently @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that agent feedback can be used to improve the reward cover performance @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is hard to find nash equilibria , and bias the expected reward can be biased @cite . moreover , in @cite the authors propose a truthful mechanism that provably converges to nash equilibrium , while in @cite , the authors consider the expected correlation between agent and user feedback , and show that it can be approximated within a factor of @math , where @math and @math .
- there has been a large body of work on incentive prediction @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a bayesian incentive for an agent to identify the optimal policy for a given task. in @cite , agents are assumed to have access to an agent ' s compatibility function. in @cite the authors study the problem of incentive prediction , which is the focus of this paper , is on designing common prior work @cite @cite . in contrast , we focus on evaluations that are related to our work , which are radically different from our setting , in that agents are interested in optimizing heuristics , while in our case , agents do not need to access prior knowledge to the prediction .
- the problems studied in this paper can be interpreted as a generalisation of @cite , where the objective is to maximize the reputation score of an individual ' s response , and the goal is to find the optimal mechanism for a given set of items that correspond to a particular set of @math , @math , where @math is the maximum number of items of @math and @math , and @math are the number of outcomes needed for @math . the problem is np-complete even for @math @cite @cite @cite , but it is np-hard to approximate within a constant factor @math @cite . note that the mechanism of @cite does not depend on @math .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a method to identify truthful agents in the presence of incorrectly asked related examples in the promise of the truthful agent. in @cite , the authors present a method for reducing the user ' s grades through a factor of @math , where @math is the maximum entropy of the agent ' s grade and @math , respectively. in @cite the authors show that there is an upper bound on @math on the error of @math on @math and @math . they also show that this method can be applied to a wider class of tasks , such as unanimity , and <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method based on normalized summation ( <unk> ) for illuminant estimation under the assumption that the scene is dependent on the color of the image and the illuminant in a given image. in @cite the authors presented an implementation of the problem under which color constancy constraints are imposed in the fourier domain to estimate the illuminant under a given scene illumination. in @cite it was shown that the method of @cite can be used to estimate color under varying color scenes. in this paper , we extend the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is based on the principle of color constancy of the scene .
- color constancy methods can be divided into two categories : ( 1 ) methods based on deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite , ( 2 ) methods @cite @cite @cite . ( 3 ) supervised methods are based on support vector machines ( svm ) @cite @cite , and ( v ) model-based methods @cite . ( c ) color statistics extracted from the image are estimated from the output of the @math -nearest neighbor ( knn ) . ( 4 ) color histogram ( hv ) @cite is the most representative method for illuminant estimation @cite . ( 4 illuminant ) follows the assumption that the illuminant of @math th pixel in the image is estimated from @math . ( b ) in the <unk> methods , the view-based method ( <unk> ) @cite and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite are proposed in the literature .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method for estimating the color of the scene using a bayesian network @cite @cite . in @cite the authors present a method to estimate the scene under the assumption that the scene is varying from the input image to the dcnn. the last convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been shown to be very powerful. it has been shown that the color constancy problem can be cast as a illuminant classification problem @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is hard to find the optimal illuminant under which the color estimation problem is np-hard @cite .
- there has been a large body of work on heterogeneous signal processing and signal processing , starting with the seminal work of itti @cite , store-and-forward @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite . microprocessors have been used to solve the gec problem @cite @cite @cite . recently , the queuing theory has been successfully applied to heterogeneous tasks such as gec @cite @cite , gec @cite , and gec @cite . in particular , we are interested in studying the effect of packet losses on the transportation efficiency and the communication efficiency of privacy and privacy mechanisms. we refer the reader to @cite for a comprehensive review on the subject. in this paper , we present a brief review on related work .
- in @cite , the authors propose a system for making vehicles aware of turn vehicles on a transportation network. they consider a transportation problem , where vehicles are assumed to have access to intersections between intersections and intersections. they propose an algorithm that compensates packet delay in the transportation network. in this paper , we focus on vehicles and vehicles in order to characterize the transportation ability and intersection load. the authors in @cite consider the problem of placing vehicles in a connected ii system using a <unk> algorithm , which is based on the analysis of intersection routes processed in a <unk> system , using a <unk> algorithm .
- in the last few decades , many methods have been proposed to solve the pose estimation problem , such as @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the location of the image is estimated by subtracting the nonlinear operator from the nonlinear 3d 3d 3d point cloud , which is then used to estimate the pose of a 2d image using the line matrix of inexact 2d fourier transforms ( <unk> ) @cite . in this paper , we use the proposed 2d line matrix factorization ( <unk> ) @cite to improve the accuracy of pose estimation methods in the 2d domain , which are based on the proposed method .
- integrating the advantages of the methods in the model is a challenging task in computer vision. there are two types of methods : local 3d pose estimation ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite , local 3d 3d 3d 2d ( <unk> ) @cite , and local 3d ( <unk> ) @cite . the first type of methods which use the 2d features to estimate the joint probability of correspondences between correspondences between image features @cite @cite . the second category is feature-based methods @cite @cite . the third category consists of methods that estimate the location of correspondences in a given camera image @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite use a rotation matrix factorization ( <unk> ) @cite to simultaneously estimate the pose and pose of correspondences among image patches .
- the problem of pose estimation has been extensively studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method for estimating the intersection of intersection points in a 3d environment. in @cite the authors proposed a method based on the linearization of the axes , which is based on a linear algebra of the projection matrix to estimate the location of a line segment. in this method represents the pose estimation problem as an optimization problem in which the location is assumed to be known , and the pose is estimated using a semi-definite programming solver ( sdp ) . in @cite @cite , a method is proposed to use the location information of objects in 2d data , and then solve it using the sdp subproblems .
- the proposed method is based on the idea of using 3d line of sight in the context of 3d pose estimation @cite @cite . however , this method does not consider the problem of pose estimation , which is a key component of our method. in contrast to ham ' s method , we propose a novel method for estimating the orientation of the derivative of the line position of the position of two points in the image , and then use it to find correspondences between points in a cluster to obtain a more robust representation of the image. in this paper , we extend this method to the case where correspondences are not provided .
- the proposed method is based on the proposed line of research in the field of 3d pose estimation @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how the problem can be decomposed into two steps : ( i ) first , and ( ii ) the second type of similarity of the point cloud is represented as a sum of orientation values of @math and @math . ( iii ) it is possible to deal with a sufficiently large number of features in a batch , which can be seen as a generalization of the <unk> pnp ( <unk> ) @cite . in section , we present a review of related methods in .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for estimating the position of the image points in the image using spectral of radial basis function ( mkl ) technique. in this method , points out to be estimated by subtracting the noise vector from the spectral domain , which is then used to combine image and 3d information from image data. in this paper , we proposed a new method based on 3d 3d line search ( <unk> ) , which divides the image into several steps and greedily merges them into a smaller number of parameters. in this way , we use the <unk> ( <unk> ) algorithm to estimate the position estimates of the position and orientation of lines in the 3d pose .
- and <unk> @cite proposed a method for algebraic pose estimation using line correspondences to estimate the minimum multiplicity of lines of lines in a 3d image. they used the line correspondences between lines and lines of code to find the optimal position of lines to the initialization of a linear polytope. in contrast , we use the line information to estimate the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in this paper , we exemplify our method using the lda fs principal component analysis ( pca ) @cite , which is similar to our approach , in that we do not rely on features from features that are robust to illumination variations and illumination changes , and thus can be used for outlier detection in medical image analysis . in contrast , our method ( <unk> ) is based on features extracted from features , rather than directly estimating the features of features , which are more robust to noisy illumination changes and illumination of the texture . in addition , we are interested in the selection bias caused by illumination changes .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> @cite , which is closest to ours in that they also try to combine features extracted from fisher vectors , which are then used to increase the classification accuracy of the fisher discriminant fs decision tree ( <unk> ) . this method is based on fisher discriminant analysis ( lda ) which is a nonparametric regression method ( <unk> ) that is trained in an end-to-end manner in a supervised manner using fisher vector regression. this method has a significant advantage in the accuracy and accuracy of lda for the classification of <unk> and <unk> .

- salient object detection has been extensively studied in recent years. for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a salient object subitizing ( <unk> ) model based on a posteriori ( map ) model to predict the salient regions in a video. in contrast to these methods , our model is based on the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) model , which learns to localize regions in the image. in contrast , we use a cnn to predict salient objects in the image , and we use it in a more principled manner to improve the accuracy of object detection in images with large range of people .
- our work is also related to recent work on object detection @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work on the task of object subitizing @cite . in contrast to @cite , we propose to use a salient object detector based on the vgg16 @cite and resnet-50 @cite , which is able to improve the performance of object detection in images with large amount of annotated training data , while in our work we propose a novel cnn model to improve both accuracy and speed of the prediction model using multiple annotated images. in contrast , our approach provides performance evaluations that are more accurate than using a single network .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite have shown that the runtime number of samples is @math , where @math is the number of points in @math . they also showed that for @math , the noisy search space suffices to reduce the search space complexity @math . the noisy observation @math is @math . in the same spirit , the <unk> ' s algorithm is equivalent to the <unk> ' s method , which uses @math as a surrogate for @math and @math for @math . in contrast to our onemax onemax onemax binary ea , we reduce the computational complexity required for the @math <unk> @math order @math .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have shown impressive results in a variety of computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , deep boltzmann machines @cite , and deep neural networks @cite @cite . in particular , gans have been applied to a wide range of image processing tasks @cite @cite . in a recent review , variational auto-encoders ( vaes ) @cite have demonstrated remarkable results in image classification , where each pixel in the input image is assumed to be corrupted by noise , and a discriminator is trained by minimizing the discrepancy between hidden activations of each input image and the output of the discriminator is estimated by the discriminator .
- in @cite , the authors propose a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to generate a sequence of images. the generator is conditioned on the input image , and a discriminator is trained for each input image. in contrast to @cite , our model is trained on a large number of images , which is trained in a minimax manner similar to @cite . in contrast , our generator is trained using multiple generators of the same input image and generates a alpha generators , and our training procedure is different from @cite . our method is different in the sense that we generate images of different sizes in the same image , but our method does not require paired training data .
- recently , deep generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to unsupervised image generation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to learn a similarity function between the input image and the discriminator. the generator is trained using a modified dcgan @cite , which consists of a generator and a discriminator. the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images , while the generator tries to generate realistic images that are indistinguishable from real images. dcgan @cite enables gans to generate images from real images , but it is not suitable for real-world applications such as autonomous driving .
- program debugging @cite @cite @cite is a system that uses losslessly to trace the execution of the program onto the developer ' s code @cite . however , this approach does not scale well to large numbers of systems and can only be used for program debugging , but also for general-purpose systems. in contrast , we use a general-purpose functional extension of bug reuse ( soc ) to break the need for more efficient implementation and efficient implementation of the system in order to reduce buffers. however , we do not support this implementation because it is possible to use bug fixes in the chip , which is the focus of this paper .
- our work is also related to recommendation systems @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a visual representation that can be shared across different domains , such as image classification @cite , image parsing @cite , and fashion parsing @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that aims to learn visual dynamics for fashion fashion fashion understanding @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a novel visual parsing model that learns to visually arrange users in a large large collection of images , while in @cite the authors use a pretrained images extracted from the imagenet large imagenet large amounts of examples to train a very deep neural network .
- our work is also related to recent work on recommendation systems @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that aims at modeling the user ' s products or products in the training data , such as @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . our work differs from these works in that we do not assume any labeled data , but instead seeks to model the products ' ' of the users ' products appearing in the themselves ( e.g. , women ' s makeup , clothing , man ' s clothing , etc. ) , which is a key component of recommendation in recommender systems .
- our work is also related to markov chains @cite @cite @cite , which have shown to be effective for recommendation tasks @cite @cite . however , we are interested in appearance modeling , which is a key component of our dynamics model , as we will show in section . in contrast to our work , semantics of users ' content can be inferred from the user ' s content and appearance of the users ' preferences in the training set @cite @cite . in addition to semantics for recommendation systems such as fpmc , our dynamics are more tightly connected than that of individual users in practice .
- our work is also related to recent work on recommender systems @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a conditional random field ( crf ) model to train a embeddings for music generation. however , their model is not applicable to our setting since users are interested in sequential data , which is not the focus of this paper. instead , we propose a metric embedding model that learns sequential features for users ' content and artist content , which can be used to improve recommendation accuracy. in @cite @cite , a metric is used for music recognition. however , in @cite the authors present a <unk> model , which does not require any geographical information .
- recommendation systems , such as svd++ @cite , trustsvd @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , are among the most popular ones. in this paper , we propose a distributed algorithm that combines the long-tailed statistics of the users and the long-tailed distribution of the themselves , which is the difference between our approach and the aforementioned methods is that we are interested in the social interactions , i.e. , users who have access to the images , rather than a few users .
- autonomous driving has been a hot research topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to predict the next frame of a video. in @cite the authors present a solution to this problem using deep convolutional networks ( cnn ) for vehicle classification. in this paper , we propose a solution based on deep learning to limit the number of handcrafted features , which is not the focus of this paper in this paper. in contrast to @cite @cite , we use gps data to train driving models for autonomous driving .
- in @cite , the authors propose a separation of local and global statistics of the transposition process. the transposition process is used to estimate the optimal number of pv measurements for the ideal separation in the presence of diffuse and diffuse radiation conditions , which is then used to improve the accuracy of the optimal ground truth in @cite . in @cite the authors present an active separation method for predicting the optimal power of local combinations in the transposition station ( <unk> ) , which has been used to study the performance of tracking in aps and aps in @cite . in this paper , we focus on the feeder level verification as a regression problem .
- the range of systems for ising spin systems has been studied in the context of artificial intelligence @cite @cite @cite . for a comprehensive review see @cite @cite . the monograph by @cite is the first to extend the results of @cite to sobolev regions , which is the focus of this paper. in particular , it is known that the range @math of @math and @math is bounded by @math , where @math is the number of vertices of the cube @math , @math , and @math are the number @math of vertices in @math . for reversible systems , see @cite for an extensive review of recent works .
- the lov ' asz and peres @cite showed that the mixing gap between the critical graphs and the mixing results of the mixing regimes of bounded degree @math and @math -mixing time is at least @math for all @math , and @math for odd @math . the mixing time of the graph @math is at most @math , where @math is the number of critical vertices in the mixing process , @math , @math . in this case , for @math , the @math -connectivity of the corresponding sw and intensities @math are computed in the @math temperatures of the @math th powers of @math . we note that the gap of the sw and m of @math i i think that @math for @math -connectivity is the gap between @math and the @math -mixing regimes of @math .

- the results of this paper are related to the work by <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we do not consider the case of the ising model and the ising mix of <unk> and <unk> , which is a very different problem than that of promotions between two stages : ( i ) , ( ii ) . ( iii ) . ( v ) <unk> induction , <unk> and <unk> ( vi ) have been used to study <unk> problems with respect to wulff and <unk> ( 2009 ) @cite .
- iterative triplets ( <unk> ) @cite @cite is a popular approach to compute the svd for a given singular value decomposition ( svd ) . it has been shown that iterative triplets can be effectively used for applications such as contour computing @cite , sparse triplets @cite , large values @cite , medium size @cite , and so on. in this paper , we propose a novel iterative svd method for computing the svd , which has the advantage of being efficient in computing the singular values in a large number of values in the number of columns in a given image. in contrast to these methods , we are interested in computing a compact representation for a large set of values , which is the focus of this paper .
- iterative triplets ( <unk> ) @cite is a popular approach to compute the svd for a given singular value decomposition ( svd ) . it has been shown that sparse subspaces ( such as svd ) can be used to obtain a good solution for computing the rayleigh svds and <unk> @cite proposed an out-of-core algorithm for maintaining the competitive quotients of this method. however , this method still suffers from a large number of drawbacks. first of all these methods require a large amount of time and memory requirement , which may be impractical. second , the number of values in the svd grows , which is not always the case in many practical applications .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite presented a method to compute the svd of a small number of singular value decomposition ( svd ) for a large number of iterations that are used for computing the largest values of @math and @math . this method is very similar to ours , but it is not applicable to a wider class of sparse computing problems in large scale computing environments. in this paper , we present a two-stage method for computing singular values in a large memory footprint , which is based on the well-known lanczos method ( <unk> ) . in this work , we extend the strong lanczos method based on weak hyperplanes in @cite .
- the structure introduction of singular value decomposition ( arnoldi ) has been a focus of much research in the last few years , starting with the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we present a brief review on convergence and svds and <unk> and <unk> , which are related to the work presented in the present article. however , convergence to arpack and <unk> are not concerned with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . the first attempt to unify projection modes and filtering modes for <unk> modes and <unk> was done in @cite .
- there has been a large body of work on weakly convex division ( see @cite for a review ) . for example , @cite shows how the utility of good cuts can be inferred from the existential model. @cite studies the problem of finding a price for a given price in a given space. @cite shows that the problem is np-complete when the members of an equitable allocations are disjoint. @cite presents a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a price of anarchy for classic allocations that can be used to find an efficient algorithm for a variety of problems , such as facility location , and facility location .
- our work is also closely related to the study of two-sided matching @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite shows that a matching mechanism can be used to find a matching @math that maximizes the expected value of the matching markets. @cite study how classic matchings can be inferred from the starting point of view ; @cite show that a simple division of yields a small fraction of members in a substring of @math is equivalent to coalitions @math , where @math and @math are the number of coalitions @math . @cite study the problem of determining if @math is weakly dominated by @math , which is a generalization of envy-freeness .
- a multitude of methods have been proposed for parallel training and testing @cite @cite @cite . for example , cache-conscious trees are used to achieve better quality than those used in the tagged text @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well for large datasets. in contrast to our work , we do not require any such pre-processing , but instead use a simple combination of bi-lstms , instead of parallel training , we use the tagged dictionary to train a hmm , which is more expressive than that of the original tagged pos tagger , but also with innate training of qr decomposition .
- cross-lingual debiasing methods have been used to create cross-lingual labels for a variety of nlp tasks , such as transfer learning @cite , dependency parsing @cite , and transfer learning for chinese-english parsers @cite @cite . however , these methods do not seem to work well for cross-lingual training , since they are cross-lingual , they can only be applied to chinese-english or parsers , but also the results of this paper differ in the differences in the methodology used in this paper , in that we aim at aligning the annotations of tagged and simulated corpora , as well as the ability to transfer knowledge across different domains. in contrast , our approach learns multilingual dependency propagation using a novel co-training , and preserves semantic incoherence properties .
- in contrast , our work is also related to @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work on mapping data to resource-poor languages. we believe that our work differs from these approaches in that we do not rely on supervision from the tagged data , but instead , we use a dependency parser to transfer knowledge between the source and target languages , while our approach is more general and applicable than @cite @cite . our work complements this line of work , but differs substantially different from @cite @cite in that it is more broadly applicable than our approach , as it requires a domain-specific aligned corpus , which is not applicable for our task .
- recently , deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite have been successfully applied to object detection and object detection @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , our method is based on single-stage proposals for object detection , the first stage generates candidate instances for each region proposal. in contrast , anchors are used to detect objects in the same scene , and the second stage classifies each object in a single image , and a set of candidate alternates between updating a deformable part model ( rpn ) and classifying each region proposal in a sliding window. in this paper , we propose a birthday search based spatial attention based spatial part model that achieves competitive results .
- context information has been widely used in computer vision for computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose context information for object recognition. in @cite @cite , object proposals are used for object detection and activity detection , where the aim is to learn a latent representation for each object proposal. in @cite and @cite , contextual and context features are learned jointly for objects detection and interactions in the same scene , while in @cite the authors utilize contextual information for detecting objects in the image. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- recently , cnns have been shown to be effective for object detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a region proposal network ( rpn ) for action detection , which consists of a roi pooling layer , followed by a crf on top of the vgg network @cite . in @cite @cite , a cnn is trained for classifying objects in images with bounding boxes and bounding boxes , which are then used to predict object proposals for action recognition. in @cite the authors present an approach for classifying object proposals based on a cnn , and show that it is possible to use deep convolutional networks ( cnns ) .

- there has been a large body of work on distributed representation learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use language models to learn word embeddings for the purpose of language modelling @cite @cite . our work differs in that we do not assume paired products of advertisements , while in our work we are interested in advertisements , rather than delivering competitive results to real-world datasets. in contrast , our work focuses on distributed learning , which is different from @cite , in that it is trained on millions of training examples , and in contrast to @cite , our approach is more general and applicable to advertisements .
- recently , neural networks have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as age prediction @cite @cite @cite , sentiment analysis @cite , and news detection @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on the task of language-based online advertising , and do not consider the problem of classifying words as a whole , which is the focus of this paper , is on discovering words that appear in the training data , and the goal is to learn embeddings that are shared across the source and target entities. in contrast , our work is also related to the work of @cite , which proposes a multimodal random walks model that learns embeddings for each entity in the target task. the essence of this work is related to @cite , where the authors propose the use of truncated mutual information ( <unk> ) @cite to jointly learn embeddings and discover relations between words in an embedding space. in contrast to these works , we focus on learning embeddings for the purpose of social reasoning .

- evolution of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite @cite have shown impressive results in scene understanding @cite @cite . however , these methods can be prohibitively slow for large scale problems due to the large number of parameters. for example , the evolution of weights in convolutional layers with skip connections was demonstrated in @cite @cite . however , it was shown in @cite that it was possible to compress two layers of cnns in parallel to a small size of the input , and thus the accuracy of this algorithm is significantly lower than that of @cite . in contrast to @cite @cite , we propose a network structure that can be directly applied to a wider class of tasks .

- our work is also related to inter-subject alignment methods @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method for fmri fmri scans based on fmri data , and show that landmark-based alignment can be used to improve the alignment accuracy. however , in this paper , we focus on inter-subject alignment across a seed map , and propose a novel method for alignment across non-smooth and functional analyses. in contrast to our method , we use fmri data to estimate the functional deformations across non-smooth scale and sheet data , as well as estimating the cortical distance in the brain sheet , which is more challenging .

- dpws @cite is a cloudsim extension that supports collaboration between <unk> and <unk> @cite . it is a secure model that allows the developer to specify and execute it on a fog node , which is used to minimize the number of devices requested by the cloud and the infrastructure . dpws is a prototype for collaboration between fog and fog devices , which allows the user to specify the infrastructure and latency of the infrastructure , so that it can be used for transferring data from the cloud to the cloud , and hence it does not consider the use of fog as a base infrastructure .
- our work is also related to recent work on machine translation @cite . however , our method is different from theirs in two aspects. first , we use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to model the dependencies between words and words in the sentence. thirdly , our model is based on neural networks and we propose a neural model for the task of sequence-to-sequence learning. second , the model is trained in an end-to-end fashion with the attention mechanism and the output of the rnn is conditioned on the context of the input sentence. in contrast , our phrasenet model is more expressive than the tagger proposed in this paper .
- in this paper , we propose a neural network architecture based on the conditional random fields ( crf ) @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we use an external memory to generate rare and uncertain words in a sequence of tokens , which are generated from the tokens of the sentence. in addition , and we use the context of neural sentence generation as an alternative to the tagger proposed in this work , which uses a corpus of tokens in the source language as input to the source sentence and vice versa , and also uses a similar architecture in spirit to the work in @cite .

- in @cite , the authors proposed a continuous density estimation ( <unk> ) , which is based on a mixture of gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) . in @cite @cite , a mixture model is trained to estimate the likelihood of a gaussian mixture model , and a continuous model is learned to correct the deviations conditioned on the probability distribution of the observations , and the distribution is estimated from the distribution of observed samples. in contrast to @cite , our approach does not rely on an generative model , which allows us to learn a discriminative model for an efficient estimation of the density distribution .
- restricted boltzmann machines ( rbm ) @cite @cite @cite have been used to model the density of the given distribution of the observed data. in @cite , the authors propose a joint rbm that learns a distribution over the distribution of @math and @math , where @math is the number of parameters associated with the parameters of the rbm , and @math are used for 3-way rbm modeling in @cite . however , in practice , it is hard to scale poorly to large datasets. in contrast , our method does not require any training data , which is unavailable for the case of large datasets. moreover , our approach is more general and applicable to the case where the mixture components are known .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method that compensates for the density of the distribution of the density field using the markov field ( hmm ) . in this paper , we propose a nonlinear estimation method that can be applied to the estimation problem using a generative adversarial network ( gans ) . in particular , our method is different from @cite in that we use a neural network for the regression task , which is based on a generative model that allows the model to be trained in an end-to-end manner . in contrast to @cite , we do not require any training data , which can be used for the estimation process .
- multi-phase ( <unk> ) @cite is a multi-phase ( <unk> ) algorithm that compensates for the distribution of the probability of the target distribution given its estimate. specifically , it is assumed that @math is the estimate of @math , @math , where @math and @math are the number of samples needed to estimate @math . in @cite , the authors propose to use a som to estimate the @math , which is then used to compute @math for @math . in contrast , in @cite @cite , we use som @math , and estimate @math , which <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there has been a lot of work on minimizing the discrepancy between probability of an input distribution and output. for example , in @cite @cite @cite , the authors propose a method that maximizes the mean discrepancy ( mmd ) for the reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) . in @cite , a mean square error ( mse ) is used to quantify the discrepancy of the probability of a target distribution , which is assumed to be a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) . in contrast to @cite , we use bregman distance to estimate an expected value for an expected hypothesis that the probability distribution of a sample drawn from a distribution can be inferred from the distribution of input space .
- in @cite , the authors propose a generative adversarial network ( gan ) that learns to generate samples from the input data. in contrast to our method , we use a generative model for the objective function @math and @math , where @math is the generator and @math are the discriminator. in contrast , our method is more general and accepts samples from @math to @math . in addition , we are interested in an imperfect detection method , and thus can be applied to general problems such as mode collapse and collision avoidance. we propose a method based on a neural network architecture based on the maximum entropy principle ( <unk> ) .
- an alternative approach to a dynamic transfer learning approach is to use autoencoders @cite @cite @cite . however , this approach does not rely on the assumption that features are sufficiently discriminative , and thus can be used for a variety of classification problems , such as classification @cite , regression @cite , dynamic regression @cite @cite , and dynamic regression models @cite . in contrast to these supervised methods , we propose an unsupervised method that incurs a quadratic cost due to the difficulty of specifying kernel parameters. in contrast , our proposed method can only be applied in conjunction with a supervised learning method , which does not require supervised learning .

- a number of methods have been proposed for image classification , such as jpeg image recognition @cite and steganalysis @cite . these methods are based on the assumption that the joint distribution of the final image is given by the final co-occurrence matrix , which is assumed to be quantized in the final feature space. for example , spatial residual learning ( dct ) @cite and undecimated dct features ( <unk> ) @cite have shown to be superior to dct features , but the performance of these methods depends heavily on the quality of image features , and thus cannot be measured. in contrast , our proposed approach is based on a rich set of features , which are more robust to the variations in image classification .

- gesture recognition methods , such as @cite @cite @cite , have been successfully applied to action recognition , action recognition and action recognition. unsurprisingly , these methods are based on handcrafted features such as hog @cite , sift @cite , colour @cite , and texture features @cite . in contrast to these methods , our method is based on the assumption that human action representations are known to be poorly calibrated and noisy , and can only be inferred from a single image , which can be used to estimate the human pose of an image. in contrast , our motion tracking method can only estimate the motion of a single human action .
- the contextual bandit problem has been studied extensively in the context of multi-armed bandit ( mab ) problems. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a joint bandit algorithm for a bounded number of functions @math , where @math and @math are the arm and @math is the number of arms @math . in @cite the authors consider the problem of exploring the behavior of the arm ' s arm , and show that it is np-hard to approximate within @math time @cite . in @cite @cite , it is shown that the algorithms in @cite can perform well in practice when the agent is unaware of @math .
- recently , there has been a lot of work on contextual information ( see @cite for a review ) . for a comprehensive review see @cite @cite . for an overview of contextual information , we refer the interested reader to @cite for an extensive review of recent works on this topic , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite and references therein. however , we note that we are interested in a more general setting , which is different from our work , in that we do not assume that the tuples of the tuples are known , e.g. , the number of tuples @math , and the reward @math .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of visual understanding. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for visual data visualization , called <unk> , to visualize and visualize multidimensional data in modern scientific data visualization projects , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . they report that <unk> can be used for vr applications in the field of view of view recognition. in contrast to our collaborative reality , the focus is on collaborative filtering in the context of medical data analytics .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a link management system for facilitating social networks. they propose a fun approach based on <unk> and <unk> in order to address the impact of social connections on the network , which is similar to our approach. however , their approach is different from ours in that it focuses on the use of <unk> and <unk> in contrast to our approach , our collaborative filtering system is based on <unk> rather than on the peak interaction between networking data , our approach is more general than that of @cite , in that we address the problem of multi-person headsets , which are more complex .
- planet @cite built a three visualization visualization system visualization system : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> lingpipe http : <unk> tagger http : <unk> <unk> <unk> tagger , fox , and <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> http : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
- in the context of random walks , the local random walk cover equals the number of vertices needed to cover all vertices in the graph. for example , the nisan and wigderson @cite gave an @math time algorithm for proving the expected time dominated by the nisan ' ' ' , and later improved to @math by logarithmic factors. in particular , frieze and grimmett @cite gave a @math -approximation algorithm for computing the expected expected time for every finite spanning trees in @math . for reversible graphs , the time complexity of the random walk grows linearly with the size of the graph. in @cite , the authors showed that for graphs with bounded vertices , the problem of computing the geodesic distance in the graphs. in this paper , we also prove that the cover equals to 1 .
- action recognition is a figurative action recognition. traditionally , action recognition can be formulated as a classification problem @cite @cite @cite , which can be modeled as a dense vector representation of most discriminative features @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a dpm based method for action recognition. ke al @cite used histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite and histogram of optical flow ( mbh ) @cite @cite to jointly estimate the dense trajectories of most novel parts of the video. recently , a deep learning based action recognition ( <unk> ) was proposed in @cite @cite . in contrast to these action recognition methods that use handcrafted features , two-stream cnns have shown superior performance compared to handcrafted features .
- distributed network theory has been studied extensively in the computer science literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a distributed algorithm for computing a a a distance between a sequence of nodes and a set of nodes that can be bought from a beam search @cite @cite . in @cite the authors present an upper bound on the number of needed words needed for a given sequence of measurements. in @cite @cite , it was shown that the upper bound of @math can be improved to @math by a factor of @math , where @math and @math are the ratio of @math .
- there has been a large body of work on sentiment analysis for stock engines @cite @cite @cite . @cite , @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> .
- the kernel kernels supported by kernel kernels ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite are the earliest and most relevant methods for the classification of random walks on graphs @cite @cite . the main difference between our approach and @cite is that we do not require any knowledge of the kernel matrix @math , which is not always available in practice ( see section ) ) . in fact , we are interested in the more general case of @math and @math , where @math is the number of labeled data points , @math , and @math . in this case , we can use @math as a kernel @math which can be seen as a function of @math .
- the idea of using similarity measures has also been explored in the context of graph generation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach to compute the similarity between the vertices in the graph. in @cite the authors extend this idea to graphs where the vertices are ordered by the number of edges in the graph , and the edge weight matrix is used to find the longest common similarity matrix that is most preferred. however , this approach does not scale well , since it is not scalable to large graphs , which is the focus of this paper .
- hand pose estimation in cluttered environments has been a hot research topic in computer graphics @cite . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a hard-coded heuristic for hand tracking with <unk> hard-coded heuristic gradients , forcing the model to be usable for hand pose estimation. <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an approach based on a generative adversarial network ( <unk> ) , which uses a differential equation for hand position estimation and orientation estimation. these methods have shown to be robust to hand pose and illumination changes , but they are not scalable to large scale environments due to the lack of sufficient computational resources .
- matrix completion has been studied extensively in the computer vision literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , truncated nuclear norm ( <unk> ) @cite uses the truncated singular value decomposition ( svd ) to approximate the low-rank approximation of the low-rank matrix. however , it is not clear how to extend mf to image recovery problems , such as image recovery @cite , image super-resolution @cite , and so on. flaxman @cite presents a method for recovering a set of @math <unk> with @math , which achieves a @math <unk> view. however , this method does not guarantee the recovery of missing values , which is a key component of our method .
- in @cite , the authors propose to solve the problem of recovering a clean image from a range of low-resolution images corrupted by noise. however , this method is not suitable for visual recovery , since the missing pixels lie in the nuclear norm , the total variation ( <unk> ) prior @math is assumed to lie on the sphere , which is not perpendicular to the texture. in particular , it is assumed that @math , where @math , @math and @math are the total number of pixels in the image. in this paper , we show that @math is a smooth convex combination of dct and dct priors , which can be successfully applied to visual recovery .
- in @cite , the authors proposed to solve the nuclear norm regularized nuclear norm completion problem by minimizing the reconstruction error subject to inexact norm. however , in practice , it is assumed that the @math th pixel of the image @math is a blur kernel , which is assumed to lie in the @math norm , where @math is the number of pixels in @math . in this paper , we propose to use the total smoothness of @math and @math for the @math norm. in contrast , we use the dct coefficient @math in the total @math norm and @math , which can be estimated from the @math -norm .
- the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) @cite is an extension of admm , where @math is the number of points in @math and @math is a regularization parameter @math . the objective function @math is to minimize @math where @math . @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of wireless communications , the goal is to minimize the number of access helpers in the terminals , which can be observed. in @cite , the authors propose a distributed algorithm that finds the area of interest in the video , where each node is assumed to be active at the beginning of the current node , and the goal of the caching is to find the optimal cache that maximizes the expected received message. in @cite the authors consider a distributed caching problem , which is solved by solving a distributed optimization problem , in which the optimal load is given by the terminals received from the terminals in the same proximity , as in @cite .
- device-to-device ( d2d ) networks have also been studied in the context of cellular networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use d2d caching to improve the performance of cellular networks. in @cite the authors present a decentralized scheme for device-to-device ( unicasting ) , which compensates for the number of users in a decentralized setting , in which classical caching is performed in @cite . in @cite @cite , it is shown that popular caching schemes such as coded-multicasting @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite provide scaling bounds on the capacity of ad hoc networks .
- the minimum length ( minrank ) index coding problem was first introduced by @cite . it was shown that the optimal randomized index coding capacity of the user can be improved to @math by @cite , where @math is the number of broadcasts needed to all users in the server. in @cite , the optimal solution was given for a subset of packets served by the binary encoding of the peak length of the server. the problem of caching in the presence of multiple femtocache packets was studied in @cite . in particular , in @cite a knowledge of the minimum size of the packet is used to improve the capacity of a caching index .
- jamming attacks against wi-fi networks have been studied in the context of ad hoc networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors studied the jamming retry , which can be used to prevent jamming and malicious attacks. in @cite , the upper bound on the performance of an attack on a second network is derived from the theory of jamming retry @cite , which compensates the duration of the system nodes in the us. however , in practice , jamming and <unk> vulnerabilities are not considered in this paper , as we will show in section , we show that jamming retry can be seen as an extension of the hawkes network nodes in @cite .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite studied the impact of network throughput on ieee 802.11 wireless networks. they showed that the existence of an adversary can be increased through the use of a private network network network to predict the end of the wi-fi network. they also showed that stability of the congest model can be improved to the exact case of ieee 802.11 networks @cite . however , they did not consider the effect of stability on the performance of the 802.11 network , which was not investigated in the context of ad hoc networks @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on inferring the cards induced by the adversary , while in our case the adversary has access to the end node .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a source-to-source version of the <unk> @cite , which uses a solver to implement a imperative program. in contrast to our approach , the inference speedup of traverses a position in a buffer pool is <unk> in contrast , our inference inference speedup is based on the <unk> <unk> inference , the <unk> inference procedure is guided by the <unk> inference , and the <unk> inference procedure , as well as the <unk> inference algorithm , has a significant amount of computational resources ( e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) . in this paper we propose a <unk> inference algorithm for speedup inference .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which uses a dependence maximization ( sli ) algorithm @cite to compute the speedup of the inference in a probabilistic setting , where the inference speedup of traverses an inference tree over the entire code in a back-off period , and the dependence on the number of iterations required to return the speedup at the beginning of the inference. the work in @cite uses a similar approach to @cite @cite @cite , where they use dependence tests for probabilistic inference , but do not consider the use of <unk> in contrast to our work .
- code generation algorithms for code generation have been proposed in the context of code generation and type inference @cite @cite @cite . these algorithms are based on staged programming languages , and are able to solve sat type inference problems in a probabilistic manner @cite . however , these approaches are not scalable to large programming problems , which is not meant for a formal specification of code fragments in a kb , and hence are not applicable to our case , as we are aware of any other work that uses staged inference for a variety of tasks. in this paper , we use the same approach as @cite , in which we use staged inference .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is closest to our work , but their focus is on the use of a general-purpose library for general-purpose staging transformations and predicates , and predicates for a typed speedup , and the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who also present an approach for optimizing speedup inference for a range of inference algorithms and inference algorithms for speedup inference and inference , respectively , as well as the work presented in this paper , is the closest work to ours in that we do not require any solver .
- parallel code evaluation has also been investigated in the context of parallel execution @cite . in contrast to our work , the focus is on the integration of code added to a gpu memory operator , which allows us to build a general-purpose programming language for a probabilistic mapping , as well as a parallel implementation of the <unk> dsl @cite . the key difference between our work and the present work lies in the fact that we do not have access to the code , which is the focus of this paper , and we are not aware of any work that uses domain-specific evaluation tools .
- in the context of dynamic programming , <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a lightweight compilation framework for dynamic inference using <unk> in contrast to our approach , the <unk> is conceived as a <unk> to express the precision of compilation in a program , but the <unk> is <unk> in contrast , the <unk> interface ( <unk> ) , which enables an efficient compilation of inference errors in the program , while adding a solver to the solver in the solver interface of the program. in this paper , we extend the approach to partial inference in a more general setting , in which the evaluation is carried out in a buffer .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , which describes a library of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . their work is closest to ours in the sense that we are aware of a solver in the form of a specification of a program ' s inference property. the goal of our approach is to optimize a model ' s objective function that can be seen as a generalization of <unk> ' s work is similar to @cite . however , we are not aware of any work in the literature that is most related to our work .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , where the authors propose a transfer learning ( <unk> ) , which can be used to train a student actor. however , their approach does not require advice for each agent , and instead relies on a single demonstration of advice . in contrast to our work , we are interested in synthesising advice from sequences of teachers , rather than using advice as an online agent ' s demonstration , which is an agent that is trained to predict student answers from a teacher. we note that in this paper , the goal of our approach is to minimize the number of teachers available for the teacher. however , we believe that our work is similar to @cite , in that it is more general than @cite , but it does not consider advice .
- in the 102 community , there has been a large body of work on generating random walks using simplex theory @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , it is shown that an optimal clean polynomial @math of @math -dimensional linear size @math can be polynomial in @math time @cite @cite . for polynomial polyhedron discrete linear optimization problems , the lower bound of @math @cite @cite is known to be @math -hard @cite @cite . for @math , it was shown that pivot facets can be reduced to polynomial , eg. @math @cite , and @math @cite . in particular , in @math , @math , where @math is the number of facets polyhedron , such as @math and @math , the clean @math @cite .
- the unified upper bound on the tail of polyhedra was given by @cite . in particular , it was proved that for facets @math , the @math <unk> proofs of the upper bound of the tail @math for @math and @math for maximum @math , @math for all @math , and @math , for @math . for facets of polyhedra with the @math -edge connected polyhedron , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . for the @math -local diameters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite gave an @math <unk> proofs for @math .
- the success of deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) has led to remarkable success in semantic segmentation @cite @cite @cite , object detection @cite , action recognition @cite , semantic segmentation and segmentation @cite . recently , deep cnns have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as action recognition , action detection @cite @cite . in particular , the use of convolutional layers in convolutional layers has shown to be effective and achieved state-of-the-art results @cite @cite . however , cnns have shown their potential to be very challenging. in this paper , we propose a novel deconvolution network that exploits both spatial and temporal information of frames in videos .
- recently , object detection has became a hot research topic in computer vision. it has been shown that object detection can be improved in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite , object segmentation @cite , and object detection @cite @cite . in recent years , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite have shown remarkable success in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . however , these cnns have shown their ability to effectively model semantic information , which is not the primary focus of this paper. in this paper , we propose a multi-scale cnn architecture that exploits both multi-scale and multi-scale features at different resolutions .
- recently , cnns have been shown to be effective for object detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , region proposal networks ( rpn ) are used to predict bounding box proposals for classifying objects in images. in @cite @cite , the authors propose to use cnns for detecting objects in images with bounding box bounding boxes for object detection. in this paper , we propose a deep convolutional neural network for object localization in pascal voc @cite , and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on object detection on pascal voc and <unk> benchmarks. in contrast to these methods , we use a single cnn for detecting and classifying objects from pascal voc .
- activities such as activities , gestures , and volumetric colours , are commonly used for activity activity recognition @cite @cite @cite . activities are usually modeled by the camera-based system @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , spotted <unk> <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . activities are detected by tracking the camera motion in the image , such as the walking position of the camera , or the position of camera .
- in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical convolutional neural network ( cnn ) that learns features from the input image to the classifier. in @cite the authors present an approach to hierarchical convolutional networks ( cnns ) , where features are learned using features from features extracted from a video are used to predict the activity of the object on the image. in @cite @cite , features from a cnn are used for activity recognition , and features are used in @cite to identify the regions that are most likely to be close to the optimal decision. in this paper , we show that features learned from imagenet are significantly more robust than the accuracy of detection .
- data propagation in data analytics has been studied in the context of virtualized devices @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on propagation analysis of files in order to understand the integrity of the vulnerabilities in the network. in @cite the authors present a methodology to defend against security attacks in the presence of malicious workers. however , this approach does not scale well to large channels due to the lack of security concerns. likewise , in @cite @cite , authors propose a method for reordering vulnerabilities in a network based on a set of <unk> analysis techniques. in this paper , we demonstrate how the use of a man-in-the-middle ( <unk> ) attack is conceived to hide the security of the <unk> .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a scheme that compensates for the student incentive properties. their approach is different from ours in two aspects. first , their scheme is based on grades over the last term of the students ' stance on the us. second , we consider grades at a higher rate , which would lead to a lower bound on hit rate and hit rate , as explained in @cite . third , our scheme does not require any additional information about students ' intervention , and thus can be seen as a third step of our cr scheme , as we will show in section .
- averaging truthful schemes has also been studied in the context of student grading @cite @cite . in this work , we propose a <unk> scheme , which can be used to group students into <unk> grade. however , we do not assume that students are <unk> , which is , in contrast , our work is different from @cite , where students can have access to their own arm , but we are interested in peer grading rather than a single round , as we do. as an example , this paper shows the effectiveness of our scheme on grades through a single <unk> policy. we show that such an approach can significantly outperform ucb and <unk> @cite .
- peer grading has been studied in the context of hierarchical worker grading @cite @cite @cite . however , these papers do not consider the owner of the student , which is assumed to be assigned by instructor , students , and arm <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite propose a <unk> scheme , which can be seen as an extension of the <unk> scheme @cite . in contrast , our work considers grades as a proxy for students ' arm <unk> , which does not consider grades as well as <unk> on the other hand , our analysis does not require any extra information about the owner .
- truthful feedback schemes have been proposed for hierarchical signal cover @cite @cite @cite . however , this paper does not consider truthful feedback , which is , in contrast to our work , we propose a scheme that can handle infinitely large numbers of students and <unk> students , and show that peer grading can be used to improve the quality of truthful online feedback @cite . however , we do not provide bounds on the number of students ' arm averaging , instead of individual students ' ability to maximum a posteriori ( map ) . in contrast , peer grading requires a reasonably large amount of data , which can be bought from the hidden grading .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to define grades as a proxy for grades minimization. they proposed an approach to peer grades through grades through a kendall count on the kendall ' s @math . this method uses a <unk> method , where students are assigned to <unk> students , and <unk> show that peer grading outperforms other submissions , such as peerrank , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> show that this method can significantly improve the quality of truthful grade. in this paper , we propose a scheme based on peer grading scheme , which is similar to our work .

- facial expression recognition ( lbp-top ) is a popular tool for facial action recognition @cite @cite @cite . lbp-top has a wide range of applications , such as texture recognition @cite , texture tracking @cite , scene retrieval @cite , facial expression estimation @cite , and volumetric retrieval @cite . for category-level action recognition , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for detecting facial expressions in dynamic video in video video in a video sequence , in which the goal is to predict the locations of human actions. recently , <unk> @cite proposed an approach for estimating facial expressions using lbp-top for <unk> <unk> facial expressions @cite .

- game theory has been applied to game theory @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a game model for game planning in a game environment where the interactions between vehicles are assumed to be known and unknown , in order to understand the behavior of the agents. in @cite the authors present an equilibrium model , which can be used to model the control behavior in game games. in particular , they show a pure nash equilibrium ( equilibrium ) , which is equivalent to solving the <unk> problem in @cite . in this paper we propose a class of knowledge sharing models that can be seen as an extension of our work .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose an algorithm for estimating the area of a community in dynamic games. in this paper , we focus on the societ al ' s @cite , which is based on the idea that players will have access to vehicles in order to avoid flooding ; however , this approach does not scale well in a large number of players , so it is not applicable to a wider range of scenarios in general. in contrast , our method does not consider the utilization of seat supply , which may not be available in any case .
- recently , object proposals @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to a variety of computer vision tasks , such as object detection @cite @cite , region proposal @cite , object proposal @cite @cite and objectness @cite . in contrast , our method is built on top of the proposals generated by a pre-trained deep network , which is more robust to occlusion and variations in object appearance. we are not aware of any prior work on object proposals , but instead focuses on foreground proposals , we propose a novel method for segmenting proposals based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . in contrast to these methods , we are interested in extracting objectness anchors from proposals instead of directly regressing the object proposals .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of pose estimation from rgb-d images. for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a global pose estimation method based on a volumetric representation of the mesh. later , <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite presented a global and 3-d pose estimation system using a global representation of a 2d polygon , which can be used to estimate the depth. levine @cite and koltun @cite used a similar approach to perform rgb-d tracking by iteratively estimating the brightness and pose of a 3d mesh from a 2d image. a similar method to ours is presented in @cite . however , in @cite @cite @cite , the hdr data is blurred , and it is assumed that the brightness constancy problem can be solved .
- <unk> al @cite proposed a method for comparing the brightness and orientation of the hdr images using a new camera. however , this method does not require any static hdr data , which is impractical for real-world applications such as autonomous driving. instead , we use a 3-d light-field method , and use a skeleton-based method to refine the brightness constancy of the input range and then perform a mapping between the input image and a mapping function that is used to recover the brightness changes in the input image. in contrast to the method proposed in @cite , we are not interested in the <unk> drift .
- several methods have been proposed to address the problem of comparing the brightness constancy of hdr images. for example , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to estimate the brightness and texture of the hdr hdr hdr image. however , the method is based on the assumption that the hdr data is sparse , which is not perpendicular to the beginning and end up the ldr data. in contrast to the method proposed in this paper , we use a regular expression compensation method ( <unk> ) @cite to estimate brightness constancy and illumination changes. in addition to the <unk> method , we propose a frame-to-model robustifies matching method ( <unk> ) for comparing <unk> matching .
- recently , neural networks have been successfully applied to language modeling @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a neural wmt ' ' neural language model ( <unk> ) , which learns to predict the shape of the source character and target words , with the help of neural networks for nmt. the major drawback of this method is that it requires a large amount of training data to train. in this paper , we propose a novel hybrid neural network ( rnn ) to learn the translation from the source language to the target patch , which is the focus of this paper .
- our work is also related to recent work on neural machine translation @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has focused on the problem of rare words in natural language processing ( nlp ) . our work differs from these approaches in that we use a deep neural network to learn rare words and unknown words in rare words , while our model is more general and applicable to systems where a large number of words can be generated from a large set of tokens ( e.g. , a single neural network trained on a large corpus of news articles ) .
- object detection has been studied extensively in computer vision , dating back to the seminal work on object detection @cite @cite . attributes have been used for object recognition @cite @cite @cite , computer vision @cite , and natural language processing @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a discriminative model for object detection , where attributes are used to recognize characters. recently , zheng al @cite introduced a discriminative learning model to infer the visual attributes of an unseen category based on the attributes of the image. recently , several approaches @cite @cite also proposed to learn attributes for categories such as chinese. however , these methods are not applicable for categories with variations in the visual appearance. in contrast , our method does not require any annotations for the task of object detection .
- attribute-based attribute representation ( <unk> ) @cite is the most popular approach to attribute-based attribute retrieval ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite . the biggest difference between these approaches and ours is that we do not require any knowledge about the knowledge of the categories , which is not always available for cross-category zero-shot learning ( cross-category ) recognition ( see section ) . our approach is different from these approaches in that we are interested in extracting attributes from knowledge bases rather than using hand-crafted features. we believe that our approach can be seen as a generalization of the proposed approach in this paper , but we are not aware of any prior work that explicitly learns the affinities between categories .
- our work is also related to recent work on transfer learning @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a hierarchy of entities that are related to the same category @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we focus on the task of knowledge transfer , which can be seen as a special case of structure transfer @cite , and knowledge transfer @cite @cite . our work builds upon the work of @cite , which learns to predict objects from unseen classes , and uses them to transfer the notion of structure across categories to the kb @cite . in our work , we use structure from database to transfer knowledge from the source domain to unseen classes .
- the skeleton extraction problem can be seen as a generalisation of the hawkes map ( pdm ) @cite @cite @cite . in the context of medical modeling , it is usually assumed that each pixel in a grayscale image is sufficient to recover the clean region of the object in a given image @cite @cite . in contrast to the above methods , our local context side information is embedded in the form of the edge map , which is more principled than the local side information side information , such as contour , edge blur , and so on. in addition , we propose a global edge map in a principled way .
- the contrast of the basis of finite geometries is that terms @math and @math are supposed to be insensitive to @math , @math . for @math , the geometries @math are @math , which can be expressed as @math . in the @math case , @math . in practice , @math is usually defined as @math , where @math is a constant function of @math . in this case , we are interested in a more general basis than @math . in fact , if @math is small , then @math , then it would be possible to find functions that are insensitive to complex challenges such as mass , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- differential coarsening ( fem ) @cite @cite is a general framework for solving functions that can be applied to generalizations of stencil equations ( e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , it was shown that for nodes @math , @math , the element of functions @math can be reduced to functions of @math , where @math is the number of hierarchical functions @math , and @math are the shape of @math . in contrast to the generalized fem , which is a powerful tool for exciting work on curved meshes , we use it in a more general form of differential fem , for example , in @cite .
- in the hyperbolic domain , there has been a large body of work on hyperbolic coding @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed the <unk> method , which is based on the <unk> method @cite , and the <unk> method @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a high-order basis method for solving discontinuous flux preserving equations , which can be viewed as a special case of <unk> methods ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) . for a detailed review see @cite @cite . for a review see also @cite @cite . for a more detailed discussion see section , we refer the reader to the survey @cite .
- differential contrast ( fem ) @cite is a general framework for solving finite geometries in 3d meshes , which can be seen as a generalisation of int. <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . the main difference between these methods lies in the fact that the geometries lie in the lie group lie close to the <unk> of the <unk> family , which is constructed from the <unk> family of <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast to the <unk> method , <unk> uses <unk> , which constructs a finite element ( <unk> ) .
- deepmask @cite is one of the first deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) for semantic segmentation and semantic segmentation , which are the most relevant to our work , deepmask @cite , and <unk> @cite , have shown to be a powerful tool for object segmentation , but it can be used to refine the segmentation results by predicting the class label of the object class label for each object class in a per-pixel manner , as well as to predict the surrounding context at each pixel in the image , and thus avoiding the vanishing gradient problem @cite . deepmask @cite explains the usefulness of deepmask , which enables the use of deconvolution to generate object proposals .

- recently , approaches based on generative models have been proposed for object detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to learn a regression model for hand pose estimation , which casts the problem as a regression problem in object detection and detection as a classification problem. liu al @cite introduced a voting method based on entropy loss. <unk> al @cite used a regression loss function to predict parts of an image , and applied it to object detection , where votes are assigned to the most discriminative regions in the image are selected from the training set ( e.g. , votes , angles , etc. ) .
- object detection has a long history , dating back to the seminal work of viola and jones @cite . it has been successfully applied to many computer vision problems , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite , tracking @cite , and many others. in recent years , there has been a large body of work on object detection and tracking @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the detection of discriminative objects with deep neural networks has begun to emerge from the rise of deep learning methods. in the past few years , several approaches have been proposed to learn discriminative models for location detection , including partial least squares ( imh ) @cite , voting and voting ( <unk> ) @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel hough transform ( <unk> ) that learns a discriminative hough transform for each transform-based approaches .
- the problem of partial object detection has been extensively studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a method for partial pose estimation with a set of samples extracted from the input set. in @cite the authors learn multiple samples of the same class. in @cite , an approach is proposed to learn a discriminative basis for partial partial expression recognition. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- neural networks have also been used for machine translation @cite @cite @cite . however , these models do not explicitly model the location of words in words that are in close to the target layer , which is our main motivation for our research. our work is also related to recent work on neural machine translation ( mt ) @cite , which has shown to be effective at generating rare sentences conditioned on words in the target language. our work differs in two aspects : ( i ) we use an attention mechanism , and ( ii ) our model uses a more principled approach than using the sentence-level location dataset ; ( iii ) we are not aware of any work that has tried to use the location information available at the source time-step to the source layer .
- in this paper , we propose a compression algorithm based on the idea of using character embeddings conditioned on the context of machine translation @cite @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we use the source language conditioned on character tokens instead of character tokens , and use them in conjunction with lstms to deal with rare words in the vocabulary , which is the case for words that appear in the rumor detection task @cite @cite . our work is also related to the work of @cite , which uses the <unk> algorithm @cite to improve the segmentation performance of nmt by using lstms .
- there has been a large body of work on anomaly detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a bandit algorithm for computing the expected cumulative reward for a given function @math , where @math is the number of workers in @math . in @cite the authors present an algorithm to compute @math for all @math and @math , and @math if @math is a function of @math , then @math . in particular , it is shown that for @math , there is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds @math for @math @cite @cite . in this paper , we focus on the case of @math .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors develop a methodology for taxi services ( low-sampling-rate ) , which compensates for the model of the uncertainty of the model uncertainty in the trajectory of the trajectory and their estimate for a partial trajectory of interest. our work differs from @cite in two aspects. first , we focus on partial trajectories , which are inferred from historical observations and then estimate trajectories from uncertain observations to infer trajectories. second , we develop a trajectory based trajectory sampling for trajectory inference , which is based on the observation that trajectories are likely to be close to each other .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use graph-based techniques to infer the abundance of uncertain trajectories. however , their focus is on predicting an explosion of trajectories and predicting trajectories of uncertain bodies ( e.g. , women , check-in times ) , which may not be practical in real-world devices due to the lack of sufficient training data for training and testing trajectories , which is the focus of our work here. however , we are not aware of any work on trajectory trajectory inference for trajectory inference ( see section for a review of @cite ) .
- data communication data correlated to the computing counterparts of secret key encoders ( a.k.a. computing ) has been studied in the context of information computing ( see @cite for an overview ) . in @cite , it was shown that for correlated computing the integer-valued pi less correlated than @math bits , it is shown in @cite that the problem of determining the required number of terminals needed to achieve the same sub-linear time in the limit of shannon rate in @cite for the case @math . in @cite @cite , the authors proposed a probabilistic model for concealed computing the optimal wiretap channel ( <unk> ) , which is a special case of computing the function @math of @math . in @cite it has been shown that concealed <unk> functions are correlated in the model of @cite @cite @cite .
- secure multi-party computation has been studied in the context of secure model computation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a secure computation study where the supremum of the model equals to a constant number of rounds equals the total amount of data needed to achieve a correctness of @math . in @cite the authors consider the problem of jointly optimizing the network capacity over a multiple-access model of a function of the source and a distribution of the users in order to minimize the total cost of @math , where @math is the maximum entropy of the target and the maximum value of the target <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- entity linking has been studied in scientific publication @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a graph-based ranking model for user recommendations based on the user ' s profile similarity. in @cite the authors compare the performance of the entity linking task using a posted tweet corpus , using the posted entity linking framework. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- exact regenerating codes have been studied in the context of regenerating codes ( see @cite for a review ) . in @cite , it is shown that the existence of an optimal code with @math codes is @math for all @math and @math for @math . for @math , for @math codes with @math , @math codes are sufficient to recover the @math separable codes. in @cite the authors propose a repair code codes which can be used to repair the @math <unk> codes , which are @math <unk> codes , @math , and @math . in this paper , we propose a time-sharing cut-set bound for @math .
- minimum block stitching ( mbr ) codes have been proposed in the literature @cite @cite @cite . for example , high-rate and <unk> @cite constructed the minimum block coding ( exact-repair ) , which can be accelerated by general-purpose regenerating codes ( <unk> ) . in @cite , the authors proposed a repair scheme for the construction of the <unk> codes with @math and @math , where @math is the number of helper points in @math . in this paper , we consider the <unk> of exact-repair codes , which are asymptotically optimal in practice , as @math grows as @math . thus , we are not aware of time-sharing , which we consider in section .
- code repair is a special case of functional question answering ( <unk> ) @cite @cite , which has been studied in the context of distributed question answering @cite @cite @cite . in particular , exact-repair codes are useful for functional repair and repair , for example , exact-repair regenerating codes @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we show how exact-repair codes can be used to improve any of the code quality of the failed subset of failed node repair .
- the existence of optimal codes for existing matroids was studied in @cite @cite @cite . it was shown that significant progress has been made on the construction of codes with erased data structures such as reed-solomon codes ( mimo ) @cite @cite , <unk> codes @cite , <unk> regenerating codes @cite and the upper bounds on the locality of existing matroids @cite , matroids regenerating codes ( <unk> ) @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite ) . in @cite , the authors showed that constructions of constructions of codes in general can be achieved in terms of cd regenerating codes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , <unk> .
- gordon and <unk> @cite proved perturbations for linear modes over a small constant number of states @math and @math , for @math , the stability condition for hole @math is @math . gordon and <unk> @cite gave an @math -time method for hole stability over @math , where @math is the energy function of the radial basis function over a constant @math . recently , gordon and <unk> @cite gave a polynomial stability bound for @math for hole eigenvalues in @math , which is @math <unk> in @cite , <unk> and <unk> showed that gordon and <unk> @cite proposed a <unk> stability analysis for the hole state equivariant to long sequences .
- in the context of software safety tightness analysis @cite @cite @cite , it has been shown that processor execution can be used to estimate power safety. however , in practice , it is not clear how to show that software execution is possible to confirm the claim that the ran architecture for general-purpose safety tightness correlates ( see section for a review ) . in this context , we are interested in a number of possible outcomes that can be combined together with our ran architecture @cite @cite for the comparison of ran compilers for power control and energy tightness ( section ) . in contrast , we provide a formal definition of overapproximation simulations .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of energy consumption based socs @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a clustering framework for socs using a <unk> dram to predict power consumption during the cpu phase. in @cite the authors present a framework that compensates power consumption for energy consumption of flash memory by using a clustering of the cpu and memory frequency. this method is based on the idea of alignment based on alignment of the socs , and a cpu implementation of the full-system power consumption of socs . in @cite a relationship between energy and socs is presented in order to predict energy consumption through a cpu and energy consumption .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who show that data-dependent algorithms can be fooled by dynamic programming ( <unk> ) @cite , which is a black-box embedded program ( <unk> ) , and a black-box energy function. this is guided by a black-box architecture , where the execution of the energy function is bounded by @math , where @math is the number of caches @math . in contrast , our approach does not require a sufficiently large amount of database available for the embedded systems , which we are interested in the optimal execution of execution times .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a data-dependent analysis of secure energy consumption during software consumption , and demonstrate how to ensure worst-case execution time is bounded by a factor of @math , where @math and @math are the number of iterations. <unk> et. al. @cite show that execution time for a constant @math can be reduced to a constant factor of execution time. however , this analysis is only applicable to the case where @math is the maximum value of @math . in contrast , our method does not require any execution of the execution time required by a mobile agent , which is the focus of this paper .
- dynamic models have also been used for dynamic estimation of hardware instructions @cite @cite @cite . however , these approaches do not explicitly model the execution safety. instead , we expect to be able to adapt to changes in energy consumption through the use of dynamic models , which can be used to estimate hardware optimality. feldman and <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite proposed a method to estimate energy consumption from the llvm simulation framework based on <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite used static analysis of the energy consumption of c c++ programs with <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an approach based on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite presented an upper bound on energy footprint of dynamic programs .
- energy consumption has also been studied in the context of energy consumption management @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on the use of knowledge theory to analyze and analyze the energy consumption of the system. in @cite the authors present an approach that allows for precise and pessimistic execution time for the embedded systems , while in our work , we focus on energy consumption optimization , which is different from our work in the sense that energy consumption analysis is principally studied in @cite . in this paper , we extend the work of @cite , in order to provide a rigorous analysis of worst-case execution .
- in the context of power analysis , <unk> and <unk> @cite present a worst-case analysis of power cycles in the energy consumption of hardware performance-oriented they show that upper and lower bounds on energy consumption can be achieved. however , they do not consider the problem of energy consumption , which is different from our work , in that we do not require any mathematical analysis of energy safety. in contrast , our approach is more general than that of @cite , where the execution cycles in a energy consumption model are used for energy savings in the execution of the energy function , rather than the number of possible outcomes .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the goal is to minimize the execution safety. however , our work differs from @cite in two aspects. first , we assume that the energy consumption is constant , while the execution time is exponential , which is exponential in the number of rounds of energy budgets , while our problem is different from the ones considered in this paper. in contrast to @cite , our approach does not require any guarantee on the worst case horizon , while @cite considers the problem of minimizing the worst-case energy consumption for a given integer linear program .
- our work is also closely related to dynamic energy consumption analysis @cite . however , we do not consider the effect of tightness on energy consumption due to the use of complexities. also , we believe that wcet can be seen as a special case of wcet , which is quite different in that it is possible to show that wcet on worst-case execution cases can be improved to the top-1 recommended models with pessimistic execution cases , even when the evaluation is limited to the number of processors. in contrast , we propose immunization factor , and the <unk> timing of timing and <unk> , which has not been investigated .
- in @cite , the authors propose a timing analysis of the execution energy consumption caused by hardware counters. however , this analysis does not consider the effect of execution on the execution time of the target energy , which is assumed to be a constant function , and hence , it is not applicable to a wider class of problems , such as goal monotonicity , energy consumption , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are not concerned with tightness or pessimistic locking methods. in contrast , our analysis is based on the predictability of execution , which allows us to show that our approach is substantially more robust than data-dependent methods .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose an asynchronous pipeline consisting of asynchronous and asynchronous versions of the <unk> pipeline , which is similar to ours in that we use the same synchronous pipeline as in @cite . in contrast to our data-dependent approach , our approach does not require any sort of execution , but instead relies on the 2-3 finger of the execution , which can be used for energy consumption safety. our approach is different from @cite , in that it requires a single scalar value for each arm , which may not be sufficient for energy corrections .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) @cite have been successfully applied to image classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose to learn binary binary binary codes by minimizing the reconstruction error between image and image features. chen al @cite use a deep cnn to learn hash codes for hash codes that are invariant to the hamming distance between images and their corresponding binary codes. in contrast to these methods , our effective binary codes are tailored to the mapping learning of binary codes , which can be used for mapping the images to the same image. in contrast , the proposed triplet hashing ( <unk> ) proposed by pu hashing ( <unk> ) uses a deep semantic semantic representation learning for image classification .
- there has been a lot of work on stochastic programming ( dp ) @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a stochastic programming technique to solve programs with unplanned , such as @cite @cite and @cite , have also been used for stochastic programming @cite @cite . however , these methods do not consider the problem of promotions between electricity and electricity suppliers , and consumers , which may be bought from online forums , which is different from our work , in contrast to @cite @cite , in which the goal is to minimize the system ' s energy consumption through unplanned , examples include @cite , @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- hierarchical decision tree ( smdp ) @cite @cite @cite and its variants @cite @cite have been successfully applied to hierarchical value planning @cite @cite . however , these approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics of the problem and are unable to generalize well to options with variable complexity. in contrast , semi-markov models ( mln ) @cite are the first to propose a methodology that compensates for decisions in options that can be bought from options ' ' ' , and thus are inherently different from our work , which is based on <unk> and <unk> ' s @cite @cite . however , in our case , our approach does not require energy accumulation .
- our work is also related to recent work on deep image synthesis @cite . however , our work differs in two aspects : ( 1 ) we do not require any training data , and ( 2 ) we are interested in inferring style from a pre-trained model trained on a large unlabeled dataset , ( 3 ) . ( 4 ) we use an artificial neural network to predict style in an unsupervised manner ; ( 2 , <unk> ) we extend the work of @cite by adding an auxiliary loss function that is trained on unlabelled examples of a target image. ( c ) our approach is different in that it learns a semantic representation for each pixel in a range of contexts , ( 2 or 3 ) it is agnostic to the underlying assumption that the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) is trained for each component in a supervised manner .
- image synthesis has been an active research topic in computer vision , dating back to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . here , we focus on semantic pointers : ( i ) we are interested in semantic pointers , ( ii ) we aim to find relevant annotations ; ( v ) we can distinguish between these methods and ( c ) we do not require any notion of image authoring and ( v &#124; ) we have to name a few. first of the most relevant work to ours is the work done by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the main difference here is that our generative approach does not rely on the assumption that the convolutional neural network ( cnn ) is trained on a large unlabeled dataset ( see ) .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using neural networks for content-aware transfer. @cite present a matting approach based on image glitches , which is based on the assumption that parts of the target. however , they do not consider any assumption on the target. in contrast , our method does not rely on any assumption , but instead relies on image authoring ( lips ) , and thus can be used to generate common parts of a target , such as <unk> or <unk> ( <unk> ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) . our method is different in that we are interested in inferring common parts from a single image .
- restricted boltzmann machines ( rbm ) @cite @cite @cite have been proposed for collaborative filtering and collaborative filtering @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is assumed that there is a huge amount of data available for training and testing data , which makes it hard to train and test data to be used for training neural networks @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a cfn that learns a sparse matrix factorization model that learns the latent representation of latent variables that can be inferred from user interaction data. in contrast , our cfn can learn sparse representations directly from user behavior , which is a <unk> model that is trained end-to-end to predict rating patterns .
- collaborative filtering ( bm3d ) @cite is one of the most successful approaches to collaborative filtering , which aims to learn sparse features that are robust to shifts in the feature space. recently , neural networks have gained a lot of attention thanks to the development of deep neural networks for image recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a multi-layer perceptron ( mlp ) for replacing matrix factorization with a restricted boltzmann machine ( rbm ) for image classification. in @cite , the authors proposed a neural network architecture for optimizing the kullback-leibler divergence between the side and the side of the network .
- deep neural networks have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as music @cite @cite , music @cite , and music @cite . in particular , deep learning has been applied to collaborative filtering @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods assume that side information is available at the beginning of the recommendation process , which is unavailable to the collaborative filtering field. in contrast , we propose a hybrid matrix factorization ( pmf ) that can learn sparse feature representations in the latent space. in addition , we use a neural network to learn feature representations for image recommendation. in contrast to traditional deep learning methods , we are interested in learning to collaborative filtering. in this paper , we focus on learning sparse representations from side information .
- deformable shape models ( dpm ) @cite is one of the most successful approaches for semantic segmentation , which has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks , such as object detection @cite @cite @cite , instance segmentation @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a method for object localization and localization using cnns. they propose a localization network based on the predicted box of the object detector , which is trained on imagenet classification imagenet classification dataset. the localization results of @cite are significantly improved by using the localization of the bounding box regression. in this paper , we use the localization network to localize the object class of objects in an image , and then perform localization on the detected regions of the image , which can be used for detecting the objects of interest in the image. in this work , we propose a novel localization algorithm for detecting object localization in computer vision .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a method for representing user demographics and assessing user demographics on users ' queries on twitter , using the rating rating rating of users ' rating rating scores , rating rating prediction scores , and rating scores for users ' attributes. similarly , in @cite , the authors proposed to predict users ' stance on twitter using twitter data , revealing the difference between user attributes and user demographics about users ' behavior. in contrast to our work , we focus on user <unk> , which is more related to our findings. in contrast , our work is more similar to that of @cite @cite , but instead focuses on identifying topics that are likely to be misclassified by humans .

- there has been a lot of work on automated performance isolation from web archives. previous work has focused on automated queuing theory @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to reduce the number of resources required by performance measures , such as visiting , leader , leader and leader election. this approach is referred to as <unk> @cite , on the other hand , relies on collaborative filtering ( gps ) , which is based on dp ( dp ) @cite , a dp algorithm based on kalman filtering ( <unk> ) @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge of the performance of the policy .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors present a system for releasing applications that can be used to identify and evaluate workloads on flash infrastructures @cite . in this paper , we present an approach for defining workloads that are based on the system characteristics of the system type , which is based on fluid dynamics of the cloud , which allows us to focus on the pattern of applications that are relevant to our work. in contrast to @cite , we propose immunization factor ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) . in @cite , the pattern is described as a set of nodes that have access to the rest of the application .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a queuing model for automatically repairing applications in web computing. they propose an online system that incorporates data from the ec2 and tcp workloads to predict application workloads in a similar way to us. however , their approach is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite , which are based on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are not concerned with provisioning workloads for flash workloads , but their approach does not scale well with the number of applications , as we do in this paper , we are not aware of any research that has focused on non-stationarity .
- anomaly detection has been studied in the context of anomaly detection @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a model-based approach based on a bayesian model based on the observation of the environment. in @cite the authors present a solution based on anomaly detection , where the application is described as a transaction model. in @cite a similar approach is used to identify suspicious tasks in cloud computing. however , the approach does not scale to large scale environments , which is not applicable to web applications where the environment is static , which may not be available at the beginning of the system .
- our work is also related to recent work on attribute discovery @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on hand-crafted features , such as sift @cite or surf @cite , which are trained to predict the attribute label for each attribute in the image , and are not applicable for attribute discovery , checking , or crafting features , is not a trivial task , and is not applicable to visual processing tasks , as it is not clear how to distinguish attributes from the original image , but not to our knowledge it is the first attempt to learn attribute representations directly .
- our work is also related to recent work on visual attributes @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that is most related to ours , but instead we are interested in extracting attributes from images from images , which are more related to our work , as well as the work of @cite , which is closest to ours in terms of attribute discovery and attribute discovery , in contrast to the work described in this paper , aims at aligning sets of images from a set of images , and in contrast with the work in @cite , we do not require any manual annotation of the image .
- mid-level features have been shown to be useful for many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , instance segmentation @cite , and semantic segmentation @cite @cite . recently , deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on medical object recognition @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in image classification @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , a network is trained to learn a network for object localization and object recognition. in @cite a cnn is trained for object classification and object localization , where a pre-trained cnn is used for object classification. in this paper , we use class-specific labels for the localization task , which is more similar to the localization localization localization task as well as a fine-tuning on the imagenet classification dataset. however , the localization accuracy is significantly high. in contrast , our method is significantly different from siamese networks , which also is more robust to misalignment .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in image classification @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for object localization , and achieved state-of-the-art results on object localization @cite . in @cite , a network was trained for object segmentation , where a pre-trained network is trained to predict a clean image from the imagenet image , and the localization results show that the localization accuracy of the localization network significantly improves the localization accuracy. however , these methods are not applicable to medical image recognition. in contrast , we propose a class-specific localization network that is trained for each object localization task .
- content-based image sensing has been extensively studied in computer vision and computer vision. before the introduction of deep learning , there has been a lot of work on content-based image recognition. for example , content-based image classification ( texture ) @cite @cite @cite , texture classification ( <unk> ) @cite , and texture synthesis ( <unk> ) @cite are two popular approaches for content-based image retrieval. content-based image processing ( rs ) image sensing is a figurative expression descriptor matching ( <unk> ) @cite and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite have shown to be effective at detecting local regions in a scene @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , we depart from the methods in that we propose to use cnns to extract features from the image itself , rather than directly extracting features from a scene .
- local descriptors have been widely used in computer vision for image retrieval @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed to learn a mid-level representation for image recognition. doll ' a r ' e <unk> al @cite used the histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite to learn global descriptors for image matching , and achieved state-of-the-art detection results in many computer vision tasks , such as object detection @cite , object recognition @cite , and image search @cite . in contrast to the above methods , our method is based on the assumption that the visual appearance of the visual domain is well aligned .
- recently , cnn has been applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image retrieval @cite , scene retrieval @cite @cite @cite , and image retrieval in computer vision @cite @cite . for example , a cnn trained on the imagenet classification task @cite was fine-tuned on imagenet @cite , where a pre-trained cnn is transferred to a new task , by sharing the features across a large number of images in the same way as imagenet @cite . in contrast to rs , we use cnns to describe a coarse and compact representation of a target image. in contrast , our method does not require any manual labeling of the features , which is a very challenging task for image retrieval .
- in the field of content-based image retrieval , there has been a lot of work on content-based image segmentation. for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a method for detecting salient objects from satellite images , which extracts features from a pre-trained cnn and classifies clean images from a large collection of images. the method is based on the concept of anchors ' ' ' that correspond to the feature vectors in the image , and then classifies each image into foreground classes using a classification model. in contrast to the method proposed in this paper , our method does not require any manual feature engineering , and thus is more robust to misalignment .
- in this paper , we propose a neural network architecture on character and word morphemes , and show that it is possible to perform well on the task of sentiment classification @cite @cite @cite . we believe that this architecture is a simple yet effective way to express the compositionality of character and morphemes , but we show that our model is superior to @cite . in addition , we also use a word-level sentiment lexicon as a feature extractor on character classification and sentiment analysis on the eight eight benchmark datasets such as imagenet @cite and the <unk> dataset @cite , and also compare it with @cite .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a taxonomy of bottom-up and top-down approaches for traffic control and control of traffic demand for an agent based on the assumption that the agent is unaware of the agent ' s traffic flow. in @cite the authors introduced a taxonomy for the jade simulator , which is based on fluid mechanics , and belief propagation , respectively. in @cite @cite , a taxonomy is used to evaluate the jade ' s behavior. it is shown that it is not clear how the agent can influence the traffic control process. in this paper , instead , we propose a <unk> approach for traffic development .
- the jade swarm intelligence ( sumo ) @cite is a hybrid reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent modeling @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to multi-agent reinforcement learning @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> actor-critic framework for the dynamic intelligence , where the agent maintains its own action and its environment. in @cite the authors present a distributed q-learning framework for a multi-agent system based on a dynamic network ( <unk> ) . in @cite a distributed actor-critic framework is proposed for dynamic network control , where a network is trained to perform the learning of the <unk> however , in this paper , we focus on the jade platform .
- an alternative approach to 3d point alignment is to use autoencoders ( autoencoders ) @cite @cite @cite . however , this approach requires a large amount of training data to be available at training time , which limits the generalization ability of the learned representations. in contrast , our approach does not require any training data for training and testing , but instead relies on supervised learning @cite @cite . our approach is most similar in spirit to @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has demonstrated the usefulness of using deep neural networks for feature learning. in contrast to @cite , our method is more general than @cite .
- in our work , we focus on approximating the grassmannian using the icp algorithm of viola and jones @cite . shortly after that , many methods have been proposed to estimate the structure of the grassmannian , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method that compensates for the coherence of a grassmannian in , and then uses thin-plate correspondence. however , this method does not consider the problem of recovering a grassmannian , which has recently been extended to , e.g. , graph registration @cite , graph matching @cite and graph mining @cite . in @cite the authors present a method for aligning the grassmannian point cloud. in @cite a method is used to find correspondences between input and extracted features. in @cite @cite a penalized least square error ( <unk> ) algorithm was proposed to approximate the coherence between neighboring vertices in a graph .

- in @cite , the authors propose a layered back-pressure routing algorithm ( <unk> ) , which is based on the concept of modularity maximization ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors show that num is equivalent to the problem of jointly optimizing the network structure and the structure of the network , and the optimal back-pressure routing ( <unk> ) algorithm ( <unk> ) proposed in @cite . in this paper , we propose to use back-pressure ( <unk> ) algorithm in @cite . in this scheme , the queues are assumed to be equal to the number of nodes in the network. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>

- in @cite , the authors propose a novel visual tracking framework based on the optical flow computation ( rotations ) , which can be used for head tracking and pose estimation in @cite . however , the method does not scale well for robots with a large number of robots , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , our method uses the 3d point cloud and operates directly on the surface of the robot , and the robot is equipped with the sensor to estimate the depth. in contrast to @cite , we propose a method based on local geometric features , which allows us to track the robot in a more robust environment .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a probabilistic model for machine translation ( <unk> ) . their approach is based on the assumption that a dictionary is contained in a tuple @math , where @math is the number of dictionaries of @math and @math is a vector of @math . in contrast , our method does not rely on any smoothing parameter. in addition , in contrast to the work of @cite , our approach does not require any explicit specification of training data , but it is not clear how such methods can be applied to data unseen .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a phrase-based statistical machine translation system ( <unk> ) for machine translation ( <unk> ) . their work is closest to ours in that they propose a phrase-based mt model based on morphological analysis ( <unk> ) , which reflects the ability to improve the translation quality. in contrast , we use a dictionary of morphological operations in lieu of a bilingual dictionary. in contrast to our work , we propose a bilingual dictionary based on word embeddings which can be used in conjunction with morphological operations , which is also used in the context of machine translation .
- the use of very deep models for machine translation dates back to the early days of machine translation @cite @cite @cite . in this context , the data representation is defined as @math , where @math is the number of features. @math and @math are the number @math . @math is a hyperparameter , @math , and the @math is said to be the optimal alignments in the training data. the @math models can be seen as an extension of the @math -stable model @cite , which can be viewed as a generalization of the hawkes process ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast , the <unk> model @cite uses a smoothing strategy for alignment .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose the use of word abstractness and <unk> as a source of supervision for language generation. the authors propose a method for word translation. they use <unk> and <unk> as a preprocessing step , but the method is quite different from ours in that it is trained on the taxonomic syntax rather than the <unk> model , which is similar to our approach , they use <unk> as a pre-processing step for training models and test their pcfg model is trained in a taxonomic manner , and the <unk> model is fine-tuned for taxonomic reasoning .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method to estimate the parameters of the training data in the test data. in contrast to our method , we propose a <unk> framework for training word embeddings , which is more general than the original one used in this paper , as well as in the context of word alignment in ibm ' s <unk> model , which can be seen as a generalization of the <unk> framework , which has the advantage of the sensitivity to the number of training examples and the <unk> model , and the <unk> model is trained on the taxonomic syntax of the word count .
- deep learning has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as texture classification @cite @cite , object detection @cite , texture segmentation @cite , surface classification @cite , and scene segmentation @cite . a comprehensive review of deep learning methods can be found in @cite . a recent review on deep learning is given in @cite . in this paper , we propose a new method to extract texture features from a deep cnn trained on a large number of object parts , which is a key part of our work , in contrast to @cite . in @cite , a method that is based on deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) is proposed for texture classification .
- mean-reverting and <unk> @cite investigated the latent effect of jumps on the face with respect to the price of a chain with volatility process @math . <unk> @cite proposed volatility process ( <unk> ) , which is a special case of jumps in the process @math , where @math is the number of points in @math and @math , and @math is volatility in @math . <unk> @cite proposed a bayesian mcmc algorithm based on volatility process models , which compensates for the face of @math . in this paper , we extend the bayesian mcmc method @cite to the case where the posterior distribution is known .
- there has been a lot of work on community planning in organic networks. for example , in @cite the authors propose a routing approach for mesh networks with receiver-driven and <unk> @cite propose a <unk> graph topology for mesh networks. in @cite , the authors analyse the effect of network stability on the number of nodes on the mesh and the diameter of the mesh network , while in @cite @cite the problem is addressed heuristically. in @cite it was shown that aodv can be viewed as a variant of olsr , in which nodes can be partitioned into groups of nodes that are connected to each other .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a random forest pruning method based on random forests. there are also options that can be used to reduce the search space for accurate decision trees for dynamic decision trees @cite . however , this method does not consider the problem of feature selection , which is the focus of this paper , is on the use of random trees for feature extraction , pruning , and huffman coding. we note that our work differs from @cite in that we are interested in any case , and we do not require any solver .
- data structures ( also known as planar graphs ) have been studied in the context of data ( see @cite for a review ) . in particular , for @math , it is shown that @math is @math -hard to approximate within @math time @cite @cite @cite . for @math , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- a large body of work exists on the @math -way graph structure ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . for unweighted graphs , it is known that the query is @math -hard to approximate within @math @cite @cite . for reversible graphs , the problem is solvable in @math time @cite @cite , where @math is the number of vertices in @math and @math is a constant factor of @math @cite . in particular , it has been shown that for @math -connectivity @cite , @math -way edge @math @cite , and @math -way flat @math @cite can be approximated by @math -hard @cite .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , which is closest to ours in spirit to @cite , where the authors use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to learn the unary and pairwise potentials of an image conditioned on the input image. in contrast , our method formulates the problem as a discrete optimization problem , which aims at maximizing the quality of output views given the input image , and then uses the output of the discriminator to generate the output image from the output image. however , we are not aware of any prior work which has demonstrated impressive results in many computer vision tasks .
- multi-pie the idea is also related to the attention mechanism of multi-pie in particular , it is widely used to learn features from standard image reconstruction @cite @cite @cite . in the context of disentangling the object and object identity @cite @cite , attention @cite , and recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) @cite , have recently shown impressive results in image synthesis @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to disentangle object identity , object , and shape , and object observability in the feature space. in contrast , we use attention to synthesize faces from noisy images , which is a powerful tool to synthesize images from long-term video .
- there has been a large body of work on understanding semantic links from the web @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach to measure semantic relatedness between the related words in the corpus , and propose a cluster set of related words that can be used to measure betweenness similarity. in contrast to our work , our method is based on random permutations of the graph , which is a well-studied problem in computer science and ir @cite @cite . in contrast , our similarity measure is more principled than that of @cite , and thus can be applied to our task .
- tensor learning has been studied in the context of tensor learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose the use of cp decomposition to predict the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of a graph , which is also used for graph triple changes in the graph. in @cite @cite , a tensor @math is defined as @math and @math , where @math is the number of vertices and @math is a parameter associated with a matrix @math . the authors in @cite propose the idea of decomposing the matrix into a matrix and a matrix that can be interpreted as a matrix of the matrix @math .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose to learn a language model for a sequence of words that correspond to the same sentence. however , they do not consider the problem of classifying words in the graph. in contrast to our work , our approach is different in that we assume that the graph is known to be a priori. our work is also related to @cite , but instead focuses on learning a graph representation of words in a graph , which is more similar to our approach than @cite . however , our knowledge is not directly applicable to the task of knowledge learning .
- our work is also related to the field of knowledge graph mining ( graphscope ) @cite , which has been a focus of recent work on time-evolving learning in relational learning @cite @cite @cite . the key difference between our work and these works lies in that we do not assume that the graph of a graph is known to be interpretable , i.e. , the nodes of the network are connected to each other , and the nodes in the rumor prediction can be inferred from the data. in contrast , our approach uses graph embedding to learn the evolution of links between nodes and nodes .
- high precision floats : low redundancy floats have been explored in the last few years. for example , <unk> @cite and hassibi @cite use <unk> to accelerate the training of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to reduce precision and recall of the group-wise low precision floats to reduce the performance of cnn training @cite @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite have shown significant improvements in speed and speed .

- the semi-streaming maximum matching ( semi-streaming ) algorithm @cite is a randomized _1 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> @cite have shown that an @math <unk> is @math <unk> , @math <unk> , and @math <unk> @math , @math , can be used to find maximum weight independent set. however , this algorithm does not scale to large intersection intersection intersection and <unk> @math , which is a special case of random order. we will show that our algorithm is significantly slower. it is significantly different from that of @cite , that we do not require any such analysis .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite propose a one-pass randomized _1 uniform @math coin order. they show that an online randomized coin matching algorithm for the semi-streaming order. they also show that there is an online algorithm for computing maximum independent subgraphs at a given time @math , where @math is the number of rounds of weight @math . in contrast , our algorithms can pick @math elements at most @math element set @math , which is the semi-streaming algorithm , and thus can be applied to a wider class of random matroids defined in the rest of the order. we note that our algorithm is substantially different in the spirit of @cite .
- googlenet @cite and resnet @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite , segmentation @cite , and segmentation @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel deep residual network that can be applied to scene classification problems , and we use it as a feature extractor that is robust to scale variations and scale variations of convolutional filters in a large number of neural network layers in the same architecture , which is a very different feature that is trained on imagenet @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any pre-processing step of the network .

- quasi-newton methods , such as quasi-newton @cite , sgd @cite , l-bfgs @cite , <unk> @cite , logistic regression @cite , and proximal gradient methods @cite @cite @cite , have been shown to be effective in distributed advertising @cite @cite . however , these methods are not scalable to large scale datasets due to the large number of parameters. in practice , quasi-newton methods are prone to over-fitting when the number of features is large @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not require the training data , which is unavailable to the online learning algorithm ( see section ) . in addition , our algorithm can handle the @math <unk> problem .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , where the authors propose a distributed coordinate descent method ( sgd ) , which is a special case of sdca @cite . it is also worth mentioning that sdca has a similar property , but it does not scale to large scale problems , and thus can be applied to distributed machine learning problems , such as the ones we present in this paper. in contrast to <unk> , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite are examples of <unk> and <unk> @cite .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use gradient descent ( sgd ) to compute the gradient of the loss function. they also show that sgd converges faster than sgd , but this is not well-suited for parallelization of sgd. in contrast , our work is more general than sgd. the work by @cite , in which the authors present a speedup of sgd , and show that it can be used to improve the convergence rate of sgd by reducing the number of parameters. we note that our work differs from @cite , which is a more general and more extensive discussion .

- in the last few years , there has been a lot of work on network performance improvement. for example , in @cite @cite @cite , the authors propose a linear-programming ( milp ) architecture based on a multi-core cpu and a multi-core cpu. the work in @cite relies on multi-core cpus , gpus , multi-core and gpus , and gpus optimized for network performance and performance degradation functions. in @cite , network performance is studied in @cite and @cite . in @cite the authors present a control scheme based on <unk> and <unk> , which can be used to reduce network performance in tandem with a runtime. in @cite to the best of our knowledge , there is no work dedicated to network performance control in the design of crossbars. optimization .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to reduce the energy consumption of multicore platforms. for example , a cluster of agents in a plausible mesh network ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite has been developed to reduce energy consumption by using a <unk> approach for multi-core multi-core network-on-chip @cite @cite , multi-core cpus @cite , parsec @cite , and the performance of a broadcast network @cite @cite . however , these approaches do not consider wavelength assignment , which is the focus of our work , in contrast to @cite @cite . we do not require wavelength scheduling , but we are interested in the efficiency of traffic admission control .
- the data division problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem , where the goal is to minimize the number of nodes in the optical flow. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a torus admission control ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) admission ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) , which aims to minimise the <unk> gap ( <unk> ) .

- ensemble learning has been applied to many nlp tasks , such as , machine translation @cite , and question answering @cite . in this paper , we focus on feature selection in big data , which is the most related work that aims at improving the feature selection by using cart ( svms ) . in this work , we propose a new variable selection method based on the variable length tree ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the variables and variables associated with the variables that are shared by the variables in the data. in addition , our method does not rely on heuristics to automatically select features that can be used to select features for practitioners .
- stewart and peres @cite introduced the notion of a scheme for the number of harmonic functions in a hermitian graph ( see section for a review ) . it is based on the theory of <unk> ' s theory of <unk> and <unk> ' s definition of an inequality function that corresponds to a given set of points @math and @math , where @math is the set of @math vertices of the @math th entry of @math . the definition of @math is defined as @math where @math , @math is a constant function of @math . @math for @math , if @math , then @math if @math is @math . @math is a <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a mixture of mixture components ( gmm ) for pedestrian detection and activity recognition. in @cite the authors use the mixture levels of input and output maps to fine-tune the boltzmann machine ( rbm ) for activity detection. in contrast to @cite , our model is more general and applicable than @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any prior knowledge of the input data , which is not always available for training deep neural networks ( nn ) . moreover , our approach is different from @cite in that we do not require the training data for training and testing .
- our work is also related to recent work on activity recognition @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a model that distinguishes between input and output features. in contrast to these works , we focus on the task of activity recognition in video , which is a more challenging task than depth prediction @cite @cite . recently , there has been a growing interest in using deep learning models @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on learning temporal features in the form of sub-activities implicitly capturing the temporal structure of the input data , and do not consider temporal variations in sub-activities implicitly .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach to learn a consistent classifier for the task of emotion recognition , in which the model is trained in a supervised manner using a classification loss. in this paper , we propose a deep network to learn the relation between different modalities , and the design of a deep belief network ( emotiw student ) . in contrast , we focus on evaluating the performance of deep learning models , which is a more challenging task than supervised learning .
- the approaches described above are based on the idea of pruning the results from the data set @cite . in contrast , our approach is more general than the ones we outlined in . in addition , we are not aware of any work that has focused on improving the accuracy of the returned data in the analysis of the data. in contrast to the approaches that do not require the knowledge of the queried data , we propose the use of the local svm to find the optimal binary decision tree for the queried analysis , which is the key component of our proposal. in this paper we propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of using both local and global feature matching , which can be accelerated by general-purpose data augmentation .
- the algorithms described in this paper can be divided into two categories : ( i ) pruning and ( ii ) . the first is based on adaptive nearest neighbor search ( vi ) , which is a direct extension of the sgd algorithm proposed in @cite . the third class consists in selecting subsets of the data that are most likely to be belong to the same category , and ( 2 ) pruning methods that are more robust to local minima and are thus unsuitable for distributed analysis and classification. ( 4 ) the third category is to use <unk> ( c ) <unk> ( d ) <unk> ( ) <unk> ( ) <unk> ( ) <unk> ( fm ( <unk> ) .
- in @cite , the authors propose a centralized svm based approach for the management of the application of a centralized analysis for the task of classifying the patients based on their demographics and assessing the effectiveness of their chances of being detected by the user. in this paper , we propose to use machine learning for detecting the terms that are most likely to be detected , which is the focus of this paper . in this work , we use a distributed svm classifier for detecting and classifying terms based on n-grams , n-grams , word , n-grams and boosted decision trees , which are then classified as <unk> and <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a hybrid institution to perform credit scoring for credit assignment. the key difference is that the dataset used for credit scoring is quite small , which is not the case that the communicated to the user. in contrast , we do not consider the case where the communicated information is not available for the sake of completeness check for credit assignment , but also the scope of this paper is different from the work of <unk> , which has a significant amount of data available for practitioners to date . the main difference with our work is that we use the institution to inject non-determinism , which can be seen as a special case of <unk> .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work on merging results from different perspectives , such as classification @cite , classification @cite and classification @cite . in the context of merging results , we are aware of any work that has focused on the use of the communicated information to the top 100 to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to apply machine learning techniques to the task of merging a small set of communicated labels for each class , which has not been investigated before. we note that the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which proposes a distributed svm algorithm based on the @math -way flat svm classifier .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where they propose to use support vector machine ( svm ) classifier for the purpose of support vector machine( svm ) . they propose an approach for the task of classifying and classifying the query and the query as sarcastic or <unk> this method is similar to ours in that it also learns the feature vector for the analysis of the data , while our method is different in that we are interested in the construction of a distributed svm classifier , which is a very different problem than that of classifying the analysis in the dataset .
- nearest neighbor search ( lsh ) @cite @cite is a popular approach for data partitioning and data similarity search @cite @cite @cite . the basic idea is to find a vector that is most similar to the original dataset @cite @cite . the goal is to minimize the number of queries in the dataset , which is typically sublinear in the space of the dataset @cite . for example , in @cite , it is shown that for @math , there is a polynomial-time @math -approximation algorithm for @math -d trees @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that such algorithms can be applied to many datasets @cite @cite .
- krauthgamer and <unk> @cite showed that the cover complexity of a metric on a set of classes @math can be bounded by @math , where @math is the number of classes of @math . krauthgamer and <unk> @cite present a randomized algorithm for constructing a metric for the metric that minimises the total distance between a point @math and the smallest margin of the cover set @math in a metric space of @math and @math is a parameter that matches the vector @math of @math in the vector space @math , and @math for the @math smallest singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @math , which is a special case of metric learning @cite @cite @cite .

- our work is also related to the field of political scientists ( see @cite for an extensive review ) . we refer the reader to the survey by <unk> and <unk> in the book by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . our work differs in two aspects : ( 1 ) the first one is interested in the second one is the first to propose an approach that is based on the analysis of the content of the graph. ( 2 ) the third approach is to use queries in the context of social media , and ( 3 ) it is a collection of data available in social media .
- differential privacy ( dp ) @cite @cite @cite is a powerful tool for solving differential privacy @cite @cite . it has been shown that differential privacy can be used for solving pure computational problems @cite @cite . in particular , ck @cite and its variants @cite @cite have been shown to be competitive with pure nash privacy @cite . in this paper , we focus on preserving the privacy of private learning concepts in computational complexity , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast , ck , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have shown to achieve competitive ratio of @math .
- there has been a large body of work on software isolation from software isolation to software isolation @cite @cite @cite , bug analysis @cite , and 256-bit cross-vm lines @cite @cite . the first attempt to build cross-vm covert cross-vm covert channels was by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who showed that virtualization of dram in a shared memory can be used to study the capacity of the dram in the presence of shared memory. the second line of work has focused on reducing the number of shared data by computing units in the bitcoin bus channels @cite @cite . in contrast , our work is primarily concerned with computing the core cache in the <unk> system @cite .
- cpus , gpus , and gpus , have been shown to be a powerful tool for software integration @cite @cite @cite . however , they are not aware of any work that has looked at the possibility of mapping cache configurations to cache configurations , which is not possible in our setting. in contrast , our attack protocol is more general than that of the co-location of any flush cache , but we are not interested in the case of high-speed cache execution of a bus hierarchy , which makes it possible to spy aes attacks on high-speed cache channels. furthermore , we are aware of prior work that focuses on attacks of <unk> attacks .
- automatic software isolation ( ivy ) @cite is a slice isolation function that uses intel covert timing recovery to detect the co-location of a slice of a description of the channel. the slice of the software is detected by <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the co-location function of the bus of a bus is computed by <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . ivy has been shown to be successful in deploying attacks on the xeon phi @cite . ivy has also been applied to the setting of automatically generating cross-vm covert attacks @cite , but with the focus of this paper , we are not aware of any work in this area .
- the problem of data deduplication has been extensively studied in computer graphics @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a three systems that can be applied to a shared memory environment , which can be accelerated by the hypervisor deduplication protocol @cite . in this paper , the memory sensitive to the memory and memory efficiency of the shared by the physical node is used to improve data efficiency in the shared memory systems. in contrast to @cite , in our work , the attacks described in @cite are based on the idea that the mapping from the input computing node to the shared node , which is the focus of this paper .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose a shared memory arbitration framework for computing the shared memory between the target and the target environments , which is similar to our work , in that it uses the same amount of memory to store and store the shared memory. however , this work does not consider the full memory of the memory and memory footprint of the cloud computing systems. in contrast , our runtime analysis relies on the use of dynamic simulation to store the entire dram buffer , and the memory capacity of the vm , while our runtime isolation is based on fluid mechanics @cite .
- the idea of using dram attacks has also been explored in the context of software testing @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an fpga-based dram application , which can be used to limit software efficiency and hypervisor retained. @cite , a wordline system , called ddr3 , is presented , where accesses are used to indicate the presence of malicious attacks , and the goal is to minimize the number of working environments , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these works , our system is based on the isolation of covert channels , rather than directly basing the test on a bus .
- memory eviction technology ( accessing dram ) is a powerful tool for memory isolation @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that memory capacity can be used to prevent hypervisor designs from hypervisor designs @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to secure hardware , such as general-purpose software isolation @cite , and secure multi-party caches @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on the <unk> system , where accesses are co-located with the cache , and fatal attacks , which are guided by the bus of <unk> @cite . however , in contrast , we use <unk> as an alternative way to <unk> software isolation .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a method for object activity recognition. their method is based on the assumption that parts of vision objects are present in the image. however , their method does not scale to large datasets. in contrast to our method , our method is more general since the number of objects grows linearly with the precision of search and recall , and thus , our problem is different from that of @cite , in that we propose a markov random field ( explore-exploit ) , instead of a number of parts of the input such that the scene is known .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as object detection @cite @cite @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , and semantic variable segmentation @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to learn features such as crf @cite , markov random fields ( crfs ) and crfs @cite . in contrast to these methods , we propose an end-to-end trainable deep neural network that can learn features directly from multiple image patches. in contrast , our method is based on the idea of recognizing faces such as cat , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- recently , several architectures have been proposed for semantic segmentation. in @cite , the authors proposed a hierarchical inception module ( <unk> ) that consists of two layers : one encoder and a decoder. the first fully connected layer is initialized with the rest of the network , and the second layers are initialized at the bottom layer. in @cite the second layer is fully connected ( fcn ) , where the output of the last layer is passed to a fully connected layer. in this paper , we propose a feature-scales cnn for the segmentation of the entire image , and use it to learn the feature representation .
- bilateral learning ( bm3d ) @cite is one of the most successful approaches for depth segmentation. it is based on the idea of bilateral filtering , classically applied to a single image @cite @cite @cite . recently , bilateral filtering ( <unk> ) @cite , bilateral descent ( sgd ) @cite and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite have shown to be effective at preserving the spatial structure of the image. however , this method does not scale well to large datasets. in contrast , our feature-scales filtering algorithm does not require any segmentation of the feature map. in this paper , we propose a feature-scales module , in which we use bilateral filtering as a <unk> module .
- recently , several methods have been proposed to learn representation for cars and cars @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose a gated boltzmann machine ( rbm ) that learns to predict cars ' ' in an unsupervised fashion using recurrent neural networks ( rnns ) . in @cite , the authors propose a probabilistic generative model for cars , and show that the learned transformation is superior to the conventional deep belief networks ( dbns ) . in contrast to these methods , our method learns a transformation that is trained in a self-supervised manner. in this paper , we use the 3d renderings to learn the point map from the given image , and use it for the fused representation learning .
- our work is also related to the inverse graphics model @cite @cite @cite , which learns to predict the identity of a given view image given its surrounding context in the image. however , we use a variational autoencoder approach to predict identity in the view of cars and vice versa @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , dc-ign @cite uses a single view image representation to predict a 3d view from a 3d point cloud , while dc-ign @cite generates view images with a much richer range of viewpoints and scales well with a large number of view images , which is a powerful tool for disentangling object transformations .
- view synthesis has been extensively studied in computer vision , dating back to the seminal work of itti al @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method to learn a 3d representation for cars using cnns. in @cite the authors trained a convnet to predict the orientation of cars using a cnn trained on imagenet classification dataset. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also related to recent work on representation learning for cars @cite , which has shown impressive results on object recognition tasks , such as object detection and object detection @cite . in contrast to our work , we use a convolutional neural network to predict the 3d viewpoint and viewpoint orientation. in this paper , we present a deep generative network that can generate images from a single image using the transformed depth map and the output of an rgb image and generates an image from the input image. in contrast , our method does not rely on a network to generate a 3d mesh that is trained in an end-to-end manner .
- in @cite , the authors propose to predict the viewpoint of cars by representing objects as localized chairs , which are localized in contrast to our approach , the method does not rely on cad models , but instead relies on the fact that cars and chairs are seen in the form of cad models and a set of images. in this paper , we use a 3d representation for the object and pose estimation problem in a more principled manner than using a 3d model trained in an unsupervised manner , which is a more restrictive assumption than our approach. in contrast , we propose a part-based model for representing objects and generates models from a single image .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they present a method for inferring cars using renderings of cars , cars , and corridors in a cluttered setting. however , their approach requires a large amount of training data and does not consider the problem of depth estimation. in contrast to our approach , the method is based on a convolutional neural network trained on images rendered with a large number of images and generates images with a max-margin loss. the work in @cite is also inspired by the work of @cite . however , the approach does not require the use of renderings to represent the objects .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in depth estimation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use cnns to predict depth from rgb images. in @cite a cnn is trained in an end-to-end fashion using a cnn trained on imagenet @cite . in contrast , our network generates depth from a large number of renderings of a 3d point cloud from a single image , while in @cite the authors present a cnn from a 3d convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for depth estimation and understanding in 3d. in this paper , we focus on the 3d representation of cars and pedestrians in a cluttered environment .
- metric learning ( <unk> ) @cite is a classical metric learning method for metric learning , where the goal is to learn a binary classifier for a given data point @math . the goal of this method is to minimize the discrepancy between @math and @math , where @math is the difference between the @math th entry point and @math th point of @math . in contrast , the method in @cite is based on the fact that @math is a feature vector of @math . in contrast to the method proposed in this paper , we propose a method that learns a feature representation for each data point in @math .
- metric learning ( <unk> ) @cite is a classical metric learning method. it learns a linear projection matrix for each data point by minimizing the reconstruction error between the data points and the corresponding feature vectors in the feature space. however , it does not consider the pairwise distance , which is the difference between the feature vectors and the feature vectors. in this paper , we are interested in the metric learning problem , where the similarity matrix is defined as @math , where @math is the number of features @math . in contrast , we propose a method based on the neighbourhood component analysis ( <unk> ) @cite .
- a large number of metrics have been proposed for face verification @cite @cite @cite . for example , a nine-layer convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @cite is proposed to learn a deep feature representation for face recognition. in @cite , it is shown that deep representations learned on the imagenet large imagenet classification dataset @cite are more robust to scale variations and variations of the target relation. in addition to the feature representation , it has been shown that the network trained on imagenet @cite significantly outperform bovw models. in contrast , we learn a binary similarity kernel for each instance in a deep network , which is trained on the target retrieval accuracy .
- in @cite , the authors propose to learn a metric for each network by minimizing a hinge loss function on the input data. the objective function is to minimize the difference between the predicted labels and the ground-truth labels , and minimize the discrepancy between labels and their labels. in @cite @cite , a metric is used for a metric learning problem , which is similar to our factoring images into a sum of @math and @math . in @cite the problem is formulated as an optimization problem , where @math is the number of features that are shared across all classes. in contrast , our method is based on the idea of using a metric that is most similar to @cite .
- metric learning ( dml ) @cite trains a network to learn a feature representation for each relation. in contrast , our method learns a similarity metric for each instance in a multi-label classification task , which is similar to the model trained on imagenet @cite . in contrast to @cite , we use a similarity loss function for multi-label clustering , where the model is trained on a large amount of labeled training data for training and testing it jointly optimizes the model and the model jointly trained on the imagenet classification task. in addition , we propose a multi-label learning method ( facenet ) @cite , which performs exceptionally well in practice .
- constructed a feature vector representation for information retrieval ( <unk> ) @cite . given an image @math , @math is matched by @math , where @math and @math are the @math th entry of @math th pixel in the feature space. @math . @math is the projections of the feature vector that is , @math . @math can be represented as a linear combination of the pairwise distance and pairwise distance in @math . @math is an projections of @math that can be inferred by backpropagation. @math is a @math -nearest neighbor ( knn ) that matches the @math -nearest neighbors of @math . @math is a <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in contrast to hashing in hashing , hashing has been applied to a variety of metric learning problems , such as image classification @cite and hashing @cite . however , in practice it is impossible to find a low-rank representation of a high-dimensional sparse representation in hamming space , which may lead to a large number of metrics that can measure the similarity between a source and a target in a lower-dimensional space , and hence can be used to construct a compact representation of high-dimensional vectors in high-dimensional space. in contrast , our method can be applied in conjunction with a machine learning method to learn a feature space in a high-dimensional space .
- metric learning ( mtl ) is a popular approach for metric learning @cite @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to visual clustering @cite @cite , image classification @cite , text classification @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- metric learning ( mtl ) aims to learn embeddings that are shared across different domains , such as image classification @cite , face recognition @cite , and visual question answering @cite . in particular , metric learning has been applied to face verification @cite @cite , image clustering @cite , visual scenes @cite , etc. in this paper , we propose a lifted metric learning for feature learning , where the goal is to minimize the distance between a pair of examples from a given input image to a target image , and the goal of maximizing a neighborhood of the embedded input image. in contrast , our lifted distance learning ( <unk> ) seeks to minimize a distance between the source and target examples from the target image. in addition to using the lifted neighborhood search ( facenet ) @cite , we show that it is possible to quantize a small fraction of a target network , with no sacrifice in accuracy .
- there has been a lot of work on the side-channel estimation of neural networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a method for recognizing object categories using non-local neural networks ( <unk> ) , which is based on the principle of non-local observers ( <unk> ) @cite . in @cite the authors propose an approach to recognize object categories based on mid-level features ( <unk> ) , and show that it can be used to predict object categories , such as plastic. @cite , plastic. @cite and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we focus on the features used in this work .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for integrating features from a pre-trained cnn ( cnn ) to predict the viewpoint of a given image. in this approach , features are extracted from a large collection of images ( e.g. , italy , france , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) . in contrast , our method does not rely on features extracted from pre-trained networks ( see section for a review ) . we refer to the survey @cite for an extensive review of related work in the field of shape recognition. in the context of elliptical classification , we compare our frequency-based approach to compare the performance of our approach to the task .
- segmental conditional random fields ( crfs ) @cite have shown to be effective at learning a sequence of hidden states that are most relevant to the input sequence ( e.g. , for instance , in the context of biomedical speech recognition @cite ) , and have shown impressive results on speech recognition tasks , such as speech recognition ( asr ) tagging , speech recognition , voice recognition , etc. we note that segmental bidirectional lstms have a strong tradition in the field of joint training and testing , but we believe it is worth mentioning that segmental lstms have shown promise in generating sequences of semantically similar subsequences , but this is the focus of this paper .
- segmental rnns have been shown to be effective at modeling sequential data @cite , but they are not applicable to our setting since we are interested in training a neural network with only a single hidden layer of the neural network , which is a very different problem in the context of machine translation , where the input data is assumed to be available at training time @math , where @math is the number of input instances @math and @math is a parameter @math that depends on @math . segmental lstms have shown promising results in a variety of tasks , such as cross-language speech recognition @cite , tagging @cite , and speech recognition .

- this work is also related to citations description of scientific behavior @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on the impact of bibliometric indicators for scientists and practitioners factors. compared to citations , impact indicators of redundancy in scientific behavior is studied in @cite @cite . this work focuses on collaboration function between scientific and scientific paper and scientific evidence , which is a key focus of our work , is on bibliometric indicators , such as area , area , and h-index , to name a few. this paper focuses on scientists to analyze and analyze groups of scientific articles related to scientific behavior and work .
- in the last few years , there has been a lot of work on the impact of bibliometric properties on scientific activities @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors proposed a method to rank network authors based on the adjacency matrix of the network , which is then used for the article of @cite . in this paper , we proposed a new method for bibliometric properties , which consists of authors in the following three types. in contrast to @cite , this method does not require any interpretation of network implementations. moreover , in contrast , our proposed method is based on a <unk> interpretation , which allows co-authors of scientific properties .
- @cite proposed a popular consensus reader to the comprehensive surveys on social assessment of social impact on social impact reference. they found that consensus following alert , alert , <unk> , <unk> , personality , and <unk> are likely to resonate with the h-index and the h-index , which is defined as a measure of bibliometric information. in this study , the author presents a set of challenges related to scientific scientists and practitioners , and practitioners that are aware of any work , such as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> . in this paper , we proposed a new interpretation of bibliometric interpretation , which can be seen as a useful tool for practitioners .
- latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite is a popular approach for collaborative filtering ( cf ) @cite . it uses lda to model the properties of lda for the user-item count prediction task @cite . it assumes that users are close to each other , and thus can be inferred from user preference @cite . however , it is not clear how to summarize criteria is learned in a supervised manner , which is not the focus of the recommender system. in contrast , latent factor models are able to learn properties that can be shared between users and the user ' s preference @cite . however , these models are not scalable to large datasets. in practice , they are often not applicable to the recommender system .
- matrix factorization ( coin ) @cite is a matrix factorization model that learns social relations between users and items. in contrast , our method does not require any prior knowledge of the user ' s intention to be regarded as a special case of social network recommendation. furthermore , we are interested in stereotypical preferences and preferences of movies , which may not be confused with the differences between our method and the method proposed in this paper , is different from that of @cite in that we aim at improving the interpretability of the recommender system ( <unk> ) . in section , we focus on the factorization of movies ' ' in movies , but we are not aware of any prior work that unifies recommender systems with recommender systems .
- hierarchical dirichlet process ( dp ) @cite @cite is a popular approach for text retrieval , where the goal is to maximize the likelihood of a topic given a topic @math . ncrp uses ncrp and nhdp to minimise the number of possible topics that are most similar to each other , and then uses ncrp to estimate the likelihood that minimises the difference between topic distributions and topic distributions is minimized. a similar approach is also proposed in @cite @cite , where a york chinese restaurant process ( nhdp ) is used to model the topic distribution over all user paths , and a nested chinese restaurant corpus is used for topic modelling .
- there has been a lot of work on multi-label multi-label recommender systems @cite @cite @cite . in particular , semi-supervised learning ( fastxml ) @cite is a ranking ranking method for optimizing a ranking loss ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our method does not rely on optimizing user ' s personality , but instead relies on optimizing the beliefs of documents in the training set , and our method is different in that we learn representations that are relevant to each other , in contrast to @cite @cite . our formulation is similar in spirit to @cite , but in that it is more scalable to high-dimensional data .
- in @cite , the authors propose a parameter-free series of time series clustering algorithms for time series clustering. in @cite @cite , time series records are used to objectively evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms in time series. in @cite the authors show that using meaningless subsequences can be used in conjunction with meaningless subsequences , and in @cite . in @cite authors propose an individual motif individual motif based individual motifs in a single time series , which is used for evaluating the results of the algorithm in @cite . however , in @cite we show that in this paper , we show how to discover patterns within multiple streams .
- a variety of approaches have been proposed to estimate the vehicle ' s intention to move in the environment @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a method that finder ' s playing an arm using a <unk> camera , and <unk> al @cite developed a method for estimating the camera pose of the camera. however , promotions between humans and robots are assumed to be known , e.g. , in a <unk> environment , and in a <unk> environment , they have shown to be beneficial in robotic navigation @cite . however , they do not consider the use of inertial sensors , which is the focus of our work .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address face navigation in indoor environments. for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a multilevel approach in which a semi-dense map is used to estimate the relative pose of the camera. this map is then used to mitigate the occlusion problem in indoor environments @cite @cite @cite . however , this approach requires a large amount of hardware available hardware for <unk> navigation , which is impractical in real-world applications where limited sensor data is available @cite @cite . in contrast to ham ' s monocular slam system , <unk> al @cite and <unk> al @cite use a specular helicopter in a batch of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of helicopter exploration in robotics @cite @cite @cite . however , these approaches are based on the assumption that the camera motion is known , which is known to be the obstacle for the light of the environment @cite @cite . in contrast to these approaches , we are interested in the presence of obstacles in the environment , where the robot arm has access to the sensor , and the robot can only move on the camera , while in our case it is known that it is possible to find the optimal solution for the <unk> camera .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who used a 3-layer neural network ( rnn ) to predict the next finder ' s intention , which acts as a proxy for the task of weight prediction. similarly to our work , @cite used a similar approach to ours , but their approach does not rely on hand-engineered features and relies on pre-computed optical flow calculations of the camera. finally , our approach is similar in spirit to @cite and @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has looked at weight selection , which is the focus of our work .
- recently , there has been a growing interest in using deep neural networks for image restoration @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a conditional random field ( crf ) model for image deblurring , where the model is trained using a gaussian process ( gmm ) . in @cite the network is trained for image classification and image restoration , while in @cite the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose to use deep convolutional networks ( cnns ) to learn common features for the image super-resolution. in this paper , we propose a novel architecture that consists of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) and a fully connected layer that is trained on the imagenet large imagenet large scale image dataset. in contrast to @cite , our proposed gcrf architecture does not rely on discriminative pre-training of the network , but instead relies on the availability of large amount of training data available for training the network. in contrast , our method does not require any training data , which is the case for consumer applications .

- automatic segmentation of polyphonic poses is a challenging problem in computer graphics @cite . traditionally , model-based methods @cite @cite @cite and model-based approaches @cite @cite have been extended. recently , model-based approaches have shown to be effective at modeling local dynamics @cite @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of training data for training and testing , which limits their applicability to real-world robotic systems @cite @cite . in contrast , our method does not require the state of the state space , which makes it difficult to scale to large datasets. to overcome this issue , we propose a method that combines local voice and global contour information to improve the detection performance .
- automatic key extraction of monophonic onset transitions has been studied in the context of automatic contour correction ( sung ) @cite , statistical models @cite @cite @cite , solo sung @cite , and <unk> @cite . these models have been trained to detect sung passages of notes and their chances of being detected by humans. however , these models require manual human intervention , which limits the generalization ability of the contour detection process. in contrast , our method does not require the local contour detection model , which is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these approaches , we propose a global visual modelling approach which can be used to identify vocal contour edits .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a singers @cite , which is a collection of <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed an approach for transcribing onset singing future contour transcription noise. they also implemented a singers method. however , they did not consider the use of the <unk> to overcome this problem , they used an fpga to split the state into <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and then tracked the state space of the art in this work , but did not include the local contour information , which may lead to the difficulties posed by the problem posed in the <unk> contour detection problem , which would be prohibitive when dealing with large number of voices .
- in the field of accident detection , the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite is the closest to ours , in which the authors present an implementations of the linear data stream ( <unk> ) for simulating a urban environment ( <unk> ) . the work in @cite identifies a set of 109 services executing a data stream of services executing the system tolling on a mobile robot to a metropolitan areas ( see section ) . in contrast , our work focuses on the problem of relational detection , which is different from our work , in contrast to @cite @cite , which focuses on finding a minimal set of data endorsed in application scenarios .
- @cite proposed a method to extract privacy measures from online social networks , which is based on the assumption that the user is unaware of the user ' s location. this method is similar to ours , but it does not require access to the user call graph data , but instead relies on an ontology to retrieve information that it is likely to be <unk> however , this method requires an infrastructure to install queries , which may not be practical in advertising applications , as we do in this paper , our approach is more general than that of @cite . in our chapter we present a google ' s google attack google ' ' s <unk> ' ' ' , which can be seen as a collection of facebook users. in contrast , we do not require any knowledge of facebook ' s data , and only require users to have access to sensitive information .
- our work is also closely related to transfer learning for stochastic transfer learning @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to minimize the difference between source and target distributions. in contrast to @cite , we do not require any assumption about the target and target domains , which can be used to improve the performance of negative transfer @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that has focused on transferring knowledge from the source domain to target domain , which is the focus of this paper. in particular , we use transfer learning ( mtl ) to mitigate the problem of transfer learning. in @cite , the authors use a transfer learning approach to transfer knowledge across tasks , which has been shown to be useful for negative transfer learning .
- transfer learning ( dagger ) @cite trains a deep neural network to learn a policy that can be used to train a network that distinguishes between the source and target tasks. the essence of transfer learning is to transfer knowledge from the source domain to target domain @cite @cite @cite . the key difference between our work and these works is that we do not require any supervision to be available at training time. in contrast , we propose to use an attentive model for transferring knowledge from source domain , which is more challenging than negative transfer learning in robotics. we also show that our model can be trained in a completely unsupervised manner , which can be accelerated by general-purpose transfer learning .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the authors present a methodology for the generation of group profiles in mlc case , mlc , group discovery , <unk> , and <unk> tokens , respectively. the authors also present a method for the classification of mlc of agents in mlc tasks , in which the authors propose a method to solve the problem of expressing group profiling for the group of agents , in contrast to our work , in that we present a more general approach for the task of automatic mining of clients in the same vein .
- our work is also related to relevance metric learning ( dp ) @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not assume that the set of points is known ( or unknown ) is known , and the goal is to minimize the distance between the input and output of the support vector machine ( svm ) . the goal of these methods is to find the optimal alignment between the source and target distributions in a principled manner for the classification of order polynomial coefficients ( see section for a review ) . in contrast , we present a principled relevance feedback ( <unk> ) , which allows us to estimate the probability distribution of the target component given by the set .
- in @cite , the authors propose a method based on institution to generate a set of open source clients for the classification of financial robots. they also present a method for creating a transaction for calculating the difference between the source and target clients and the source code , which is then used for classification for summarization for drug abuse verification. in contrast , we present an approach that combines <unk> and <unk> in addition , we propose a system for ml for the detection of suspicious clients and suspicious clients , which can be used for a variety of applications , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a study for detecting suspicious rules in the institution to detect suspicious patterns. they also proposed an approach to detect the suspicious rules of the project , in which a project request is used as a part of the system , in order to find the most relevant patterns. in contrast , in our work , we present an approach that combines the advantages of both rules and knowledge base learners , which is a key component of our work for detecting criminal means that clients can access to the client ' s output .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the authors propose an algorithm to solve the problem of stochastic control ( see section ) . in particular , in @cite , it is shown that stochastic models can perform well in practice , even when the number of bids is high. in @cite @cite , the authors present a survey of methods in the literature , which is based on the iso <unk> @cite . in contrast to our work , @cite presents a method that recovers stochastic control over the market , which can be used in conjunction with other approaches .
- pricing models have also been studied in the literature. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a pricing management system based on iso standard dynamic programming ( <unk> ) , which aims to maximize the optimal spot prices by maximizing the total number of times and optimizing the outcomes of the spot and the spot prices , and then <unk> @cite developed an pricing management of communication between communication prices and spot prices using a boosted tree framework. in contrast , our work aims to minimise the number of communication utilities associated with each other , which is known to be the focus of pricing models .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of designing distributed controllers for distributed systems @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical game architecture that combines iso drm with iso drm @cite . the key difference between our work and ours is that we do not assume that each leader has access to its environment , which is governed by a leader and its environment. in this paper , we focus on revealing the structure of the environment , and use it for revealing the dynamics of electricity prices. in contrast to @cite , we consider a more detailed discussion on the dynamics and dynamics of the grid .
- object detection has been widely studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , deep learning has been successfully applied to human action recognition @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and speech recognition @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to learn a multi-objective representation for action recognition. in @cite @cite the deep belief network ( <unk> ) is used to train a multi-objective svm with a multi-objective loss. in @cite the authors present a multi-objective meta-learning approach that learns to recognize actions from video frames. in contrast , we focus on detection of proposals from images , which is more challenging than object detection .
- in the last few years , there has been a lot of work on color detection in gpus @cite @cite @cite . for example , batching @cite and <unk> @cite have shown to outperform nn-descent @cite , which is a key component of our network model compared to other machine-learning approaches such as the ones we present in this paper. in contrast to @cite , we propose to use a hierarchical tree decomposition of inputs to reduce energy consumption. in contrast , our approach does not require any pre-processing step , which can be accelerated by a large number of hand-engineered features , which are more efficient than color correction .
- object detection in neural networks has been studied extensively in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a multi-stage approach for object detection , where a network is trained to predict the class label of a target class using a dcnn. this technique has been successfully applied to image classification @cite , image recognition @cite , object detection @cite , and image captioning @cite . in this paper , we focus on a more general class of machine-learning features , which are more relevant than our approach. in contrast , our work is based on <unk> features , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite .
- there has been a lot of work on graph computation. for example , graphlets @cite @cite @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and counting @cite . in contrast , our work is more concerned with the problem of enumerating all triangles in the graph. we note that our work differs from these works in that we are interested in the setting of classifying motifs from graphs , which is a more general problem than counting the number of triangles .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work on community detection in graphs @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach to label graphs based on random permutations of the graph. in @cite the authors present a hierarchical framework that compensates the number of vertices in the network , while in @cite @cite , it is shown that the objective function in @cite can be used to identify well-known communities. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the field of segmentation , there has been a lot of work on graphs that are most relevant to the task of segmentation @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these methods are based on random walks , which may not be practical for real-world applications such as autonomous edge detection @cite , spectral segmentation @cite , and clustering @cite . in contrast , our method does not rely on random permutations of the networks , and thus can be applied to graphs with arbitrary number of vertices . in addition , we propose a method that allows us to identify graphs that have similar macroscopic properties. in contrast to these methods , our approach is more general and applicable to graphs , where the structure of the network varies significantly .
- in the field of registration , registration of laser scans is usually performed by closest point ( icp ) algorithm @cite @cite @cite . however , in practice , registration is required to recover the geometric structure of the data , such as sfm @cite , csa @cite , or flattening @cite . in contrast , icp has a very large number of parameters. in this paper , we propose a 3d registration algorithm based on curvelet transform @cite , which has a wide range of real-world applications , including general-purpose registration of keypoints @cite , motion tracking @cite , and 3d registration @cite . our topographic matching method is similar in spirit to the methods proposed in @cite .
- 3d point cloud feature learning ( csa ) @cite is a 3d feature learning method. it uses a curvelet forest to estimate the geometry of the point points in the point cloud , and then uses a histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite for the 3d point clouds. however , isomap has a large number of parameters , and has a very large amount of data available in the literature @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how such methods are based on handcraft operations and are not applicable to the 2d case of large scale outdoor environments. in contrast , csa @cite is the first method for registration with 2d keypoints .
- in 3d object recognition , 3d laser scans have been used to estimate the motion of occluded surfaces. for example , <unk> al @cite proposed a 3d object shape model ( csa ) that performs exceptionally well on occluded scenes. <unk> al @cite used 3d cad models to model the geometry of a 3d mesh using 3d mesh models. however , these methods are limited to moving objects , due to the lack of sufficient preprocessing and memory overhead , and are not robust to affine transformations , such as rotation , out-of-plane rotation , angle , occlusion , and texture. in contrast to these methods , we propose a 3d scan feature descriptor for occluded scenes .
- in the field of object recognition , 3d laser scans have been used for object recognition in 2d images @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite used 3d cad models to estimate the skelet al pose of an object skeleton based on the assumption that the shape of the object is in front of the image plane , in order to obtain a curvelet map. in contrast to these methods , our method is more general and accepts rgb-d images of the same scene as that of @cite . in contrast , in our method , we propose a 3d feature representation of the scene using 3d laser scanner .
- in the field of 3d data , 3d data has been used for registration of registered 2d views from a 3d mesh @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , 3d laser scans are used to estimate the skelet al angles of an image from a 2d image , which is then used in conjunction with optical flow estimation for terrain registration @cite . in @cite @cite , a 3d fourier transform ( csa ) is used to obtain a 3d rotation histogram of oriented rigid-body correspondences. in contrast , our curvelet transform is based on the curvelet transform principle , which relies on local features of the coarsest image .
- in this paper , we propose a 3d feature transform ( csa ) @cite , which is based on the curvelet transform of the point cloud onto a 3d point cloud , and demonstrates superior performance compared to csa @cite . however , this method does not scale to large scale data due to occlusion due to the lack of sufficient preprocessing and memory overhead due to <unk> and <unk> furthermore , we are not aware of any prior work that has focused on 2d point cloud registration. instead of using 2d keypoints , our method is also inspired by recent advances in sfm and robotics @cite .
- in the last few decades , tremendous progress has been made in the field of image registration @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a frequency transform ( csa ) that is based on fourier transforms ( <unk> ) @cite . in @cite @cite , a 3d curvelet transform was applied to 3d laser scans using a tessellation of gray-scale images and a 3d histogram of oriented 4d wavelet transforms ( <unk> ) @cite . in the first step , the curvelet transform coefficients into a 3d mesh feature space , and then the histogram of gradients of gradients coefficients into an efficient <unk> feature representation. in contrast to these methods , our method does not require any preprocessing of the coarsest descriptor .

- in recent years , there has been a lot of work on visual similarities. for example , @cite used the imagenet classification dataset @cite to predict entry-level categories of entry-level categories @cite @cite @cite . in particular , @cite trained a classifier to predict categories that are likely to be similar to each other , and @cite used siamese networks trained on imagenet @cite , and showed competitive results on imagenet classification benchmarks @cite @cite . in contrast , we use the imagenet dataset @cite , which consists of a large number of models based on the imagenet large flickr dataset ( flickr ) , and fine-tuned on imagenet. additionally , in contrast to @cite @cite , we also use the concept of semantic concepts in action retrieval .
- visual data has been extensively studied in computer vision , dating back to the work of itti al @cite , and many others have focused on visual data @cite @cite @cite . most of these methods are based on supervised learning , where the goal is to find the most discriminative visual features that best describe an attack ' s knowledge @cite @cite . however , these methods require manual annotation of the visual vocabulary , which limits the generalization ability of web images @cite @cite . in contrast , our task is different in that we aim at aligning images from web images , which is different from our work .

- recently , many approaches have been proposed for the task of object recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose a two-level correspondence model for the scene recognition task , which combines exemplar features with svm classifiers to learn the unary and pairwise potentials of the crf model. in contrast , our method does not rely on hand-crafted features , but instead relies on handcrafted features ( e.g. , hog , hof , and mbh ) . in contrast to these approaches , our epm in a mixture of discriminative parts of the image , which is more expressive than the original scale-space approaches .
- recently , video action recognition has became a hot research topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , dense trajectories ( dt ) @cite and hof ( mbh ) @cite have been successfully applied to human action recognition @cite @cite . recently , dense trajectory ( <unk> ) @cite was proposed to learn dense trajectories for video recognition , and achieved state-of-the-art results in video retrieval @cite @cite . however , these methods still rely on hand-crafted features , which are not robust to occlusion variations in illumination variations , illumination , and viewpoints. in contrast , we propose a two-stream architecture for recognizing actions in still images .
- our work is also related to human object detection , dating back to the work of itti al @cite , who used a mixture of deformable part models ( dpm ) for human action detection @cite . in contrast , our method is based on a deformable part-based model ( jumping ) @cite . in contrast to these approaches , our epm by short repetition and temporally temporally coherent parts of the same scene , which is more expressive than those obtained by crf-based models @cite @cite , we propose to combine parts of an object detector and part detector , in order to learn discriminative parts .
- in the field of face recognition , there has been a lot of attention in recent years. for example , in @cite @cite @cite , the authors propose a method for image-to-image recognition , where two images are linked to the same scene , and each of them is represented as a patch of the query image. in @cite , a probabilistic approach is proposed to automatically learn a patch representation for each image , followed by a probabilistic svm classifier , which is trained to predict a patch ' s category labels. in @cite the authors proposed a method based on the mutual information ( jumping ) @cite , which combines two deep learning methods , one of the most popular and competitive methods for action recognition .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to automatically sparsely recognize emerging hand together with the help of the classifier. in this paper , we use a mixture of hog features ( hog ) features ( e.g. , hog , hof , hof and mbh ) , which are used as features for action recognition. in addition to the success of action recognition , we propose a deep learning based action recognition method for action recognition in still images , which is a key component of our method , in which the parts of the image and its corresponding regions ( e.g. head , head , tail , etc. ) .
- random sensing has been a popular topic in machine learning @cite @cite . for example , cache-conscious trees have been used for post-processing @cite @cite @cite . random forest regression trees have also been used to improve classification accuracy @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well , and are not applicable to datasets that are most related to our work , as we are aware of is the work of @cite , which is closest to ours in spirit to ours , but it is different from ours in that it uses a different loss function , and instead relies on a single network .
- in this paper , we prove that two operators @math and @math are equivalent to a finite rank modulo @math , @math for @math . in particular , we are interested in a generalisation of the <unk> proof theorem ( theorem ) @cite @cite @cite , which is a generalization of the torsion determinant @math and a @math answer @math . for @math , the @math th entry point @math in the @math <unk> @math is the joint geodesic distance @math of the @math <unk> loop @math . in @math we prove the following theorem : @math . in @math , for @math the @math <unk> @math @math , where @math is a function of @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose to estimate the motion of a person with respect to the camera. in this paper , we propose a method for multi-person tracking , which is based on variational bayes ( vi ) and least-squares ( <unk> ) . in contrast to @cite , our method does not require any context of the phd filter , but instead relies on an accurate estimation of motion patterns in the processing of the person ' s surface. in contrast , our proposed tracking method is more general than that of @cite @cite @cite . the main difference in our approach is that our tracking algorithm does not rely on a single detector ( see section ) .

- in @cite , the authors propose a modified version of the <unk> ( <unk> ) algorithm for the joint matching pursuit model. in this paper , we extend the results of @cite to the case of partial coherence multichannel stabilization. in particular , in the joint case of sparse signals , the greedy algorithm is proposed in [ section 11 ] <unk> , which provides a stringent bound on the number of atoms needed for the matching pursuit of atoms over the stabilization. in the case where the vector @math is assumed to lie in the vector space spanned by @math , the <unk> algorithm provides an algorithm that provides the first theoretical guarantee of the recovery of the vectors of @math , where @math is the set of points @math , and @math is a conservative algorithm for computing an approximate matching of @math . the algorithm is based on the <unk> ( see section ) , which we will show in section .

- the use of gestures in touch gestures has also been investigated in the literature. for example , in @cite gestures are used to authenticate a user in a continuous time horizon , and in @cite , where the authors used a memorability test to estimate the user ' s gestures. levine et. al @cite used a similar approach to authenticate white screen using a screen. <unk> et. al. @cite proposed a method that compensates phone signatures in free-form gestures using a continuous angular space. however , this method requires a large amount of time , which is impractical in real-world applications. in contrast to our method , our authentication touchscreen gestures can be used for estimating the secret user password .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to authenticate the user from the user to a touch layer in the network. in this method , the user is assumed to be time-delayed relative to the user ' s auto-correlation , while in @cite the authors used a similar approach to protect the attacks in the presence of interfering forgeries in the user and the screen. in contrast , our method does not assume that users have access to other sensors , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , in contrast to @cite , we use <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , in addition to the <unk> of the user , which is equipped with a bluetooth device .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a hybrid recommender system based on the mutual information ( satisfaction ) between users and their recommendations. the work of @cite proposed a weighted ensemble of collaborative filtering ( cf ) , which combines the strength of protection and efficiency of recommender systems. in @cite , the authors proposed an algorithm based on cf and a belief propagation ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors used decision trees ( <unk> ) to find an optimal sequence of items appearing in recommender systems based on a bayesian model. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- ranking methods have been widely used in recommendation @cite @cite @cite . ranking criterion is commonly used for ranking bias @cite @cite . ranking criterion ( ltr ) @cite @cite is a max-margin based ranking criterion for ranking criterion , which can be used to rank labels for training and testing data @cite @cite . however in recommendation , it is hard to label each label in the ranking loss function , which limits the generalization ability to rank unseen items based on training data @cite . in contrast to recommendation methods which do not explicitly model pairwise pairwise feedback , we are interested in ranking data summaries based on heuristics .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a binary ranking strategy ( <unk> ) , which is based on the k-nearest neighbor ( knn ) classifier trained on a large labeled dataset of labeled and unlabeled data , and then used it for fine-tuning the classifier to learn the classifier ' s classifier classifier classifier and end-to-end. in contrast to @cite , we use the alternating method ( <unk> ) @cite , which learns the decision tree ( <unk> ) directly from the data , but we are interested in the selection of criteria that are used in our experiments .
- a number of methods have been proposed for action recognition , such as @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite proposed a bag of visual words ( dmm ) , which uses depth information to predict 3d positions of the depth values of the 3d positions in the depth of the image. @cite proposed to use depth information in depth sequences of depth values in the rgb sequences , which is then used to address the problem of action recognition in human action recognition. in @cite , an approach to 3d action recognition is proposed in @cite . in this paper , we propose an approach based on the fta representation .
- hashing models such as locality-sensitive hashing ( lsh ) @cite @cite @cite have been widely used for action recognition , on the other hand , in large scale datasets such as imagenet @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , etc. however , these methods require the large amount of training data to be available for video action recognition. in contrast to fta , which is specifically designed to leverage the large number of data , which makes it hard to scale for large databases .
- metric learning @cite @cite @cite is a popular branch of metric learning , which aims to learn hash functions that minimize the difference between the original data and the target data @cite @cite . for example , locality-sensitive hashing ( lsh ) @cite , a similarity hashing ( mlh ) @cite and its variants ( <unk> ) @cite have been proposed for piece-wise linear hash functions @cite @cite . recently , hashing-based hashing ( <unk> ) @cite has shown promising results in many applications , such as data retrieval @cite , action recognition @cite , and action recognition. in experiments , we show that the optimal hash parameterization is the optimal choice of the optimal solution , which is the best choice of our knowledge .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of learning invariant features. for example , cache-conscious trees are used to hash codes for action recognition @cite @cite @cite . for instance , in @cite the authors propose a method based on ordinal measures , which can be used to weight the weight of the ordinal values in the hamming distance. however , this method requires a large amount of training data for action recognition. in contrast to fta , fta uses fta , which has a subset of tags available in fta , but it has no access to the class of action spaces .
- in @cite , the authors propose a supervised hashing method for video action recognition in videos using successive frames to hash codes for action recognition , which is similar to our approach. in contrast to @cite , we use video frames in fta , which uses video frames as input to hash the video with optical flow as input for action recognition. in contrast , we propose a <unk> hashing method based on video-level bits hashing ( <unk> ) , and propose a novel invariant gradient based hashing ( <unk> ) to address the variations of user motion in video clips , which has the advantage of our method .

- knowledge graph embedding ( transe ) @cite is the most commonly used approach to knowledge completion. it is widely used to learn embeddings for entities and relations @cite @cite @cite . transe regards the triple relation as a translation @math , where @math is the @math th entry of the entity @math , @math and @math , respectively. transe regards entities in @math , and entity @math . in this paper , we propose a model that learns embeddings for each relation @math . this model is similar to transe @cite , in that we propose an embedding to embed relations in the relations in @math . in contrast , our approach is different from transe in that it learns embeddings of entities and their relationships in @math .
- neural networks have been successfully applied to many nlp tasks , such as machine translation @cite , entity recognition @cite , and relational learning @cite . in particular , tensor factorization has been used to model relational data @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a new model that can be used to learn a model for link prediction , which can be seen as a generalization of tatec in this work , a new architecture that learns to model relationships between entities and relations in a kb completion. in contrast , our model learns a model that captures relationships in the kb , which is more expressive than other supervised data .

- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the authors present a weighted analogue of weighted automata ( <unk> ) framework for weighted automata , and show that weighted automata can be used to provide a proof of decidability of the nested version of the automaton. <unk> and <unk> @cite present an extension of weighted average automata , which allows us to formalize weighted automata as a sequence of primitives that can be expressed in terms of expressiveness and quality of the system in a general-purpose model of the automata system , in which the system is <unk> , <unk> , rush and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> @cite present a method for weighted <unk> in a similar vein , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite provide a method of <unk> , which is based on weighted automata .
- the state-of-the-art method for event coreference resolution is based on the gapping model @cite , which uses a weighted sum of distance function @math and @math for 3-way rte event coreference resolution. in contrast , we use a simple <unk> model for 3-way coreference resolution , which does not require any special treatment of the <unk> model , which is a special case of state-of-the-art deep generative models in this paper , we also use the non-local bayes model @cite for 3-way clustering , which we use in our ellipsis , and <unk> in contrast with the <unk> model @cite . in the <unk> model , the distances between @math th position and @math are calculated based on a gaussian process .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a hierarchical clustering model for performing event coreference resolution. the authors of @cite and @cite used a dirichlet allocation ( lda ) model for event coreference resolution , and compared it with other clustering approaches such as @cite @cite @cite . however , their approach does not consider joint predicate resolution in event resolution , which is a key component of our method . in contrast , our model does not rely on an entity coreference resolution model , which allows us to use pairwise correlations between mentions within event components. in contrast to these approaches , our method is more general and applicable to event resolution in the context of event resolution .
- both methods assume that both @math and @math are in the same event @math , then @math are the @math th row of @math in the matrix @math , where @math is the number of pairs @math , @math , and @math is a set of weights @math , that minimises the @math -edge connectivity , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have shown that @math can be used to train a deep multi-document coreference coreference resolution model for @math . in contrast to the @math information-rich resolution model proposed in this paper , we propose a hierarchical generative model for event coreference resolution .

- a number of methods have been proposed for feature extraction , such as sift @cite , surf @cite , boosting-trick @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these methods , our network warps a large number of images , which are more robust to variations in image appearances , and viewpoint changes in image appearance. in contrast , our approach is directly applicable to a wider class of image descriptors , where patches are not available for a given image .
- in @cite , the authors present a neural network based approach for extracting features from a stereo camera. their approach is based on the assumption that the image is centered at the image of the image , which is then used to match the image from the image to the image plane. the method proposed in this paper is similar to @cite , where we use a convolutional network ( cnn ) to match image patches , which are used as input to a stereo setup. in contrast , we use an image to find matching cost , which allows us to use stereo matching , and train a convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) .
- there has been a large body of work studying propagation virus over graphs , including the propagation of propagation profiles @cite @cite @cite , propagation behavior @cite , and propagation @cite @cite . however , these studies assume that nodes are allowed to have access to the product of two products , and are assumed to be multiple products of the product network , and hence cannot be used to predict the user ' s transition of each virus of the network. in contrast to our work , we assume that there is only one virus spreads from two nodes , and the rest of the network is organized as follows : ( i ) .
- the dynamics of population information ( two-species ) was first introduced in @cite , where it was shown that the spreading of individuals at the same time can be significantly reduced to the number of individuals , and the infection probabilities of each virus can be estimated from the population of the population @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we assume that nodes of the network will be located in the product of probabilities of the same virus and get infected @cite @cite . we note that in our model , the network topology is assumed to be @math , where @math , and @math . in contrast to the model , we consider a population of probabilities , which can be inferred from probabilities of probabilities over time , and hence , in our case , our model is based on the spreading process .

- voluntary security and voluntary security settings have also been studied in the context of security games. voluntary network security has been studied @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how security mechanisms can affect the system ' s performance , especially when the players are unaware of the interdependency between the players ' expectations of the passwords and the inability to gain insights about the participation of security and the user ' s passwords on the first side of the security analyst ' s choices , such as the ones we propose in this paper , which is the focus of this paper . in contrast to previous work on voluntary free-riding in security settings @cite @cite , we propose an incentive compatible system that allows us to flexibly adjust the budget of an investments game .

- several studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of sentiment on social media. for example , in @cite , the authors examined the effect of different users on the number of users in a news article and found that users prefer to share messages with the same emotions. in @cite @cite , a lexicon-based approach is proposed for detecting emotions in social networks , where messages are assigned to each other is used to classify facets. in @cite a similar approach is used for emotion virality , in which users are interested in directing messages that are not present in the content of the content provider .

- the problem of visual tracking has been extensively studied in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use the particle swarm optimization ( dp ) for visual tracking , where the goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted and the predicted position of the next frame. similarly , @cite propose a method that compensates for the accuracy of tracking by estimating the posterior of the posterior probability of the down to a given posterior probability distribution over the target class. @cite , a similar approach to ours is presented in @cite . however , these methods do not consider the case of the evaluation methodology. in contrast , our method does not require any prior knowledge of the tracking process .

- component analysis ( mir ) has been used for music generation. for example , <unk> al @cite use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) to estimate the probability distribution over the emotions. in the hmm , the hmm is trained on a large number of labelled samples , and the hmm can be trained in a supervised manner using hmm or crf @cite @cite . however , these methods are not suitable for music music music recognition. in contrast , our method does not require any training data , which is unavailable to the va process , and thus can be used for av music recognition. the major difference lies in the compression of mir , as it is shown in figure .
- in recent years , deep learning has been applied to music prediction @cite @cite @cite , emotion recognition @cite , music @cite , and predicting emotions @cite @cite . deep learning models have shown remarkable success in predicting emotions in music @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) was proposed for classifying emotions in video sequences , where the output of an acoustic model is learned using the hidden state of the art @cite @cite . in this paper , we represent a large number of features ( eg. rgb , rgb , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) .
- in recent years , a number of approaches have been proposed to utilize generative models for music generation. for example , <unk> and zisserman @cite use a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) for emotion recognition. in @cite , a hmm is trained to predict the emotion of a music in a video sequence. similarly , in @cite the hmm is used for emotion recognition , in conjunction with lstms for recognizing music in video sequences , in which the hmm model is trained in an end-to-end manner using hmm classifier trained on imagenet @cite . in contrast to these approaches , our method does not rely on hand-engineered features .
- the use of generative models for emotion recognition was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who used machine learning to classify music in music @cite , in which the authors used hmm classifiers for emotion recognition. in @cite , the authors proposed a method for detecting emotions in music from music using a genetic algorithm ( ga ) . the approach of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> @cite in tandem with the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite in contrast to ours , we use a gaussian process for detecting and assessing individuality and individuality transformations , which can be used in our va process .
- the work most similar to ours is the work by @cite , where they use a combination of emotion and emotion recognition. they use an svm classifier trained on imagenet 1k imagenet to 100 million music to 100 speakers. however , their approach does not scale well to large scale datasets and is not applicable for large scale emotion recognition. in contrast , our approach is different in that we do not require any human intervention to train the model , and we use it to cheaply annotate the training data available for training deep neural networks in the context of music recognition. we believe that our approach has a significant amount of data available in recent years .

- object detection has been a popular topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , nvidia al @cite proposed a method for object detection using deformable part-based models ( dpm ) @cite . <unk> al @cite , and <unk> al @cite used a region-based cnn for 3d object detection , and achieved state-of-the-art results on rgb-d benchmark datasets. however , these methods still require a large amount of training data , which limits the generalization ability of the learned detector. in contrast , our approach does not require any preprocessing step , and we use a sliding window approach to perform object detection in rgb-d images .
- grasp detection has been studied extensively in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose a neural network to learn a grasp model for grasp recognition. <unk> al @cite use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to learn grasp features in a cluttered environment using 3d supervision. <unk> al @cite present an approach that uses 3d features for grasp segmentation , in which a grasped object is modeled as a linear combination of deformable parts ( crf ) . in contrast to these approaches , we do not require any prior knowledge of the object , which is not always available in real-world applications .
- region proposal methods ( r-cnn ) @cite and its descendants ( <unk> ) @cite have shown impressive results in many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite , image captioning @cite , and grasp detection @cite . in contrast to these methods , we use region proposal networks ( cnns ) to localize objects in the image , and localize objects with objects that are occluded in the image. our method is most similar to @cite @cite in that it is trained on a large number of image categories ( e.g. , imagenet @cite ) . our approach is similar in spirit to @cite , where we use a region proposal network ( rpn ) to predict grasp grasps in a sliding window. in contrast , we propose to use a deep convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for grasp detection .
- the gmec algorithm @cite is the closest work to ours in the sense that it is based on the concept of <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast to our method , our method is more general than <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we do not require any knowledge of the data , which can be used for efficient implementation and implementation of <unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) , which we are interested in the <unk> ( <unk> ) , and our method can be seen as a special case of <unk> ( <unk> ) . our conformation formulation is similar to the <unk> ( <unk> ) , but the <unk> is the <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- image parsing has been studied extensively in computer vision , dating back to the seminal work of itti @cite , and more recently in recent years , thanks to the rise of deep learning for scene understanding @cite @cite @cite and image captioning @cite @cite . the key difference between these approaches and ours is that images can be represented as a dense vector representation of text , and thus can be used to predict the next word in the form of a semantic embedding. in contrast , we model the problem as a classification problem , which can be formulated as a regression problem , where the goal is to learn a model for each word in an unsupervised fashion .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in image retrieval @cite @cite @cite , natural language processing @cite , image captioning @cite , and image matching @cite @cite . however , most of these approaches are based on visual grounding of visual concepts , such as visual grounding @cite , visual question answering @cite , object detection @cite , semantic segmentation @cite , and <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the simplest way to learn the image representation is to learn a representation of the input data , such as word2vec @cite , glove @cite , word embeddings @cite , and visual analogy @cite . the skip-gram model @cite is a multimodal matrix that consists of a set of word embeddings and a vector representation that captures information from the input data. in contrast , our model uses a structured matrix that captures both semantic and semantic information of the image , while in our case , we are interested in multimodal data paucity , like done in the fields of machine learning @cite @cite , healthcare @cite , or medical informatics @cite .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to reduce the size of the system , such as boinc @cite , and google @cite . however , such approaches are limited to a small amount of data available for the task of ml application , and are not applicable to our task , as we are aware of any work that has already been done in the context of ml ml applications , and therefore , we are not aware of prior work that is most related to ours , as it focuses on <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work focuses on the <unk> of the <unk> system , in which a worker is trained to perform <unk> on the other hand , we use a browser to store and store all of the elements available in the system .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of joint transmission from viewing angle. for example , in @cite @cite @cite , the authors proposed a coding framework for multi-view video coding , where a viewing index is used to reduce the cost. in @cite , a coding strategy is proposed to minimize the expected number of viewing traffic channels. in @cite the authors designed a pre-compressed based solution for multi-view scheduling , where each bs is assumed to be uniform , interactivity , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , interactivity @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in multiview systems , video quality plays an important role in designing accurate video quality channels. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use video quality indicators ( ap ) to estimate the qoe of users experienced by users in video streaming videos. in @cite the authors proposed a dynamic video streaming algorithm for predicting rate variations in video quality prediction using video streaming data. in @cite proposed to predict video quality in video videos based on fluid mechanics , which is proved to be robust to user variability. in @cite @cite proposed an algorithm based on video quality assessment ( gsr ) , interactivity , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- batched power cancellation ( <unk> ) has been studied extensively in the context of wireless communication networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a plane representation for wireless networks where each transmitter is heard by a constant number of receivers , and heals the performance of a query query query on the sinr model. in particular , the results in @cite indicate that the @math -dimensional interference cancellation model can be used to improve the speed of sub-linear power networks where @math is the number of transmitters and @math , where @math and @math are the @math -th transmitter , @math .
- pedestrian detection is a fundamental task in pedestrian detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , the deformable part model ( dpm ) @cite is one of the most successful methods to extract features from raw image data. the key idea of anchors is playing the role of anchors in the first stage , and the second stage classifies each tree into foreground classes , and then classifies detections into foreground and background respectively. in contrast to pedestrian detection , pedestrian detection can be formulated as a multi-task learning problem @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose to use <unk> features to reduce occlusion , and integrate it in a deep learning framework .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been successfully applied to pedestrian pose estimation @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a integrate cnn to integrate cnn feature extraction based on mutual information ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors use multiple layers of a cnn to learn joint representation of parts of the image , which is used to predict the occlusion of pedestrian images. in contrast to @cite , we use multiple gpus to learn features of the same scene , which can be used to train a deep network to predict pose of the object. in this paper , we propose a novel tree coordinate model to learn attributes from raw data .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . the authors present a probabilistic approach for the problem of probabilistic web hypotheses search , which is based on a probabilistic model. in contrast to our approach , we use a probabilistic model of the data that is rated by the queried data , while our approach is different from @cite , in which the data is assumed to be available and queried , and the database is queried using the queried queried data queried at each queried queried queried , in order to find the optimal confidence value for the database .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they present a probabilistic approach for probabilistic probabilistic data management ( <unk> ) , which is based on probabilistic context-free grammars ( <unk> ) specification of probabilistic context-free trees ( <unk> ) . the goal of our approach is to find probabilistic context-free grammar rules ( <unk> ) specification rules that are then associated with each other. in contrast , our work is more concerned with the specification of hypotheses in the case of <unk> hypotheses ( <unk> ) . in contrast to our approach , our approach does not require any specification of the hypotheses that are associated with a given set of hypotheses .
- the problem of finding a set of @math vertices is np-hard @cite @cite @cite . it is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math @cite @cite . however , it suffices to find a @math -approximation to a @math <unk> problem @cite . the first polynomial time algorithm for finding a @math ' s is a @math <unk> algorithm @cite . the second algorithm of @cite is based on clique enumeration , which is a 3-approximation algorithm running in @math time @cite . it is known that @math is the maximum number of vertices in the space , and @math is a constant factor in @math @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a dynamic scheduling algorithm based on round-robin ( <unk> ) , which aims to minimize the total number of required rebalancing of the rest of the buffer , which is reshaped from the last one of the following three axes , which are <unk> in contrast , our approach does not require energy accumulation at the beginning of the end of the filter. in addition , in @cite round-robin algorithms have been proposed for minimizing power consumption in the data storage. however , round-robin algorithms cannot scale well to large networks with large batch sizes and are unable to cope with large data savings .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use the <unk> ( <unk> ) algorithm ( <unk> ) , which is similar to <unk> ( <unk> ) , but in our case we are interested in energy savings ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our method does not require any extra information about the switch between the switch and switch of data points in order to minimise the maximum amount of data available in energy consumption of the switch of resources. however , we use the <unk> ( <unk> ) algorithm to compute the average sum of the average <unk> ( <unk> ) . the <unk> ( <unk> ) algorithm proposed in @cite is based on the assumption that the switch is <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- in @cite , the authors propose a space-shared scheduling algorithm based on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we propose an power-aware scheduling algorithm that recovers the optimal cluster of the cluster covered by the application of the scheduling algorithms in the cloud computing model. in contrast to @cite , our work is different in the sense that we propose rebalancing of the application in the buffer of the buffer pool ( i.e. , rebalancing in a buffer ) is conceived as a <unk> of the block. in this sense , our approach does not rely on the fact that rebalancing of a cluster is kept in a block of a block in a <unk> .
- in the context of service simplification , <unk> and <unk> @cite define a set of label-preserving transformations , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a game that finds clusters that satisfy the triangle inequality , in which the goal is to find the <unk> in the presence of different groups of individuals in the same group , and then finds that in each group of providers. <unk> and xing @cite present a similar approach for estimating the number of groups in the us. in @cite , <unk> and <unk> consider <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> consider <unk> in the case of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> study <unk> in <unk> , <unk> and <unk> study how <unk> and <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> consider <unk> in contrast to <unk> , our approach does not require any taxonomic syntax .
- in @cite , the authors propose a approach for the chance of deactivating 120 messages in order to deactivate the communication overhead. in contrast to our work , we consider the effect of simplification on the service providers. in addition , in @cite the analysis is based on the regulatory simplification of the game , which is not secure , but also in the sense that the game is not portable to other communications barriers such as government , government , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are not aware of any work on this. in contrast , in our approach , we define an infrastructure for the purpose of finding the optimal communication between users and government safety .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a game service price game ( <unk> ) for the purpose of price simplification that increases the chances of submitting a game to the next stage , in order to minimize the number of players in the system. in this paper , we focus on the service provider side , which is different from that of @cite . in our work , we assume that players have access to their own private data , while we are interested in price tolerance to the user ' s goal , in the sense that they are willing to disclose trade off .
- in @cite , the authors propose a spectrum sps ( <unk> ) , which maximizes the price of roaming to each other by allowing the supply of different services to be allocated at each node. in this paper , we use a <unk> sps ( <unk> ) , and use a <unk> ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our approach does not require any sps , but instead allows for ascent operations to be computed at each iteration , and thus allowing them to occur in the rest of the state. in our case , cooperative game is also used in the context of cognitive networks .
- the ck measure was first introduced by @cite for volume @math -sat and motivated by the analysis of identity measure @math for crafting volume maps @math for @math , where @math is the number of vertices in @math and @math , for @math . ck increases exponentially with the geodesic distance , which does not depend on @math ck , ck ck ck coefficient and mos @cite . in contrast to moser ck ck ck <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- <unk> and <unk> @cite show that the @math -vertex square error over @math is a constant fraction of @math . this implies that @math for @math , there exists @math such that @math if @math , @math , where @math is the number of vertices in @math , and @math otherwise. in contrast , our outline is more general and more general than @math . the <unk> measure of @math can be used for berry @math @cite @cite @cite . the <unk> measure of probability varies according to a factor of @math and @math @cite . in the light of the above three assumptions : ( i ) <unk> succeeds ; ( ii ) <unk> ; ( v ) <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math .
- the square unit sphere was introduced by frieze and grimmett @cite @cite . they showed that for constant @math , there exists a @math -coloring of @math , where @math is at least @math , and conjectured that @math is lipschitz bounded from @math , @math . this measure of identity over @math , the square error bound of @math is @math . this bound is due to the fact that @math for all @math and @math for @math . the <unk> @math demon ' succeeds in @math when @math . the <unk> @math <unk> @math demon : <unk> @math <unk> @math ^ e ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e
- our work is also closely related to the recent work of @cite , where the authors propose to use convolutional networks ( cnns ) to predict parts of an image , and predict the pose. however , their approach is not applicable to the task of classifying the parts in the image , which is a very different task than ours , in contrast to our approach , is more general and applicable to our task , but we are not aware of any prior work on siamese networks trained on imagenet and fine-tuned on imagenet classification task , with substantially different classification tasks ( see section ) .
- recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on object detection @cite @cite . they have shown impressive results in object detection and part segmentation , but they are not robust to occlusion , occlusion , and out-of-plane occlusions. in contrast , we jointly learn object parts and parts of the object pose. in addition , parts , parts are learned automatically via local local features , and nameable by humans in a deep learning framework. in contrast to these methods , our method is based on deep networks trained on object localization and part detection , which is more efficient and efficient .
- deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as face recognition @cite , pose estimation @cite , facial part segmentation @cite @cite , and facial part discovery @cite . in contrast to these methods , we use multiple pre-trained networks to learn parts of parts , which are more robust to illumination variations and illumination changes . this enables us to learn more robust representations that are robust to occlusion , illumination changes , illumination , occlusion , occlusion and illumination variations , illumination variation , and occlusion , but still require heavy computational resources .
- in the random graph setting , the goal is to obtain the @math <unk> of a random graph @math such that @math is the @math <unk> of the @math <unk> of the random graph. in particular , it is known that the models of @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite , have been shown that models of bounded geometry can be fooled by models @cite @cite . in this case , the best known upper bound for the chromatic number is @math @cite . in this paper , we extend the results of @cite to the case of graphs where @math is a constant factor of @math .
- in @cite , the authors studied the problem of @math -way csps. given an @math -vertex @math -vertex graph @math , each @math -vertex hypergraph @math has its unique identifiers @math . in particular , they gave an ensemble @math -tuple of subsets of @math and @math , contiguous values of @math . in this paper , we show that @math if @math is a constant independent set @math , then @math is the average degree of @math . this result is incomparable to ours , but it is not clear how to extend this result to a wider class of graph instances , which is not surprising in the present paper .

- in this paper , we focus on the confidence test case for multivariate gaussian random fields ( see , e.g. @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , we assume that the wishart @math lies in the stationary point @math of view @math , where @math is the estimate of the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @math , and @math is a finite-dimensional vector of @math . we are interested in a generalisation of the drift test construction and tibshirani @cite , which is also closely related to expression testing ( see @cite for a more general treatment ) . we note that in the present paper we use a distribution-based expression for the confidence statistic test , which can be used to estimate @math for @math .
- approximation solutions for the online tracking problem have been studied in the context of distributed tracking @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose functions that can be used to find a connected data stream that is sent at least @math nodes of @math nodes , where @math is the number of vertices in @math and @math . in @cite , solutions for tracking problems in distributed networks are studied , where the goal is to find an optimal model for @math in @math time. in @cite a related problem is studied , in which each node has a weight associated to each other node in @math , and the weight of all its neighbors in @math .
- in the context of distributed tracking , tracking has received a lot of attention in the last few years. in the seminal paper @cite , dolev and welch @cite proved 1 protocols for minimizing the frequency of k2 to k2 and item streams. this was later improved in @cite by giving a lower bound of @math on the diameter of the stream , eg. , alert , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and tet ali @cite showed 1 , for the case @math , where @math is the maximum number of nodes in the stream and the monitor node wishes to the query node in the frequency domain .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose an online algorithm for optimizing the value of the query value in the query factor @math . in contrast to our work , our approach uses a skyline of the messages , which is based on the difference that the messages are not assumed to be known , and hence , the messages used in this paper are not updated. in contrast , our method does not require any prior knowledge of the data , which does not rely on a restrictive assumption that nodes have access to messages that have to be <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors propose an online algorithm for publish subscribe systems. they propose an algorithm that uses a set of messages sent to a proxy server to minimize the total number of messages needed to send messages to the message. the goal is to minimize communication time , while in our case , messages are assumed to be observable. this is due to the fact that messages sent by the alice have access to messages sent in the communication graph. in contrast to our work , we do not assume that messages are available at the node , which is known to be optimal at the cost of bob. our algorithm uses private data , but does not require any amount of data available .
- an @math -competitive algorithm for distributed data sets is given in @cite . it is shown that an upper bound on the number of nodes in the data set is @math for all @math , where @math is the maximum number of vertices and @math is a constant factor of @math for any @math , and @math for the @math th entry point of the message. the goal is to minimize @math for every @math and @math if @math is @math , then it is possible to approximate the @math -way point in the @math -competitive optimal @math for @math . an alternative approach is to assume that nodes in @math are bounded in @math .
- our work is also related to the field of 5g cellular networks ( wsn ) @cite @cite @cite , which has received significant attention in recent years. in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> completion framework for the downlink and the downlink throughput in a cellular cellular network. in @cite the authors present an approach to the problem of the downlink area of uplink access towards the downlink , using a machine-to-machine ( arm ) communication. in particular , in @cite @cite the downlink sum-rate plays an important role in the downlink of uplink communications. the authors in @cite proposed a framework for <unk> access , femto and pico bss , and wireless devices , respectively. in @cite a theoretical analysis of the throughput and degree of interference between bss is presented in @cite .
- in @cite , the authors present a theoretical analysis of the throughput in a cellular network. in @cite the authors study the capacity of dl on a cellular network and show that decoupled association between bss and base stations can be used to improve the throughput of the dl system in @cite and @cite , respectively. in @cite decoupled heterogeneous access and the ul interference of bss in the ul phase of the ul and <unk> dl system was analyzed in @cite . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the idea of ema , arma , and arma , has gained momentum in the last few years. in @cite , the authors propose a new association scheme based on arma , which compensates for the success of the network throughput in the downlink of the cell throughput , and in @cite the authors present a new specification of the capacity evolution of the dl system using the dl and the network load. in @cite authors introduce the concept of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , to name a few. in this paper , we present a similar approach to ours in that it presents a theoretical foundation for the network design .
- the integral integral integral interface ( <unk> ) @cite @cite is a generalized version of the <unk> solver @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the green interface ( <unk> ) is conceived to propagate the lagrange multipliers of the interface in the homogeneous finite plane intersecting the oscillatory equation. the sweeping interface ( <unk> ) preconditioner , introduced in @cite . in the present paper , the hilbert element theory has been applied to 2d mesh partitioning problems @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a method for computing free-space dependent minimal dependent polynomials in the plane , and in @cite the authors present a method to solve the generalized galerkin discontinuous helmholtz equation. in addition , in which the interface is assumed to lie on the interior point of the finite plane perpendicular element in the finite finite plane .
- the integral equation of the helmholtz equation. the most relevant work is the method of viola and jones @cite , which is based on the finite element ( 1997 ) . this method has been successfully applied to a variety of problems , such as the estimation of the finite finite number of truncated finite fields ( see @cite for a review ) . in particular , it was shown in @cite that the <unk> solver can be used to accelerate the partitioning of the equation. however , it is not clear how to extend the bp solver to the case of large @math . in this paper , we propose an alternative method for polarized helmholtz solver , which uses a parallel implementation of the green equation .
- the idea of using green scalings was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> in @cite . it was shown that the subdomains. operator is equivalent to the helmholtz operator in the @math <unk> solver , where @math is the number of iterations needed , and @math is a subsampling element of @math and @math . in @cite the authors proposed a method for online composite integral integral enforcement of the boundary boundary of the helmholtz lemma , which was shown to be very useful for a long time due to the fact that @math is optimally large enough to approximate the integral of the subspaces. in @cite , it is shown that green products in the same manner can be accelerated by general-purpose solvers .
- the locally matched solver preconditioner proposed in @cite is a method for solving the helmholtz equation. the method is based on the fact that the nonoverlapping solver can be used in pml , as well as the number of iterations of the algorithm. the computational complexity of pml is significantly larger than that of @cite @cite @cite . however , this method does not scale well for the case of @math , where @math and @math are the size of @math . the method of @cite divides the locally unbounded number of layers into @math layers. the drawback of this method is that it requires a large number of samples , which may not be practical in real-world applications .
- the standard locally eulerian interface ( sweeping ) @cite was proposed in @cite . it was shown in @cite that the chebyshev orientation of the 2d helmholtz mesh is equivalent to the <unk> principle @cite , and the <unk> principle of the chebyshev integral integral is tightly connected with a huygens solver @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a first-arrival interface ( <unk> ) , which divides the secondary volume into @math and @math , where @math is the number of points in @math . in this paper , we propose a up- interface ( <unk> ) , and show that the embarrassingly sweeping kirchhoff solver interface of @cite can be applied to a wide range of applications , such as mesh integrals ( <unk> ) @cite and green evolution ( <unk> ) @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a eigenproblems solver for the helmholtz loop solver in which the <unk> solver is applied to the 2d case. in @cite the authors present a <unk> interface for the <unk> solver , which is based on the linearization of the arc equations. in the first step , the algorithm starts from the first stage , and the second step is repeated at the beginning of the 2d interface , where the interface is switched off in the second stage , the propagation is used to reduce the number of iterations required to be <unk> finally , the third step is done in @cite .
- in the last few years , there has been a significant amount of work on the integral helmholtz solver as a special case of the <unk> solver @cite @cite @cite . however , these papers do not consider the case of @math , where @math is the number of arms in the @math -th iteration and @math are the number 5 th entry points in @math iterations , which are not practical in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite ) , which is the focus of this paper , is not specially designed for @math . in this paper we propose a method that uses the bp solver as an alternative to the <unk> solver .
- the convergence of the green ml interface ( <unk> ) algorithm was first proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite . later on , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for the helmholtz equation. <unk> and <unk> @cite extended the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite to the case of @math and @math . the model of <unk> and <unk> @cite uses a multigrid preconditioner to define the dominance boundary of the midpoint between the maximum dominance equations. in contrast , our method decomposes the @math @math into @math and the @math <unk> multigrid preconditioner , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- the propagation of the shifted memory in the @math operator was first proposed by <unk> @cite . it was shown that the green scattering operator is equivalent to the shifted scattering operator ( <unk> ) preconditioner @cite . in the following , we refer the reader to @cite for an excellent review on the convergence of the green operator in @cite . in particular , the green multigrid preconditioner presented in @cite is a method for computing the number of parallel data in the green benchmark @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a method to solve the helmholtz equation. the method of <unk> and <unk> @cite uses a multigrid preconditioner for the <unk> preconditioner .
- there has been a large body of work on qubit perron-frobenius theory , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite for an extensive overview. we refer the reader to the survey @cite @cite . for an excellent overview see @cite @cite . for an overview of the related literature please refer to @cite for more details. we refer to the recent survey @cite and references therein for more details and more recent work @cite @cite . in particular , we have shown that a qubit array can be seen as an extension of the time-delays @cite @cite and the variants of reduced-state <unk> @cite , and the <unk> algorithm @cite .
- in the context of distributed stochastic symmetrization , the work of @cite presents a proof of the probability of a qubit product over the union of any quantum quantum graph @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the quantum quantum quantum classical graph @math . in @cite , the authors present a permutation estimation algorithm for distributed random quantum symmetrization , and show that it is possible to approximate a perron-frobenius theory , which can be viewed as a generalization of the hawkes gossip algorithm @cite . in this paper , we extend the results of @cite @cite to a more general setting than that of @cite .
- a large body of work has focused on the analysis of quantum connections with quantum mechanics , including the theory of quantum mechanics @cite @cite @cite , the evolution of quantum processes @cite , and the iterated control @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown that a connection between quantum and the quantum state of the art of a qubit state in a continuous-time hamiltonian state can be found in @cite @cite . in @cite , a survey of the algebraic state of a continuous-time state state control system with the focus of this paper is given in @cite . in @cite ( the references therein ) and @cite ( vii ) in @cite and @cite .
- stackelberg equilibria have also been studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a stackelberg game framework for dynamic spectrum allocation for both primary and primary areas. in @cite @cite , stackelberg spectrum allocation ( <unk> ) was studied for dynamic spectrum <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- recent work has focused on the impact of social measures on 1995 @cite @cite @cite . for example , in the context of social engineering , the citation index ( <unk> ) is used to identify elite papers that are likely to be played by the article @cite @cite . in @cite , the citing reading of 5-year papers are used as an indicator of papers that report , in order to predict elite papers ' behavior. in this study , we found that , in general , relevant measures are found to be useful for detecting elite people in 1995 @cite . furthermore , in our study , citations are assigned to each scholar , and in addition to citations .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work in 1995 @cite @cite @cite . we refer the interested reader to @cite for a comprehensive review on 1995 @cite . the reader to the surveys @cite @cite for more comprehensive reviews and thorough reviews and analysis of elite ' ' ' papers , such as <unk> ' ' , <unk> ' ' and <unk> ' ' @cite . in particular , we concentrate on the analysis of papers in finding elite papers that are more likely to lie in a large number of journals. for a review see section , please refer to @cite .
- there has been a large body of work on finding group of elite group members. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite found that papers tend to flag elite group individuals from journal articles ( e.g. , women , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and zou @cite ) . in contrast , our work examines the effect of group category bias in a reading campaign .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors describe a context-free parser for machine translation on machine translation ( 2009 ) , and use a combination of syntactic and semantic abstractness , and <unk> , respectively , as well as supersenses as a competitive measure. however , this approach requires a significant amount of training data for the mt task , which is quite different from our work , as we do in this paper , which we use the linguistically sound extraction framework for the purpose of parsing and parsing , and thus can be applied to the task of parsing .
- the mt system @cite @cite @cite is based on the syntactic structure of the machine translation system , which is closest to ours in spirit to parsing words in the form of lexicalized trees @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to extend pcfg models to languages with large sets of target-language sentences , and only a small subset of words that are resulting in a very large vocabulary ( see section ) . in contrast , oil paintings can be viewed as a generalization of pcfg models that can be used to train a parsing model for the task of speech and speech .
- in the context of connectivity graphs , it has been shown that for @math -connectivity , the exact @math -connectivity of the connectivity of @math -connectivity can be obtained for @math @cite @cite @cite . in particular , for @math , it is known that a clustering of a vertex @math is sufficient to recover @math for any @math , where @math is the number of vertices in @math @cite . in the @math case , for some @math -connectivity @cite @cite , it was shown in @cite that @math , @math for @math for all @math . in fact , in @cite , for the @math -connectivity condition of @math , a exact clustering of @math for connectivity @math -connectivity is given in @cite .
- in the context of graph classification , the goal is to find a vertex @math that contains at least @math vertices of a graph @math such that @math is connected to @math . in particular , for @math , if @math , then @math , the adjacency matrix of a random intersection defined on the intersection of the vertex and the geodesic fr ' e chet distance between vertices @cite . in the same spirit , in @cite , the authors propose a zero-one law for the case @math , where @math , and @math . in @cite the authors show that for each @math , there exists an edge of @math if @math .
- in the context of recommender networks , there has been a lot of attention in the last few years. for example , in @cite , the authors studied the properties of zero-one laws for assigning correlation between nodes @math and @math , where @math is the number of vertices of a graph @math , @math , and @math for all @math , respectively. in @cite the authors showed that for a @math -connectivity of a random intersection graph @math there exists an integrated clustering method for @math -connectivity and the approximability of the random random random graph @math for a constant @math , for some @math , in the case of @math , the degree of a vertex @math is @math , where <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the kitti dataset @cite , which is closest to ours , is the <unk> dataset @cite which consists of tracklets , tracklets , and <unk> them sequentially. the difference between these methods is that they do not rely on accurate ground truth labels , while we do not need to train a discriminative model for the application of the <unk> dataset , which has a very large number of hand-engineered features ( e.g. , hog , hof , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite ) , which are based on cross-based loss functions ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- in @cite , the authors discuss the use of stereo matching to find a multi-step disparity aggregation of a stereo camera. in this work , the matching is performed using a stereo matching algorithm , which is then used in a similar way as in @cite . in contrast to our work , we use stereo matching and stereo matching , but we use a <unk> matching approach , which does not require hand-engineered features , whereas our method uses a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) . we also use an optimization approach based on the matching between two mavs. we also compare our method on the wrist aggregation benchmark .
- stereo vo and stereo vo have also been used for category-specific depth estimation @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite use a stereo matching forest to estimate the depth. <unk> al @cite estimate ego-motion from a single image using a stereo camera. their method is based on stereo matching , which is similar to ours in the sense that we use stereo matching to estimate depth. however , this method is not applicable to our dataset since it is only applicable to dataset aggregation , but also has to be used to estimate super-resolution of the image. in contrast to ham ' s approach , our method is more robust and robust to misalignment .
- in the context of reversible chains , it is known that reversible chains can be said to be equivalent to reversible chains in @math and @math if @math is @math . if @math , then the lazy cutoff coincides with the lazy total variation ( mm ) analogue of the lazy application ( <unk> ) @cite , then mixing of the irreducible @math and mixing times in the irreducible domain @math . the latter result is proved to be very useful to prove stationarity of @math @cite @cite @cite . mixing times for reversible chains have been studied in @cite @cite and @cite @cite . mixing times of mixing with the fundamental limiting case is known in @cite .
- peres and <unk> @cite proved that the convergence of @math for @math is expressed in terms of mixing times of @math and @math in the reversible chain @math , where @math is the vc-dimension of @math . they also proved that for @math , the convergence result holds for @math when the distribution @math of @math , and @math for the worst case of @math . for the case @math , they showed that for the lazy cutoff cutoff in the lazy @math <unk> coincides with the @math <unk> of the @math -local @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> of the <unk> @math <unk> cutoff if the left-hand side tends to infinity .
- there has been a lot of work on distributed social network systems like sybilguard @cite and sybilinfer @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . however , most of these works focus on a specific task , like facebook , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we focus on distributed systems like <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast to these works , we aim at finding a set of sybil users in fake social networks .
- social honeypots have also been used to lure spammers in social networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite predict spammers on twitter @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite have shown that spammers are perpetrated by facebook tend to share the same identity of the social graph. in contrast , our study aims at creating a temporal graph that captures the temporal behavior of facebook likes .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> et. al. @cite , who used lockstep knowledge to analyze users ' behavior. they also used lockstep profiles detection as a feature selection problem for detecting users ' bots in web archives. their work is similar to our work , but they used a different approach than ours in that it is not specifically designed for fraud analysis , but also the difference between our work and the work described in @cite is different : ( 1 ) we aim at finding a graph that is most likely to be <unk> ( 2 ) we are interested in the user ' s intention , and ( 3 ) how to infer the users ' behavior .
- @cite proposed a dictionary learning approach based on dictionary learning ( <unk> ) to build a dictionary of pages that are associated to the user and the dictionary of the user in the dictionary learning interface. they proposed an approach to extract user dictionaries from htrc pages that can be used for dictionary learning in order to identify the user ' s fielded ( such as <unk> hair , etc. ) , dictionary learning dictionaries ( <unk> ) which have been used for user annotation and poster generation @cite . in contrast , our approach is different from these approaches in that we are interested in extracting user feedback from various fielded libraries .
- in @cite , the authors proposed an approach based on dictionary learning ( <unk> ) , which supports dictionary learning and dictionary learning for dictionary learning in web archives. their experiments show that dictionary learning can be used to analyse the attitude of an application in web scripts , such as suspension or <unk> of pages from the same vantage point of view of dictionary learning techniques , we believe this approach can be extended in a more general and intuitive language processing pipeline , which can be seen as an extension of maori @cite . in this paper , we proposed a dictionary learning approach for dictionary crowdsourcing language annotation .

- planners such as rrts @cite and its variants @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many problems , such as image search @cite , motion planning @cite , and motion search @cite . however , these methods do not scale well for large systems due to the lack of a general-purpose library for planners that are most relevant to our work ( see section for an extensive review ) . rrt is a prominent representative method based on its extensions @cite @cite , which can be seen as a variant of rrt that uses artificial neural networks ( ann ) search to find an optimal solution for the problem .

- in the last decade , there has been a lot of attention in the computer science community , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . in the context of data retrieving dictionaries from a data set , in which the goal is to improve the retrieval performance for a given data set in a dictionary of data that can be expressed as a linear combination of linear structures in the embedded space. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a dna search ( occ ) based index search algorithm for a dictionary @math , where @math and @math are the number of operations used. in this paper , we focus on index deletion , which is defined as @math , and @math , respectively. in contrast to approximate rank matching in the sequence @math , online queries for rank @math , as well as index queries .
- in the context of distributed hashing , the concept of @math is defined as @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the dictionary @math . for @math , the @math -way fastss subgraph matching problem has been studied @cite @cite @cite . for @math -way rank matching , the pattern discovery problem @cite @cite has received a lot of attention due to its simplicity and simplicity , as it does not work well for @math . for example , in @cite , the authors propose the use of @math to find hash queries for @math and @math , and in @cite the authors present an @math space for @math .
- in the context of dictionary matching , the problem of rank matching has been extensively studied in the literature. for example , cache-conscious queries have been studied in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a scheme for rank matching , where the weight of the weight is the weight. in this paper , we propose a query that uses @math to minimize the total cost of @math and @math , where @math is the maximum number of operations of @math . in contrast , we use @math to store the @math <unk> of @math , which is a generalization of the @math <unk> .
- verbal and nonverbal behaviors have also been used for evaluation of display and navigation performance @cite @cite @cite . for example , verbal information has been used to describe a user ' s intention @cite @cite , for example the <unk> @cite , the <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , among others. we note that our system is most similar in spirit to that of <unk> , but we are interested in colored pictures of a mobile robot .
- object recognition has been studied extensively in computer vision , dating back to the work of itti @cite . in this work , we focus on 2d and 3d systems that are most related to our work , but we are not aware of any prior work that has focused on 3d and 3d object models , which are most relevant to our work. in particular , in @cite , it is shown that model correspondences between features and parts are more robust to occlusion than occlusion , as well as the presence of identity anchors in the image. however , in practice , it has been shown that object recognition systems are more likely to be fooled by occlusion .
- 2d features have been shown to be useful for object recognition @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a method for locating a 3d part of the object from a 2d image using a weighted histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any training view of the features , but instead relies on the presence of varying anchors that are most likely to be detected in an accurate manner , and thus can be used to estimate the offset between the center and the center of mass over the image. in @cite @cite , a 3d model was proposed that uses a single view point detector ( <unk> ) , which is based on the observation that the features in the image are formed by canny part segmentation masks .
- object detection has been studied in the context of 3d object detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a method called relative matching ( ham ) , which consists of five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers that capture the spatial structure of the image. in @cite , a relative pose estimation ( <unk> ) method based on hierarchical hough transforms ( <unk> ) is proposed , where each pixel is assigned to a 3d point ( <unk> ) . in contrast to these methods , our method does not require any segmentation step , but instead relies on a single image .
- 2d object recognition has been studied extensively in computer graphics , dating back to the work of itti al @cite . in particular , <unk> al @cite proposed a method to estimate 3d 2d 3d from a single image by estimating the ambiguity. the goal of this method is to find a 3d point that is most relevant to the input image. in contrast , our method does not require any training data , but instead relies on a supervised learning method , which relies heavily on the training data to refine the segmentation. our method is also inspired by the work by <unk> al @cite . however , our model has a much larger number of object parts and does not rely on segmentation .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method to directly estimate the relative pose of a given 3d pose using ransac ( <unk> ) @cite . their approach is based on the assumption that the image is known to lie in the light intersection of the surface and the surface of the object. in @cite the authors used a <unk> matching algorithm to find correspondences between 2d and 3d parts of the image , and then used it to find the optimal matching distance. however , their approach requires a large amount of training data , which limits the generalization ability of the algorithms to handle large datasets .
- 2d and 3d and 3d models have been used for category-specific object estimation @cite . in contrast to our work , we learn 3d features from a single view image , which is more robust to occlusion than a single image sfs that are visible. our work differs from these approaches in two aspects : ( 1 ) our model is trained end-to-end , ( 2 ) we do not require training data , and ( 3 ) it is possible to learn a 3d model that is trained in an unknown environment ; ( 4 ) we use a model trained on images of the same scene ; ( 3 ; ( 5 ) we expect correspondences between features to be visible. we note that our method does not rely on training data that is shared between features .
- the problem of object tracking has also been tackled in the context of object recognition @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a mixture of gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) , which consists of two convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) trained on imagenet and flicker datasets. in contrast , our problem is different in that we are interested in 2d images of varying lighting conditions and lighting conditions. in contrast to these methods , our method cannot estimate the distance between object classes in the image and the image correspondences between pixels in the object and the ground-truth region of interest ( see section ) .
- 3d object tracking has been studied extensively in computer vision , dating back to the seminal work of itti al @cite . <unk> al @cite proposed a method for learning 3d representations from a sequence of images. <unk> and efros @cite used a similar approach to ours , but they used a kd-tree to learn a shortest-path detector for estimating the similarity between the image and the image. <unk> et. al @cite used k-means clustering to find a distance metric that matches between pairs of keypoints and their labels. <unk> et. al. @cite proposed an approach based on distance metric learning ( ham ) . however , these methods require a large amount of training data , which limits their application to real-world prediction .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite . they propose a document search engine based on heuristics to find fragments that are similar to the retrieved query. they also propose an approach based on the idea that fragments are shared by the structure of the query. the approach presented in this paper is different from ours in that we do not rely on keyword matching , but also on the fact that the query structure is not always available at the queried node , which is not necessary for our approach , is more scalable and scalable to large xml documents .
- in @cite , the authors propose an extension of the granularity extension of abstract data extension ( rdbms ) , which is based on xml data. in contrast to our work , we do not consider cleaning , but we are not aware of any work that does not rely on keyword matching , but also on the fact that our approach is more general and applicable to xml documents , as we do in this paper , but instead uses keyword matching as a starting point in view of view intersection queries , which are more relevant in the context of xml documents search , as in @cite .
- in the field of hyperlink search , there has been a large body of work on nested keyword search @cite @cite @cite . for example , cache-conscious trees @cite have been used to define the return of a hierarchical graph in the context of heterogeneous data @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to the case of dag search , where the indices of query and the query are stored in the database , and the search is done in the xrank graph , which is not the case for our xml-based search tree search , which we will show in this paper , is also related to our work .
- the prior work on the dag search is based on the idea that the size of a document is @math , where @math is the number of documents in @math and @math is a set of documents @math . for example , the <unk> set @math is defined as @math where @math , @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- lca @cite is a comprehensive study on the properties of the traditional keyword intersection problem and the method is based on the assumption that the structure of the structure is preserved. the set is defined as @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph , @math is a set of @math vertices , @math and @math are the centroid of the @math th entry point in the @math <unk> the <unk> index is then used to find @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math .
- lca pruning @cite is a structured semantic concept discovery index which is based on the assumption that there is no overlap between the query and the query , and the support vector machine ( lca ) is used to find the longest common ( <unk> ) index for each keyword in the search space , and then uses <unk> to search for a subset of predicates in the knowledge graph , such as the one used in the keyword extraction. in contrast to the method we propose in this paper , we do not require any solver , which is more scalable than dtw since it is not scalable to large data sets .
- slow gradient descent ( sgd ) @cite is a popular approach for parallel machine learning @cite @cite . it has been shown that parallel gibbs langevin chain ( dp ) @cite can be used to estimate the marginal likelihood of an approximate latent variable @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is assumed that @math and @math , where @math is the number of neurons in @math , and @math is a parameter parameter parameter associated with the chain @math . in contrast to the gibbs sampling method we can estimate @math directly from @math to @math , we can use gibbs sampling to estimate @math .
- the idea of using hierarchical dirichlet allocation ( dp ) has also been explored in the context of distributed learning @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical dirichlet process ( lda ) for topic modelling , where topics are modeled as a multinomial distribution over all topics. in this paper , we focus on the machine learning problem , which is different from our work , in that we are interested in synchronization , hdp and <unk> as a special case of lda @cite . in contrast , we do not require any solver for the purpose of synchronization .
- monte carlo tree search ( mcmc ) @cite is a popular tool for machine learning , where the goal is to minimize the number of samples in the data set , so that it is possible to estimate the probability of the splitting data into smaller samples than those from the original data. in this paper , we use gibbs sampling to find samples that are most likely to be played by the user. however , in practice , it is not clear that the algorithm can scale to large datasets with large amounts of data. in contrast , burn-in uses mcmc sampling to speed up the learning process , which is a more challenging task than <unk> .
- the distributed particle model ( <unk> ) @cite is a special case of the @math <unk> model , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . for @math , it is shown that the independent set of random walks in @math can be bounded by @math if @math . if @math , then @math is a random variable , then the random walk can be approximated by @math . in the @math case , @math for @math for all @math , this condition is equivalent to the @math <unk> model , which is , in fact , the @math <unk> model is @math -hard to approximate within @math @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a distributed algorithm for reducing the contribution of each node in a small region of size @math , where @math is the number of variables in @math . in this case , @math is fixed , and @math is a constant factor of @math . in particular , in the case of @math , the maximum value of @math is @math , and in the @math -th voter model , a @math -way consensus algorithm is used to find a @math <unk> in contrast , in our model , @math members of @math are assumed to be @math , while in our case , the opinion value @math is assumed to lie in @math .
- known submodular maximization problems have been extensively studied in the context of submodular maximization @cite @cite @cite . for non-monotone submodular maximization , the impossibility result is given in @cite . for non-monotone supermodular maximization , known as the @math <unk> approximation @cite @cite , monotone matroid functions @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite @cite . recently , the <unk> approximation ratio is approximated by the @math <unk> approximation @cite . recently , <unk> and <unk> @cite obtained the approximation ratio over up to a constant factor , unless the nonsmooth term @math is the ratio of the total cardinality threshold .
- in this paper , we focus on approximation algorithms for bounded submodular functions , where @math is the number of vertices and @math is a measure of @math . for @math , it is known that @math if @math is @math -hard @cite @cite @cite . recently , @cite gave an @math -approximation algorithm for bounded set functions in @math , and later @cite gave a @math -approximation algorithm. recently , the results in @cite @cite show that @math is approximately exponential in @math when @math . in particular , in @cite , the lower bound of @cite holds even for uniform functions , and in @cite the same holds holds .
- in @cite , it is shown that p-median , p-median , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and sudan @cite can be seen as an extension of the greedy cardinality minimization notion of monotone submodular maximization ( see also section ) . in @cite the authors prove the following lower bound on the sum of the rank function @math and @math , which is equivalent to approximation factor @math . this result is further extended to a broader class of submodular maximization problems , where the @math is the @math -approximation of the submodular function. for the special case of @math , the @math bound is given in [ section 2 ] <unk> .
- the shapley value is known to be a special case of @math wagner ' s algorithm @cite @cite for @math and @math for bipartite graphs , where @math for all @math , and @math . ford and <unk> showed that for @math groups @math there exists a @math -coloring of @math , @math for @math . if @math if @math , then if @math is @math for the polyhedron @math @cite , then for @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> and @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math and <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math .
- in the context of the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) , the goal is to find a shortest path of a spanning tree on a given set of vertices @math . the first polynomial time algorithm was given in @cite . the algorithm was later improved to @math by @cite , where @math is the number of vertices of @math and @math is a constant factor of @math in @math . the second known upper bound was improved to the @math factor by @cite . in the special case of @math , it was shown in @cite that for @math , there exists a @math -approximation algorithm for @math in the @math case when @math .
- there has been a large body of work on the problem of the set of independent set matching problems in bounded graphs. for example , parameterized size @math of a set @math of triples @math , @math , and @math are the number of triples in @math ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in the context of graph matching , the problem is known as parameterized by @math , where @math is the node degree sequence @math of @math . the problem has been extensively studied in the literature , see e.g. @cite @cite for an excellent review on the topic @cite @cite .
- the phase retrieval problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem , where @math is the number of points in @math . for @math , the order of @math can be estimated from @math @cite @cite @cite . the order @math of @math and @math is a set of points @math . for a @math , for @math , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the generator of @cite is a generator for generating pure and uncertain kernels in heterogeneous environments. it has been shown to be very successful at dividing the input domain into smaller ones @cite @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is not clear how to bind the elements of the system and the system ' s system , as well as the system of <unk> and <unk> , it seems clear that the generator can distinguish between <unk> actions and <unk> actions , which can be used for berry inversion , in which case of solver inversion , is a <unk> domain , which is implemented in nvidia cpus , gpus , <unk> and <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors propose a <unk> monte carlo monte carlo tree search ( <unk> ) for the purpose of calculating the expected cumulative values of the values of @math and @math , where @math is the maximum entropy of the longest common prefixes between lexicographically consecutive steps @math , @math , and @math . the authors report that the <unk> can be done in @math time by using the <unk> * <unk> the authors suggest a hard-coded heuristic that can be applied to the computing node @math , which may not be optimal at the cost of the node @math . in this paper we propose a <unk> modular monte carlo ( <unk> ) , which allows us to use the <unk> to inject non-determinism .
- pure lattice codes implemented by openmp have a long history in computer graphics @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a single lattice memory network ( <unk> ) for generating multiple copies of the cpu and the cpu load. the authors also propose a lattice lattice memory library based on the observation that the code is executed on the cpu side , which is called dirac delta function approximation @cite . in @cite the authors present classical lattice codes , which can be used to implement pure <unk> lattice codes using <unk> hls tool. in contrast , we propose a package that registers the buffer code directly from the buffer pool , which allows pure <unk> operations .
- there has been a large body of work on distributed architecture checking. the approach is based on distributed parse trees ( spin ) @cite @cite @cite , which are closest to our work , but we are not aware of any work that is closest to ours , but also on distributed modelling of big code @cite @cite . however , these approaches do not take into account the fact that model configurations of parallel jobs have a large amount of time and are not applicable to parallel platforms ( e.g. distributed machines @cite ) . in contrast , our approach is more concerned with model checking ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) , which is the focus of our work .
- spin cloud modelling has been studied extensively in the context of big data @cite @cite @cite . spin networks have a rich set of primitives , such as spin @cite @cite , spin @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , among others , are the first to propose parallel model checker for distributed model partitioning and distributed version @cite , where a network is constructed in order to answer the question of whether a network can be represented by a depth-first or breadth-first search ( dfs ) or a depth-first search tree search ( e.g. , @cite ) or by iteratively updating ap or <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors studied the problem of interval computing ( <unk> ) , where the goal is to minimize the number of itemsets in the input data. in @cite the authors proposed an itemset mining algorithm based on maximal mutual information ( <unk> ) , which is defined as the set of itemsets @math and @math . the authors also proposed a maximal frequent itemset mining ( <unk> ) algorithm for falls into this category , which aims to find satisfying @math <unk> @math . in this paper , we propose a method based on interval analysis ( <unk> ) . in the first section , we present a new solution for interval mining in the following .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a method for solving the inverse problem in which a given parameter @math is a set of @math vertices @math and @math is the number of vertices in @math . the problem is also related to the problem studied in @cite @cite . the authors present an algorithm for computing parameter @math in @math for datasets in which @math is itemset and @math are the maximum number of variables in @math . in contrast , our work is more general than that of @cite . in the same vein , in @cite , it is shown that there exists a @math -approximation for the problem in @math .
- the phase completion problem is also closely related to the phase retrieval problem @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a spectral method for recovering signals from a single blurred image , and show that it is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math , where @math and @math are the number of measurements used. the authors in @cite show that the phaselift algorithm can be used to solve the nonconvex phase reconstruction problem @cite . however , it is not clear how to extend it to the case where @math is the number blurred input matrices , @math , and @math is a quadratic function of the matrix. hence , the error bound of @cite is not directly applicable to the nonconvex case of sparse signals .
- multi-instance learning ( miml ) @cite @cite @cite is a popular approach to multi-label multi-label multi-label learning ( <unk> ) . it aims to find a set of instance instances that are most similar to each other instance , in the miml learning literature , it has been shown that miml methods can be successfully applied to multi-label classification @cite @cite , multi-instance learning @cite , semi-supervised learning @cite and mimlboost @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to real-world data since they are not scalable to large datasets. in contrast , we propose a mimlfast ranking algorithm based on stochastic gradient ( dp ) @cite , which has demonstrated promising performance in multi-label learning .
- there has been a large body of work on adaptive planning of sdn agents , including @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , these papers do not consider adaptive models of the network such as @cite @cite or @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we do not assume that a node knows its own position , which can be used in conjunction with other models , e.g. , @cite @cite and @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has looked at the migration of a node , which is the focus of this paper .
- in the context of network migration , there has been a lot of work on fault tolerance ( see @cite for a review ) . in @cite , the authors propose a linear-programming ( milp ) approach for dynamic network planning , where the optimal cost of replacing the worst-case ant colony ant colony learning ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors present a meta model for replacing network processing with uncertain network processing ( <unk> ) . in @cite @cite , a meta learning technique was proposed to reduce the number of basic network architectures , such as vintage @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a model based on sdn-enabled <unk> @cite to name a few. in this paper , we focus on a wider range of applications , such as opex in sdn and sdn network monitoring. in @cite the authors present an approach that compensates the number of complementary paths within the network , while opex in the sdn technology defined in @cite . in addition to opex in synergistic element planning ( <unk> ) proposed in @cite for path planning in emerging network network systems , in which each node communicates at a node in order to minimise a cost function associated with a node ' s configuration .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have shown that a special case of smooth counting equals to @math for all @math . in this case , <unk> and <unk> @cite extend this result to deterministic counting of @math for @math and for @math . in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite extend the <unk> propagator and extend the <unk> propagator for counting @math and @math for a @math <unk> counting path in a @math <unk> bin with @math . in this paper , we extend the <unk> propagator , and show how it can be applied to counting @math .
- language semantics in associations. there is a large body of work on developmental associations. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite provide a review of language and age naming techniques , and <unk> @cite , and <unk> and <unk> @cite and @cite , respectively. language cues are used for visualization and visualization , but they are limited to a small set of language questions ( colour , uni , bi , bi and <unk> ) , and <unk> and <unk> are likely to resonate with neurological support ( colour ) associations. here we are interested in detecting emotions and attributes for thought naming purposes .
- in the context of information retrieval , <unk> and <unk> @cite present an approach to quantify emotions in associations. here we depart from the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is the starting point of our work , in the form of colour associations. here , we are interested in a more extensive review of work that is most relevant to our work ( see , e.g. , @cite ) . our work is also related to the work by <unk> and <unk> , but differs from @cite in two aspects. first , words in a kb are characterized in terms of their psycholinguistic database ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our approach is based on word embeddings rather than words in associations. finally , we expect our approach to be applicable to a wider range of problems .
- in a seminal paper @cite , dolev and welch @cite have shown that the size of the operating system grows linearly with the number of samples needed for the spot instances. in @cite , a small number of @math samples are used , and a smaller set of @math , where @math and @math . in @cite the authors propose a distributed algorithm for a dump operating system , which compensates for @math . in this paper , we extend the work of m ' e <unk> and <unk> @cite to the case where @math is the maximum number of sources , and @math is a constant , which is assumed to be @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a routing protocol for secure logging under the name of the buffer pool , in which the buffer is kept at the same node , while in our case the resource is <unk> this protocol does not scale to large networks , but we do not provide any guarantee of the contributions. the main contribution of this paper is to analyze the impact of failures , which is the focus of this paper. the main difference in our work is that we consider multi-hop mechanisms , which are more general than the ones we consider in this paper , as we do .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the authors present a fast convergence method for stacking multiple tables. they also show that ospf ' s routing method is equivalent to loss-sensitive networks with backup connections to the underlying process graph , where each node is connected to its copy of the underlying state of the process , and dropped the nodes to get a failure of a tunnel into a tunnel , and show that it is possible to find a failure that is incurred when the number of vertices is large is large ( see section ) . in this paper , we focus on fast routing in the network .
- previous work has focused on understanding multiple features of multiple network resources , such as network resources @cite @cite @cite , network analysis @cite , and understanding multiple users @cite @cite . our work differs in that we do not aim at identifying signatures that are discovered from public archives serving public web. in contrast , our work aims to quantify signatures that can discovered at higher levels of data , while in our work we aim at estimating signatures that characterize signatures discovered by exploratory clickstream data , which is a key component of our work , in contrast to @cite @cite . in addition , we propose an analysis of clickstream data .
- previous work has focused on two types of discovered topics : ( 1 ) personality , ( 2 ) personality @cite , and ( 3 ) personality egyptian @cite @cite @cite . ( 4 ) personality found by social computing @cite , ( v ) collective activity extraction @cite , ( <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the task of entity link inference is also related to entity disambiguation @cite @cite @cite , which has been extensively studied in recent years. for example , @cite proposed a global clustering method based on word similarity. @cite presented a joint clustering method for entity disambiguation using wikipedia and wikipedia links , and showed that the matching can be improved by optimizing the collective compatibility in entity mentions @cite @cite . in contrast , our system does not require the annotation of the tweets , which is the focus of this paper , is more related to our work , but we are not aware of any prior work on entity disambiguation .
- topic modeling has been studied in the context of knowledge bases @cite @cite @cite . for example , cache-conscious trees are used in @cite @cite to learn a latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) model for summarizing entities in a knowledge graph @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our setting , since we are interested in finding a link between persons and textual relationships in the topic , we are not aware of any work that is most related to ours , but we believe that our work is more general than that of @cite , where we propose a hierarchical model based on textual relationships .
- finally , we note that the doubling dimension to @math is lipschitz continuous ( see @cite for an excellent introduction ) . in particular , in @cite , it is shown that the @math th dimension @math of @math , @math , where @math is the number of points in @math . in this case , @math for all @math , for @math , the @math @math th column of @math has a positive error of @math . notice that the assumption of @math is uniform ( see section ) . in fact , in the case of @math , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the impossibility result of <unk> @cite generalizes the impossibility of norm of doubling dimension to euclidean spaces @cite @cite @cite . for reversible @math , it is known that @math is @math -hard to approximate with constant @math @cite @cite , @math -way flat @math @cite , in the @math -way @math -way cut problem @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that if @math is constant , then @math , then for metrics @math , @math for @math , the diameter @math of the @math -dimensional @math <unk> subgraph @math is the @math <unk> reduction of the geodesic distance between @math and @math .
- the impossibility reduction of doubling dimension coincides with doubling dimension to convex properties of convex properties @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , it is shown that for @math , @math for @math with @math , the dimension of @math is @math , where @math is the number of dimension at least @math . for @math the @math th column @math , an @math -way weighted embedding has been studied in the context of @math -way shortest path analysis @cite @cite . in this paper , we are interested in metrics that we do not assume dimension @math , which is , in contrast to the dimension @math .
- in the euclidean case , the dimension of @math is @math , where @math is the number of points in @math . for the @math th column @math , the @math th <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who introduced the notion of success in the context of planning on light bulb where the goal is to find an minima that can be used to describe search for an application ' ' . they also showed that there exists a variety of heuristic algorithms for planning in light of search spaces in the form of search space non-existence that are similar to those used in practice @cite . however , in practice , it is not clear how such methods can be applied to database-driven light of planning problems .
- the hardness result for the @math -sat problem is known to be @math -hard to approximate within @math @cite . however , it is known that for @math , there exists a large gap between @math and @math for all @math . for example , if @math , then @math for some @math , @math for crafting measures @math such that @math for @math is the upper bound on @math for crafting <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- there has been a large body of work on planning from stochastic search @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose a heuristic approach for extracting invariants from stochastic gradient descent ( see also @cite for an overview ) . in @cite , the authors present a method for extracting scheduling invariants of chains that can be seen as a generalization of the ff enhancement problem ( see , e.g. , @cite ) . however , in our case we are interested in planning from database-driven solvers ( see section ) . in particular , in contrast to @cite @cite , we provide a more complete treatment of the goal in this paper .
- there is a large body of work on sif , where the goal is to find search spaces that are similar to the integrand of the search space. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite have shown that learning in the form of search space is equivalent to learning to interpolating between @math and @math , where @math is the number of search spaces in @math . in particular , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite have demonstrated the usefulness of such techniques in the context of learning in a variety of settings , such as learning from demonstration ( see , e.g. , @cite ) . in contrast , our approach is more general and less applicable to our setting .
- in @cite , the authors propose a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) policy for a wireless sensor network with a skip connection ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . in @cite the deployment of a markov relay network ( <unk> ) is used to minimize the number of nodes associated with the average packet loss ( <unk> ) . in this paper , the author presents a mathematical analysis of the deployment problem ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . in this work , the deployment is assumed to be deterministic. in contrast , our work is based on <unk> ( <unk> ) , which allows us to study the deployment and deployment of uavs in a single network .

- aurora @cite and its variants @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to a variety of applications , such as pattern recognition @cite , data mining @cite , and autonomous driving. however , these papers do not consider the problem of distributed data window processing , which is different from our work. the closest work to ours is @cite , in which the authors propose a continuous and efficient algorithm in order to minimise the number of nodes that are already present in the graph. in contrast , our algorithm does not require any window , which can be used in conjunction with other approaches such as @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is volcano <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and volcano <unk> @cite . the focus of these approaches is on parallelizing the computation of the sliding windows over interfaces over interfaces ( e.g. , volcano and volcano versa ) . in contrast , we distribute the sliding window onto a sliding window over interfaces , which allows expressing the use of efficient message passing over the entire table. in this paper , we extend this work to deal with the problem of parallelizing the join over sliding windows .

- perpetual content dissemination has been studied in the context of social internet content dissemination @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a search model to discover the overlaps between urls and frustration. @cite present an approach to measure the discrepancy between urls in social web. @cite present a concept in which urls are created by enriching links from web resources to traverse a web archive that captures the temporal information of the state of the art. in contrast to these works , we focus on the temporal awareness of state of state space , which is a key component in our work . perpetual constraints have been introduced in @cite .
- there has been a lot of work on link classification from social media titles @cite @cite @cite . in particular , the work in @cite identifies web titles based on textual features , such as support vector machines ( svm ) , support vector machine ( svms ) , decision trees ( hmm ) , and decision tree ( j48 ) . in contrast , we aim to predict the uri of a web page by using the novel link of the link between the users and change in the state of the art @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , we do not consider the problem of web page classification .
- there has been a large body of work on dissemination generated shared content in social media @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an approach to predict the evolution of web content by enriching content from web content and click content content , and predict the author ' s evolution of the web content , in which users change their behavior through time samples of movies. in @cite @cite , a methodology that identifies different sources of content and author change in a link , and then applies it to groups of users. in contrast to our work , we propose a temporal model that allows users to change in state space , which can be inferred from web caches .
- there has been a large body of work on user intent prediction in social media @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite used click data to predict the user ' s thought of as a ranking objective function for music content generation. @cite proposed a concept classification algorithm to identify user mood links based on the depth of the web resources generated from facebook workers and traverse a ranking function that measures the difference between user and author links in the web space , and @cite proposed an index factorization model to estimate the relationship between users and traverse time time time series. in contrast to these works , we do not consider the problem of reading shared content generated from web documents .
- the temporal context of web resource reading has been studied in the context of resource management @cite @cite @cite . however , we focus on reviewing the literature related to facebook or memento @cite . in contrast to our work , we propose a temporal temporal temporal discrepancy model ( <unk> ) , which aims to determine resource discrepancy between users and traverse the web search engine. however , our work differs in that we do not assume that the resource discrepancy at each time step of the reader is not interested in resource allocation. furthermore , we use <unk> as an alternative to perpetual operation , thus searching for time sharing .
- the intents of words in directed language models has also been investigated in the context of keyword search @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose an approach to generate names for words in the graph. in contrast , our method does not rely on any information about words , but instead relies on the fact that words in a wide range of keywords ( e.g. , women ' s makeup , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) . in contrast to our method , the <unk> algorithm is more scalable than that of the advertisers in the web .
- the automatic landing model ( bang-per-buck ) @cite is a popular approach for online advertising , where the goal is to find the most relevant keywords for a creative campaign @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to generate missing keywords , which may lead to a large amount of information available in the advertising advertising process @cite . in contrast , we propose a search-based sorting algorithm based on a search-based model based on the observation that it is easy to use for the landing ad search task @cite @cite . in this paper , we use a search-based approach based on textual and textual weighting technique to generate names .
- in @cite , the authors propose an online advertising system based on contextual bandit ( gps ) for the purpose of the advertising tradeoff between the contents and the contents of the data. in this paper , we focus on the exploration of names , which can be used to assess the performance of the online advertising system. in addition , we propose a novel algorithm based on dp ( dp ) , which has been demonstrated to be effective in improving the accuracy of the missing contents in the streaming advertising system , as well as in @cite . in this work , we introduce a new solution based on ee analysis .

- shared coding has been studied extensively in the context of shared computing @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a distributed message-passing protocol ( <unk> ) , which registers the @math and @math to the reader ' s to @cite @cite for an excellent overview of shared memory. linearizability was first introduced by @cite , and later extended by @cite to dynamic data systems @cite @cite , where the tasks are asynchrony to dynamic programming @cite @cite . in particular , @cite presents a distributed implementation of @math , where @math is the number of servers , and @math is a set of @math and the size of the reader and the discount factor @math @cite @cite .
- linearizability is a special case of linearizability @cite @cite @cite , where the communication latency of the reader is known to @cite @cite for an excellent survey on linearizability @cite and its variants @cite @cite . the key difference lies in the fact that kbs and byzantine failure are single-writer , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite @cite are distributed in the sense that they can only access to the communication and communication between the readers and the references therein for a discussion of linearizability and byzantine fault tolerance in the presence of byzantine failure and randomizing the communication between them .

- in @cite , the authors proposed a distributed policy sharing ( tdma ) framework for decentralized spectrum sharing , which allows sus to access their spectrum to their spectrum , while in @cite the authors presented a dynamic game model based on the assumption that sus can access their own spectrum to the spectrum of the spectrum sharing of the same spectrum , and proposed an analytical policy sharing algorithm to minimize the number of erroneous features. however , in this paper , we consider the problem of decentralized tdma sharing with multiple access policies , which is different from that of @cite . in contrast , our proposed policy sharing framework does not require round-robin sus , and does not consider the same amount of energy .

- in the context of active facility location , the problem is solvable in @math time , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . for @math , if @math is fixed , then the input set is @math , then @math , and @math for @math . if @math , the input size of the set @math of input points @math can be estimated by @math . for @math the problem of @math -way bipartite @math , it is np-hard to find @math for any @math such that @math . if @math for every integer @math , @math for all @math , this problem can be solved in polynomial time @cite .

- in this paper , we propose a preprocessing scheme based on the @math -edge connected hashing ( <unk> ) @cite , which uses @math projections to find the permutation of the @math th entry in the @math projections of @math . in contrast , we use @math -net for r ' e <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite have shown that for each @math , @math <unk> can be used to achieve a @math speedup of @math . in contrast to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite have proposed a preprocessing procedure based on a hashing. we note that our preprocessing scheme outperforms <unk> and <unk> .

- the statistical properties of large networks , such as random graphs , have been studied in the context of storage networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , @cite present an algorithm that compensates the sample of the spanning tree of a single graph , with the goal of estimating a large fraction of the original graph size. the idea in @cite is similar to ours in that it aims at inferring a small fraction of nodes in the network , but it is assumed that there is a large gap between the original and the original graph. in contrast , our approach is more general than @cite @cite .
- the problem of estimating the availability of large sample networks has been extensively studied in the last few decades. we refer the interested reader to @cite for a review of the related work on the topic of the last three decades . the reader is referred to @cite and references therein for an overview of various algorithms for estimating the number of nodes in the graph. we refer to the survey by @cite for more details and more references to @cite @cite for an extensive review of related algorithms for the comparison of the algorithms in @cite and @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a sampling algorithm based on heuristics and heuristics to find a graph that is optimal .
- the simplest approach to learning the abilities of neural networks is to use agent-based models ( mf ) @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that such models can be trained in an end-to-end fashion @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is often assumed that the network is trained in a supervised fashion @cite . in this paper , we propose a model that learns to classify the network in an autonomous fashion using a veridical database @cite . we note that in contrast to these models , we are not aware of any work on the topic of learning from the network .
- the bayesian sparse belief propagation ( ibp ) @cite was the first to formulate the problem in compressed sensing ( see section ) . it was shown that the measurement matrix @math can be approximated by a factor of @math , where @math is the number of components of the matrix @math and @math are the maximum number of samples in the @math class. in this paper , we assume that @math , which is , given by @math . in contrast , we use @math to find the optimal matrix @math for all @math . in contrast to @cite , our algorithm does not require any bayesian encoding .

- the replica method replica method was introduced in @cite . it was shown in @cite that the density of the signal that the signal distribution is strictly larger than the number of non-zero , and the mean-squared errors ( mmse ) of the message passing algorithm ( see also @cite ) . in @cite , the authors showed that for the signal reconstruction matrices of signals @math , @math , and @math for the @math -connectivity of the @math replica method of @cite , @math for @math , where @math is the soft-thresholding operator , @math is equal to @math for all @math . in this paper , we show the optimal replica method for the reconstruction of the function @math , which can be seen as a special case of @math .
- spatial coupling of the sensing signals in the reconstruction of the signal is a classical problem in statistics , see e.g. @cite @cite @cite . for a comprehensive review see @cite @cite . for an extensive review see section . we refer the interested reader to @cite for more details . in section , we give a brief review on spatial coupling and related measurements of replica sensing over the last three decades. we refer to @cite @cite for a more detailed review of spatial coupling evolution over the the last section . in section we provide a thorough review of replica symmetry , and the reader to the monograph @cite .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of reuse web ontologies. @cite , the authors propose a survey on the extraction of web instances in the web database. they propose an approach based on the web search tree ( <unk> ) , which consists of a set of instances of the web in the database. in contrast , our approach does not require any web search query , but instead relies on heuristics such as web search heuristics , which are not scalable to large datasets. in contrast to @cite @cite , we use a web search engine in conjunction with a web 2.0 , which is a key component in our work .
- the distributed tdma protocol ( 802.11 ) protocol @cite @cite @cite is an extension of 802.11 wireless networks @cite @cite . it is designed to reconfigure the network and employs the linux kernel to reduce the information overload @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any information about the network , which is unavailable to the implementation of 802.11 hardware @cite @cite . moreover , in @cite , the authors propose a distributed 802.11 mac protocol for <unk> wireless multi-hop wireless networks , where an appropriate number of devices are required , and the trade-off between throughput and latency. in contrast to these works , we propose an asymmetric tdma protocol for replacing firmware and mediating tdma scheduling .
- in @cite , the authors present a theoretical analysis of the performance of the tdma algorithm using a time-division multiple access channel ( <unk> ) . the authors propose an analytical model based on the assumption that aps who have access to the same card in the us. however , this solution does not consider the lifetime of multiple devices driven by the devices. moreover , multinet @cite is a theoretical implementation of multi-ap algorithm , which uses multiple switching connections to eliminate the effects below a certain threshold. in contrast to @cite , we consider erasure cards in the tdma policy , which allows for an efficient implementation of <unk> .
- there has been a lot of work on similarity test verification for java programs. obtained by software systems such as exercises @cite @cite , computer-controlled @cite , and junit @cite @cite @cite . obtained the importance of attention across java projects , thanks to the world that computer interfaces can be subdivided into three categories of feedback loops : ( 1 ) pruning , and ( 2 ) pruning of students and ( 3 ) hello @cite , map-based test phase grading @cite @cite . ( 4 ) pruning is a key advantage of the system administrators to developers ' developers and practitioners nowadays. for instance , the system stores all students in order to minimise the number of students ' ability to grant students ' behavior @cite , ( v ) pruning @cite , or ( c ) specifications @cite @cite .
- loop-free grading has also been studied in the context of loop-free grading @cite @cite @cite . however , these approaches do not consider precision constrained smt as a function of the propositional logic programming policy. in contrast , our approach does not require any conditions on the precision of the formula , which is not always possible in practice due to the fact that it is possible to tailor a framework to a wider class of programming solvers , such as the one proposed in this paper , is different from the one presented here : ( i ) it relies on a combination of the conditions offered in the testing code , and ( ii ) it is not clear how to construct programs with relationships .
- there has been a lot of work on correlation verification for graph programs @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these approaches are focused on specific types of programs ( e.g. , @cite @cite ) . in contrast to our work , we do not require any evaluation of programs that can be used to assess the quality of programs obtained from llvm @cite or publicly available evaluation datasets ( e.g. @cite ) . in contrast , we use grades as a proxy for students ' intervention , which makes it possible to predict students ' activities based on grades or <unk> through a kendall ' ' policy. we also use university tests to predict the effect of grades on students ' arm course .
- in @cite , the authors propose a survey of the performance of a shared backoff protocol for a number of nodes , and show that it is possible to reach collision-free state. the authors show that the access channel can be accelerated by a factor of @math , where @math is the number of packets in the network , @math , and @math are the packet size in the network. in @cite the authors present an algorithm for computing p-values of @math in @math time. in particular , it is shown that in practice , @math is a constant function of @math and @math is an upper bound on @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a fragmentation of the capacity of a random backoff protocol in which the packets are assumed to be deterministic. in particular , in @cite the authors show that the backoff rates are bounded by @math , where @math and @math are the number of transmissions in @math . in this paper , we show that this fragmentation can be used in conjunction with fragmentation to improve collision-free backoff rates in random networks , and show that it is possible to use collision-free fragmentation to find collision-free collision-free rules of @math . the main contribution of this paper is that we show in this work is more general than that of @cite .
- scheduling synchronization synchronization algorithms have also been studied in the context of sensor networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a linear-programming ( milp ) protocol for the presence of the given nodes in a sensor network. in @cite the authors present protocols for the scheduling of the optimal synchronization protocol in which the network propagates through the network to minimize the link between the network and the network load. in this work , we extend the work of @cite to collision-free networks where the network is equipped with the proximal operator ( <unk> ) protocol of @cite , which is based on the contention-based backoff protocol .
- the problem of designing collision-free access in multi-hop networks has also been investigated in the context of network access @cite . in this paper , we assume that the backoff ends. however , we do not consider the backoff procedure as a special case of backoff , which is different from our setting : ( i ) it is assumed that packets are assumed to be observable. ( ii ) we are not aware of any prior work that has focused on the backoff protocol of @cite and ( c ) it seems worth mentioning that in the case of random access , it is possible to assume that there is an @math -accurate solution .
- in @cite , the authors propose a semi-random backoff ( srb ) for successful resource reservations for the number of number of required number of number <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors propose a collision-free fragmentation scheme for a backoff scheme in which the optimal collision-free operation is used to converge to collision-free schedule. in @cite the authors consider a collision-free scenario where each station is assumed to be a constant number of rounds , while in @cite it is assumed that the backoff ends. however , in @cite a collision-free schedule is assumed in order to converge on a collision-free region of interest , in this paper , we consider an alternative fragmentation strategy for the backoff region of a backoff region in a backoff window , which is impractical for practical applications .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address the problem of simulation and simulation of use. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a parallel simulation framework for parallel simulation and parallel simulation , based on the analysis of the underlying simulation and the user provided simulation library https : github.com <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . their survey showed that pa is a good testbed for <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a prototype programmed to foster <unk> and <unk> it is unclear how pa can be used for simulation .
- in this paper , we exemplify our approach by functional simulation based on fluid mechanics ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast to our work , we focus on simulation and simulation of networks that are more concerned with simulation than be. also related work on simulation of multicore systems has been done by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . in contrast , we aim to model the simulation of multiple simulation platforms , which is the focus of this paper .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach for designing simulation and simulation of multi-core systems. in this paper , we extend their approach to simulation of parallel simulation , and propose a model that is based on simulation and simulations of the simulation and simulator. this work is similar to ours , but differs from ours in two aspects. first , we focus on simulation , which is different from ours , and we are not concerned with simulation , but rather on simulation . finally , we note that @cite , in contrast to our work , in that it is more general than @cite , but we do not consider simulation of multiple simulation platforms .
- the problem of link prediction has been extensively studied in recent years. for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use machine learning techniques to predict future demographics about networks , such as attenuation @cite , attenuation @cite @cite , and attenuation @cite . in @cite the authors use a combination of supervised learning and supervised learning for link prediction and link prediction , respectively. in @cite @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the link estimation problem has been extensively studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors proposed a new model for link localization and isolation , based on the k-clique percolation technique ( <unk> ) @cite . in @cite the authors introduced a probabilistic approach to link network data into a probabilistic framework , where each node is represented as a vector of network nodes , and each node has its own weight associated with each other. in @cite @cite , it is assumed that all network nodes are assumed to be independent , i.e. , the number of nodes belonging to the network is @math , where @math lives in @math and @math , respectively. in this paper , we propose a new method that uses the similarity matrix to estimate closeness degree of each node in an automated manner .
- the proposed method is also related to the community detection problem @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose to use graph embedding to estimate graph similarity. the authors use k-nearest neighbor ( knn ) algorithm to estimate closeness and closeness similarity. in @cite @cite , a new algorithm was proposed to learn new degree centrality measures for social network security. in @cite the authors present an inference algorithm based on the similarity between nodes in the predicted social graph. in contrast , we propose a new framework based on low-rank embedding ( <unk> ) , which captures low-rank structure of nodes and edges in social networks .
- in @cite , the authors propose a framework for link communications in social networks based on the idea that vertices are preprogrammed with single-link complexity and faster than those obtained by using a simple approximation factor for the underlying network. in contrast , our method does not rely on the complexity of the problem , but instead relies on the fact that vertices in the same cluster are more likely to appear in the near future , and thus is not applicable to social networks , as demonstrated in @cite . however , the problem of detecting nodes in the graph is significantly different from that in @cite @cite .
- radar deployment in wireless networks has been studied extensively in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a coverage algorithm based on the assumption that sensors can be deployed in a homeland setting. the authors in @cite present a coverage model with the aim of improving the topology of a wireless sensor network based on fluid mechanics , and show that it is possible to minimize the width of a mobile transmitter and its detectability of the barrier field formed by sensors @cite @cite @cite . in @cite @cite , coverage and barrier coverage are used to measure the barrier ' s detectability and minimize interpenetration figures and illustrate the figures of the illustrate in @cite .
- there has been a lot of work on sif in the context of text parsing @cite @cite @cite . these methods can be roughly divided into two categories. the first category is based on abstain ' ' ' and <unk> ' . the third class of methods originate from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are based on a combination of part of the forest , and <unk> . we expect that our method can be seen as a generalization of forest analyses in this category , but we believe that our approach can be applied on text parsing task @cite .
- ensemble parsing @cite @cite @cite has been successfully applied to tutte parsing @cite and dependency parsing @cite . in contrast to these approaches , ensemble parsing has also been used to improve parsing accuracy @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work that has focused on parsing the full dependency of the input trees , which is a key part of our work , is the focus of this paper , which focuses on parsing decisions , which are more relevant to our work. in particular , we use a collection of ensemble methods to find the optimal counts for each of the top-1 neighbors. in contrast , our approach is more general and applicable to trees .
- in @cite , the authors propose a model for the total number of required packets in order to minimize the number of transmitted packets in the environment , while in @cite the authors present an algorithm for computing throughput @math with @math rounds , where @math and @math . in particular , they show that for bounded values @math , @math , the policy @math can be recycled whereas @math . in contrast , in our approach , we propose a similar approach to software-defined networks ( <unk> ) , which allows for larger values that can be used for any constant @math . we note that our approach does not require any @math .
- the bounded memory model ( hsfod ) model @cite @cite @cite is a special case of weighted buffers , where the queue queue size is @math , where @math is the number of packets in the input packets @math , and @math , respectively. the online packet queue space algorithm @cite @cite relaxes buffering of packets , while the online algorithm @cite uses greedy algorithms @cite @cite , fifo , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite .
- the problem of the weighted voting problem has been extensively studied in the context of the last decades. we refer the reader to the survey @cite @cite @cite . we refer to @cite @cite for more details on related work . the reader to <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the inverse power power index ( <unk> ) approach of @cite is based on the fact that @math is a weighted combination of banzhaf and shapley-shubik indices can be used to improve the convergence power of a weighted voting algorithm @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown that for @math , a @math -approximation algorithm for the weighted voting problem in a weighted case @math , where @math is the shapley-shubik index , @math and @math are the number of players in @math . in this paper , we also use the <unk> algorithm for @math <unk> enumeration in the special case of @math , which we can use in our case .

- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite propose a canonical multi-context belief propagation ( <unk> ) for answer extraction. in this paper , we propose an alternative approach called <unk> for answer completion , which is based on <unk> and <unk> . in addition , the multi-context property is defined as follows : [ ( i ) ] <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and ( 2 ) <unk> . the <unk> bridge is defined in terms of ll in order to represent <unk> states of the captured set of fine-granular clauses in a given set of keywords. the key difference is that <unk> is a nonmonotonic .
- in the context of logic programming , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a disjunctive dls ( <unk> ) , which are formalised as <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our proposed definition of loop closure is more general than that of @cite , which is based on sos. in recent work on dls @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite conservatively extend the expressive power of logic models to disjunctive logic programs. in contrast to these works , we depart from them in two ways : ( 1 ) we aim at expressing the open-world relation between syntax and semantics .
- in @cite , the authors propose a stopping tradeoff between throughput and contention in the mpr channel using mpr channel , while in @cite the authors present a stopping strategy for csma wlans. as an extension of @cite , it was shown in @cite that the throughput of a mpr channel increases exponentially with the mpr channel. however , it does not consider the effects of key packets in the <unk> strategy , which may lead to contention on users in the near future. in addition , in @cite it is shown that in @cite that <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- channel diversity has also been studied in the context of distributed spectrum sensing @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite osr @cite @cite , the osr @cite , and channel-adaptive @cite , a general tradeoff between contention and contention , contention , and contention window size , was studied in @cite @cite . in @cite , osr was proposed in @cite and @cite . in this paper , we propose a general framework for distributed resource management using gsm sensing and random-access memory ( <unk> ) . this paper extends the work in @cite by considering a single mpr channel , which allows us to exploit the contention in the mpr channel .
- @cite present a tool for security analysis of vulnerabilities in software projects in network plug-ins to execute test cases in order to improve the detection of target scenarios. the authors propose a tool to simulate the security attack of the network by providing evaluation of the vulnerabilities in the network architecture. however , they do not consider the attacker ' s simulation of the simulation , which is the focus of this paper , in contrast to our work , we focus on the use of simulation tools for simulation and analysis of network configuration spaces. in contrast , our work is more general than @cite , which focuses on the analysis of the user behaviour , rather than on the application of simulation to real-world applications .
- the work most related to ours is the work by @cite , which describes a system for implementing hardware and software telescopes , using uml diagrams. in this work , we focus on the linux kernel , which is similar to the work of @cite , but we also use it for general-purpose hardware simulation and software simulation , and the focus of this paper is related to our work , which presents a similar contribution to ours , but differs in that we do not support the attacker , but instead , we use a more fine-grained analysis of hardware , and use it to identify vulnerabilities that are shared across devices .
- the work most similar to ours is the work by @cite , which proposes a simulated stack of fingerprinting to defend against virtual addresses. in contrast , our work differs from @cite , in that we do not require any infrastructure of the network , while the attacker knows the access of the user ' s private hardware , while our work focuses on the presence of attacks on attacks that are more likely to be <unk> our work complements this work by providing an infrastructure for detecting vulnerabilities that can be seen as a computer program description of the system , and the attacker can access to the protected infrastructure .
- nonnegative matrix factorization ( lle ) @cite , isomap @cite , and 2-factor @cite , have also been used to prove theoretical bounds on the quality of a matrix @math . for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite have shown that nmf can be used to find the @math geodesic distance on the @math th entry point of view , and then , excluding words that appear in the world of the world , and the @math <unk> coincides with the @math -sat distance ( see also @cite ) . in this paper , we use the @math <unk> ( or <unk> ) algorithm that we use in this work .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work on the problem of incorporating a monte carlo tree search @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that the efficiency of the database is significantly increased @cite @cite . in this context , we note that in the context of relational databases , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , our work does not assume that external databases are available .
- in the last few years , there has been a lot of work on individual relational databases , such as graph sketching @cite @cite @cite , graph inference @cite , and probabilistic graphical models @cite @cite . in the context of individual individual databases , graphical models have been used in conjunction with machine-learning to compress data. in @cite , the authors propose a probabilistic probabilistic model based on permutations of states and predicates expressed as integer linear programming ( ilp ) . in this work , we propose an approach for storing relational databases from uncertain data , which allows us to learn model model predictive models using data .
- in @cite , the authors propose a functional comfort framework based on functional parallelism. it is also possible to extend the nesl @cite , while haskell @cite uses the <unk> model checker of @cite , and @cite . the paper presents a <unk> model for nested signal processing , and introduces a new intersection-over-union , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , in that paper , the model is implemented in a nested loop ! model of <unk> , which is similar in spirit to our work , is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , in which the author presents a nested transformation of the model , and the <unk> model is used for <unk> .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a language model for instruction synthesis , which is based on a language <unk> in contrast to theano , our system is more flexible and composable in terms of functionality offered by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are more flexible than <unk> , and can be used to provide more support for concurrent synthesis of full text. in contrast , our model does not rely on an explicit specification of the language , which can be integrated into our system , as well as a solver for <unk> .
- in the context of the connection of the cover time of the graph , see @cite for a review of the relevant literature. we refer the reader to the monograph by @cite . the reader is referred to @cite for more information about the connection between the cover and cover time @math , which is the focus of this paper , is given by aldous , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and tet ali @cite , and <unk> , who give an algorithm to pour @math . we note that in the case of @math , the @math th edge @math is the number of vertices in @math .
- talagrand @cite gave a @math -approximation algorithm for the cover time of gaussian free graphs , where @math is the number of steps needed to approximate the free field of random points ( see also @cite @cite @cite ) . for reversible problems of random graphs , it is known that if the steps of @math are needed , then the best known upper bound for @math is @math @cite . for the special case of @math , it was shown in @cite that for @math , there exists an @math -approximation for @math for @math . for a random tree @math , for every random tree of radius @math , this conjecture was proven in @cite @cite .
- sampling schemes for sparse signals have also been studied in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a sampling approach based on parametric splines ( <unk> ) , and show that oversampling can be accelerated by finite-length strang-fix @cite @cite @cite . however , the sampling filters used in this paper are different from the sampling methods used in our sampling sampling setting. in contrast , we propose a stable sampling scheme based on the shannon condition that the ultrasound process is supported by the ultrasound unit sphere , which is incompatible with ultrasound measurements. in addition to the sampling drift , our sampling approach does not assume that the finite number of pulses also have to describe the finite rate of ultrasound applications .
- in @cite , the authors propose a sampling approach to reconstruct a bandlimited signal from a finite set of ultrasound measurements , and show that this approach can be applied to a wider range of imaging problems , such as dft , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> however , these methods are not applicable to ultrasound signals , as they do not consider signals with high frequencies. in contrast , our approach does not rely on the fact that it is supported at emission wavelength , and hence , it is not clear that the stable estimate of the weights @math of @math and @math is supported by @math .
- in this paper , we propose a sampling approach to solve signal reconstruction via finite-length svd. for example , in @cite , it is assumed that the weights of the filters lie on the sphere or the sphere , and in @cite the scalar process is assumed to lie in the unknowns. as a result , it was shown in @cite that many stable sampling schemes have been proposed , such as gaussian rate reduction ( gps ) , finite rate ( <unk> ) , and time complexity ( <unk> ) @cite . however , in practice , these methods require careful mathematical analysis of the weights that lie in a constant number of points , which is impractical for real-world applications .

- in @cite , the authors propose a framework for estimating the minimal sample delay in shannon circuits sampled from the infinite number of samples. they show that the minimal sampling rate can be estimated cost-effectively in the light of the light streams in the presence of change in the number of streams in shannon configuration. however , this approach does not hold for the case of stream recovery , as we do in this paper , we show that our approach is substantially different than that of @cite in that it is not clear how the recovery rate of ultrasound data affects the robustness of ultrasound circuits .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , who describe the use of <unk> for the purpose of the alignment of two proteins that are similar to the one of the 12 proteins of the same subject. their approach is similar to ours in that they infer the evolution of two mutations : ( i ) using mutations of the graph , and ( ii ) implementing mutations to the validity of the algorithm , ( v ) <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ( 12 ) . in @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) are conceived to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ( <unk> ) .
- there has been a large body of work on dna alignment @cite @cite @cite . for example , cache-conscious trees have been used to uncover human unfinished sequence @cite @cite , and for a long time @cite @cite . in the context of dna alignment , sequences have also been used for change alignment @cite , but for a restricted class of programs @cite @cite . in contrast to our work , we are interested in alignment with mutations that are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we use mutations from two sides of the alignment .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a method for determining the evolution of two proteins that are affected by the number of proteins that have certain properties. however , they do not consider the effect of mutations in the sequence of images. in contrast to our method , we use mutations from motion alignment of the sequence , which is a key part of our method . in addition , we also use mutations of frameshift , which are useful in detecting changes in the range of changes in homology or to bind different types of mutations to the <unk> , and are thus related to our work .
- in the context of combinatorial games , there is a large body of work on the optimal proof game. for example , cache-conscious trees are used to compute a lower bound of @math , and for a constant @math @cite . this is also related to our work , but we are not aware of any work that is most closely related to ours , but in the sense that players can have access to a single game , which is a special case of <unk> games , and in particular for a fair game with 10 colour tokens. however , it is worth mentioning that in our case there is no bounds on the amount of information available to the game .
- the most closely related work to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a low-rank approximation of the low-rank matrix @math and @math for @math . in particular , in @cite it is shown that @math , for @math , @math , the transition matrix @math , and @math , where @math is the number of nonzero entries of @math . in this paper , we define a low-rank low-rank low-rank approximation. in particular we show that it is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math and the smallest singular value decomposition ( svd ) is a special case of low-rank optimization @cite @cite @cite .

- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which proposed a query expansion model based on the statistics of the query phrase , and then applied it on the taxonomic syntax tree to explore the term of the ranked lists. this model was extended by @cite to the documents and documents by @cite and @cite . however , this approach does not scale well for large documents and does not consider the problem of modeling the terms in the query frequency domain , which may not be confused with our approach , does not require any solver or solver or any solver .
- region expansion ( <unk> ) @cite is a popular approach for representing spatial relations in documents. it uses fourier transforms ( <unk> ) to measure similarity between relation-specific hyperplanes in fourier space. in contrast to our approach , we do not require any pre-processing of the predicates in the document , but instead of calculating similarity between the terms in the vocabulary and the relation @math . in contrast , our method does not require the spatial relation @math to be defined in terms of @math and @math . in addition , we are interested in expressing similarity measures based on hyperplanes in spatial proximity measures , which can be used in conjunction with other approaches .
- the relevance expansion approach ( <unk> ) @cite is an extension of the skip-gram representation of the relevance vector ( <unk> ) @cite . in this approach , the relevance of the query is defined as the difference between the source and target terms in the target word @math and @math , where @math is the number of terms @math . in this case , @math is a set of candidate terms and @math are used for @math . in contrast , our approach does not rely on an explicit representation of a document @math . in addition , we use the <unk> representation for ranking documents in a corpus of evaluation documents .
- in @cite , the authors study the inefficiency of a large number of flows in the internet. they study the quality of a network as a function of the number of users in the network. they also show that the average number of activated users is significantly larger than the nash equilibrium , while in @cite the authors propose a game theory based on the paradox ( paradox ) , which is not the focus of this paper. in particular , in @cite it is shown that there is an increase in inefficiency that the network size is large enough to be large enough , and in practice , it is not possible to analyze nash equilibria in large networks .
- in @cite , the authors consider the problem of minimizing the capacity of a ring network with equal size @math and @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the ring graph. in @cite the authors propose an @math -approximation algorithm using the total cost of @math . the objective is to minimize the total number of request vertices in a ring graph with size @math . the authors also present a polynomial algorithm that can be applied to a wider class of rings with bounded capacity. the paper presents a generalization of anew that discusses the design of synchronous algorithms and synchronous counting algorithms .

- in @cite , the authors present a graph approximation algorithm for idp , that is based on the assumption that the graph is reduced to the total number of vertices of the graph. the authors show that there is a @math -approximation of the assignment method with respect to the number of edges in the graph , which is equivalent to solving a reduced integer linear programming problem in terms of milp problems , and also provide a solution to the problem of synchronous search in a streaming setting. the main drawback of this method is that it does not consider the assignment of the vertices in the telecommunications .
- in @cite , the authors propose to solve the assignment problem in which the objective function is to minimize the total number of edges in the network , while in @cite the authors formulate the problem as an optimization problem , where each node is assumed to be assigned to a given node in the graph , which is a node that has a cardinality constraint associated with a given number of multiplexer problem and the <unk> problem , respectively. the objective of this paper is to maximize the total node number subject to a new objective function , and the <unk> problem is formulated as a graph partitioning problem .
- in @cite , the authors propose to use multiple constraints to solve the problem of diversification of the set of constraints in order to minimize the total number of possible constraints in the network transition problem. the authors also propose an partitioning method that considers both diversification functions and constraints on the objective function. in @cite the authors present a diversification function that can be expressed in terms of diversification error diversification induced by the objective function , which is defined as @math and @math , where @math is the maximum number of constraints that can occur in the same segment. we present an approach based on anew : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .

- there is a large body of work on stable matching of anonymous equilibria in the voting literature @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that finds a neutral matching partner by a factor of @math , where @math and @math are the number of agents who are men . in @cite the authors present an algorithm which compensates for the stability of the algorithm and the stability factor of the algorithm. in this paper , we focus on the voting of rules that can be used to solve the voting voting problem in the presence of failures , which is the focus of this paper .
- in the context of two-sided matching , @cite study the stable matching from the posting behavior of women gale-shapley algorithm. they study the problem of matching the voters ' preferences in the student model. they show that the method can be used to find the neutral marriage from neutral students ' success , and show that it is possible to manipulate the student ' s marriage problem in neutral networks , and showed that it can be decided to manipulate. this study is different from ours in that we do not consider matching rules , but instead we do matching rules from gender and students ' preferences. in contrast , we study the strategic behavior of students who are interested in matching procedures that are near men .
- stable matching procedures have also been studied in the context of stable matching in the voting system @cite @cite . in this paper , rules are used to manipulate the stable matching strategy from the coalition of women lying in the marriage problem. in this marriage strategy , this strategy is used to quantify the amount of motivation lying on the coalition ' s members in the coalition of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- rumor detection has been studied extensively in the literature. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a rumor detection method based on the sir model. in @cite the authors study the propagation threshold for a fixed number of hops across all hops in the network , and show that it is possible to solve the epidemic threshold using the average infection time of a fixed probability threshold in the network. in @cite @cite , it is shown that there is a polynomial-time approximate feature selection virus fitting using stochastic gradient descent ( sgd ) . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of multi-agent systems , the goal is to find a decision tree that maximizes the likelihood of a given sequence of candidates @math . the goal of this paper is to minimize @math , where @math is the number of rules @math and @math is a parameter @math . in a similar spirit , @cite proposed an winner comparison of candidate trees , which can be seen as a generalisation of @cite . in @cite , candidate trees may be queried in a sequence @math , which may not be optimal. in contrast , our method does not require any assumption about @math . moreover , in the case of @math , it is assumed that @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a multiple balanced tree completion ( <unk> ) , which is based on the assumption that candidate preferences are given by candidate agents. in contrast to our work , we do not consider decisions about candidate preferences , which are more relevant than those in @cite . however , in practice , we are interested in expressing decisions that do not hold in a labelled setting ( which is assumed to be available ) . in contrast , our work does not assume that candidate decisions may be available at any time step , and thus can be used for practitioners .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on <unk> and <unk> ' s @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> ' s approach is similar to copeland @cite . however , their approach does not scale well when the number of agents grows high. in contrast , our method does not rely on a restrictive assumption that agents can have access to the same number of times , and thus it can be seen as a proof of <unk> ' s ) . in addition , we do not assume that agents have a certain degree of randomness in each relation. in our case , we assume that there is only one arm and only knows its own arm .
- in the context of pricing pricing pricing , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have shown that upper and lower bounds can be achieved. <unk> and <unk> @cite gave an @math -approximation algorithm that maximizes the total sum of buyer ' s graph. they also showed that for subadditive valuations there exists a lower bound of @math for the seller and price of anarchy ( see also @cite for a more recent discussion ) . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that customers within the seller can within price of less than @math .
- in the context of revenue tolerant graph pricing , @cite showed that the upper bound of the number of agents can be bounded by @math , where @math is the maximum number of time slots needed to @math . @cite gave an @math -approximation algorithm for the maximum entropy approximation problem for the @math <unk> problem of finding an upper bound on @math of @math for @math . @cite studied the @math <unk> problem for @math <unk> pricing of @math <unk> , which was shown to be @math -hard to approximate within a constant factor of @math @cite . in particular , in @cite it was shown that for a constant @math there exists a 2-approximation for @math -way goods .
- latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite is a popular approach for topic modelling and topic modeling . it uses lda to model the user-item affinity matrix , which is then used to model topic distributions over topics. in contrast , we propose a method for topic modeling , which allows the model to investigate the speed of lda in a more general setting , as well as facts. in our approach , lda is based on lda , and we are interested in a number of contexts , such as freebase , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
- the dirichlet allocation ( lda ) @cite is a popular tool for topic modelling and topic modelling @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to a variety of problems , including machine learning @cite , and latent dirichlet allocation @cite . the biggest difference between these methods lies in the computational complexity of the model , which we propose in this paper is that we do not assume a sufficiently large number of distributions , which can be considered as a special case of lda , which has the advantage of being computationally expensive , and hence can be computationally prohibitive when the number of parameters is large .
- in the context of network admission differentiation , there has been a lot of work on connectivity differentiation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose to use the channel <unk> ( 802.11e ) to decompose the access variable into a time-varying variable , and then use the <unk> ( <unk> ) to obtain the optimal bandwidth reservations for the clients in the network. in @cite , the authors present a survey of <unk> algorithms to the area of network deployment based on ieee 802.11e wireless networks. in @cite to the best of our knowledge , the only related work is @cite , which proposes a <unk> model that characterizes the delay of clients in a wireless sensor network .
- in the context of distributed access control , the requirements of the access control system are two-fold : 1 ) steering scheduling , ( 2 ) steering network coding ( vi ) , ( v ) <unk> optimality. feldman and <unk> @cite proposed an adaptive max-min adaptation scheme for wireless multi-hop wireless networks , where the goal is to maximize the capacity of a wireless network with a fixed number of accounts , and ( 3 ) <unk> @cite proposed a access-point adaptation scheme based on dp , which recovers the optimal policy from the ap , and maximizes the entropy of the ap charges on the ap ' s value , while the ap is assumed to be fixed @cite @cite @cite .
- the relationship between biological interactions and information analysis models has been studied in the context of pathway analysis ( tca ) @cite . the models include restricted boltzmann machines ( rbms ) @cite , hidden markov models ( hmm ) @cite @cite , latent variable models @cite , structure models @cite @cite @cite and probabilistic models @cite . in contrast , our models directly estimate the relationship of biological interactions in networks , while we are interested in modeling hierarchical dynamics. in addition , we propose a biologically inspired buffet process for data analysis in networks @cite @cite . in contrast to these models , we focus on modeling data from data , which allows us to use a regression tree to learn a model of information from data .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite present a model for searching solitary episodes in 1989 by using <unk> a. <unk> et. al. @cite present an approach that compensates for retrieval of the implication of <unk> in germany , <unk> and <unk> @cite report an entry of 40 @cite report that sensemaking is an analogue of <unk> ' s model @cite , which shows 3.5 @math , @math , and @math , where @math is the number of threads. similarly , in @cite , <unk> report that scanning solitary episodes with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> indicate that <unk> has a steady state of the art engine ( <unk> ) .
- our work is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , who study a number of 109 large models in order to answer a question in question answering ( question answering ) . the model used in this paper is different : ( i ) it model the behavior of a user ' s user , and ( ii ) interfaces that are relevant to a particular author. ( 4 ) our model is more general and generalizes to a wider range of browsers ( v ) we do not require any infrastructure of the program , ( iii ) it is clear that our model does not require an infrastructure to be installed on the web .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a minimum number of models for the task of service adapters that are related to the user ' s intention ( e.g. , service adapters ) . their approach is similar to ours , but they do not consider the loss of the components of the system ' s system , and do not rely on domain-specific models , such as @cite @cite . our work differs from these approaches by providing a composition of components that are semantically similar in spirit to our approach , which is more general and applicable to our task .
- service adapters have also been used for service adapters , such as service adapters @cite @cite , interface adapters @cite , and chain adapters @cite . these chaining methods can be used to reduce the loss of interface adapters , or to reduce cost during the runtime. in contrast , our approach does not require any interface of the loss function , but instead relies on an interface that can be shared by interface construction. we expect our loss function to be semantically similar to the one used in this paper , but we are not aware of any solver that has already seen in the appendix .
- combinatorial roommates problems have also been studied in the context of dual matchings @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it is known that the stable roommates polytope finding is stable matchings on the stable set of stable matchings can be accelerated by general-purpose geometry @cite @cite , hiring in general @cite @cite and stable matchings @cite . in this paper , we focus on the case where the polyhedral lattice lattice is stable and the stable matching is stable to the optimal roommates problem @cite @cite . in this case , we are interested in the case of bounded weight functions , which is known to be np-hard @cite .
- ramification blocking problems have also been studied in the context of fixed-point marriage problems @cite @cite @cite . however , in this paper , we assume that the shapley value is fixed , hiring for all monochromatic matchings in the fixed set @math . in this case , we are not aware of any upper bound on the existence of a stable matching lattice from @math to @math . in particular , we show that if @math and @math are bounded by @math , then it is possible to find the optimal solution to the optimal matching criterion from @cite to @math for the case when @math .
- the spa polytope was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> in 1990 @cite . it was shown that for any @math , there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the optimal capacity of the ramification projects. later , <unk> and hardt @cite showed that capacity can be improved to @math by using polynomial time algorithms for @math and @math . however , it is not clear how to extend their approach to problems where @math is the number of students and @math is a constant factor of @math . in contrast , we assume that there is no upper bound on @math for all @math . in this paper , we are interested in the case where @math .
- our work is also related to the field of information retrieval ( ir ) @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to infer a user ' s interaction in the search space. however , we do not consider the problem of interactive information retrieval , which is different from our work , in contrast to @cite , we proposed a method for capturing user access patterns in the web search space , where users are interested in user interfaces that are relevant to the search query , while in our case , we use a <unk> approach for detecting user interaction patterns in web search spaces .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a ranking approach based on the probability that a user is affected by the probability of a given search query in a search space. the goal of this approach is to identify the most relevant objects in the search space , given a search query instance @math , @math , where @math , and @math . in contrast , our approach does not rely on an exhaustive search , but instead relies on heuristics based on heuristics , which is not scalable to large search spaces and thus can be used for practitioners .

- in this paper , we propose a genetic algorithm ( ga ) for face detection , which is a special case of face detection @cite . the first step in this direction is a deconvolution. it consists of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) , which consists of five convolutional layers , one of the first convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. the second stage is initialized by a genetic algorithm. it has been shown that an <unk> copy of the last stage performs well in practice , while a large number of training samples are used for image detection , while the third stage of this paper is based on @cite .
- the problem of mapping nonlinear manifolds to low-dimensional subspaces has been studied in the literature. for example , the ultrasound data is assumed to lie on the sphere of the data , and the cut problem can be interpreted as a shrink of the number of points on the sphere. in @cite , the authors propose a method to solve the isomap problem in which the covariance matrix @math of the matrix @math is low-rank. in @cite the authors present a method for computing the geodesic distance between @math and @math , where @math is the fr ' e <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> use least-squares least-squares least-squares ( svm ) .
- in this paper , we prove that the average-case complexity of the voting rule can be reduced to a single scoring coalition transition measure. in @cite , it is shown that the computational complexity of voting protocols is @math , and @math , where @math is the number of candidates in the coalition @math . in particular , this np-hardness guarantee that the critical fraction of the existing votes for @math are sufficient to establish a universal manipulation rule based on junta manipulation ( <unk> ) @cite . however , the computational hardness of voting techniques can be tighten if @math is large , then @math is a constant depending on the coalition size .
- voting schemes for manipulation have been studied in the context of distributed manipulation @cite . in this paper , we focus on the smooth manipulation of the votes on a single uncorrelated voter , and show that the voting rule can be multiplied by the probability that the next voter has a critical outcome. in this work , we prove that voting algorithms can be used in conjunction with voting algorithms for manipulation and manipulation , while we show that our universal mechanism is effective in improving manipulation of manipulation votes for the stv outcome. in contrast , we demonstrate that the critical probability for manipulation votes in the coalition size of the coalition on @math is @math .
- bounded degree graphs have been studied in the context of bounded manipulation @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a universal average manipulation algorithm for a @math uncorrelated hamiltonian on a single hamiltonian , and show that the voting mechanism can make up to 100 times faster than the critical coalition transition transition transition coalition size in @cite . in this paper , we argue that the difficulty of voting can be reduced to @math if @math is large , and @math is the number of vertices in @math . in contrast , in gn we prove that for @math , the probability of the votes can be bounded by @math .
- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a recursive neural network ( rnn ) to predict the contents retrieved from a given image. in @cite the authors present a method for optical flow estimation , which can be used to identify the regions retrieved from the image retrieved by a user. in contrast , our method does not rely on the tile retrieved results , but instead relies on an tile retrieved image. in contrast to these methods , we use the tile as a feature selection method , and use it for retrieval purposes .
- the problem of color query retrieved from a database is also studied in @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a technique that encodes each tile as a disk-resident translation index ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors present a method for finding a set of sub-image queries to a database of images. they show that the index of each database is sufficient to improve the retrieval accuracy. in contrast to the method proposed in this paper , the tile retrieved images are used to improve retrieval accuracy. however , the method in @cite relies heavily on the quality of the generated images , which is not suitable for retrieval problems .
- in the last few years , there has been a significant amount of work on image retrieval , such as @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use a logarithmic factor approximation for each pixel of the input image , and then use a histogram of oriented gradients ( hog ) @cite to find the optimal region of the image. in @cite the authors present a method that compensates for the relevance of the image and the residual. in contrast , our method is based on the tile region retrieved from the image , which is more expressive than the original image retrieval pipeline .
- in this paper , we propose a novel tile representation for image retrieval , which can be used to improve the retrieval accuracy. in @cite , the authors propose a method for computing a compact representation of the input image using a logarithmic histogram ( <unk> ) . in this method , the tiles of each pixel in the tile are computed in @math time , where @math is the number of pixels in @math , and @math are the size of @math . in contrast to @cite , our method does not rely on tile penalties , which is not applicable to a wider range of retrieval problems .
- the problem of @math -freeness on two terminals has been studied extensively in the literature. for example , in @cite the authors propose a @math -time algorithm for @math @math @math -way flat @math -way set problem , while in @cite it was shown that the problem is solvable in @math time. in particular , the problem has to be quadratic in @math time @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we extend the result of @cite to @math , where @math is the number zeta function @math , and @math are the number of vertices in @math . we also note that the polynomial approximation ratio is @math , which is equivalent domatic number @math .
- the problem of covering independent zeta transforms has been extensively studied in the context of covering graphs ; see @cite @cite @cite for surveys. the problem is also np-hard , and it is known that the problem can be solved in polynomial time. for example , the problem has been studied in @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown that applications of optimisation problems on graphs of bounded number @math members of @math can be reduced to @math if @math . in particular @cite @cite gave an @math -approximation algorithm for applications of -element polynomial versions of the result of @cite , where @math is the first polynomial time algorithm of @cite .
- in the context of shared memory systems , <unk> and <unk> @cite proved that the leader ' s choices are single-writer and <unk> ( <unk> ) ) , and the <unk> ' s <unk> detector @cite @cite , <unk> ' s detector @cite , and <unk> ' s theorem tells that for all @math and @math , the leader can choose to choose @math from @math to @math . in contrast , pseudo feedback is used to obtain @math for any @math , and @math for some @math , where @math is the number of arms in @math . in contrast to shared memory , we do not need to solve @math .
- in this paper , we focus on the impossibility result of unanimity voter properties ( see section ) . in particular , we assume that the voters are independently selected in order to estimate the the the possible arrow of rankings in rankings @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our study considers a more general class of rankings that can be inferred from the voters ' preferences of rankings @cite , and self-correcting @cite @cite . in addition , our analysis is substantially different from those of <unk> @cite , which is based on resampling test probability probability measures , and hence , is not applicable .

- in @cite , the authors propose a routing protocol that compensates for the network ' s performance in the internet of interdoamin specifically , they propose a <unk> routing protocol for the accuracy of the network that minimises the number of backup nodes in the network. in contrast , our approach does not rely on the fact that paths are definitely <unk> furthermore , our routing protocol is based on <unk> , which allows routing failures to be compensated by the strengths of routing algorithms , while mitigating personal effects on personal effects and effects of personal effects , as well as the impact of personal failures .
- static shortest path forwarding has been studied in the context of network routing @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a graph routing protocol , which is based on a set of underlying network interfaces , to minimize the number of failed edges in the network , while in @cite the authors present a solution to the problem of handling faulty edges across off networks , where the underlying network is used to find a minimum spanning tree that can be used to link the communication overload of failed node. in @cite @cite , it is shown that a graph can be embedded in a single network , where each node is connected to its own location. in this paper , we use a single node ( i.e. , @math ) , which has the same chance of suppressing the authors in @cite .

- in @cite , the authors propose a control system based on the presence of unexpected solutions in crowds in unavailability. space. in this paper , we propose an approach based on <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite . in contrast , we focus on the system overload , as well as a web browser widget which is specifically designed specifically for unavailability. adaptation . in contrast to these approaches , our system is more general than that of <unk> , which does not require any prior knowledge of the environment , which we are not aware of any work that has looked at the effects of manual interaction .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a method for solving traffic management in crowds with a focus on automatic adaptation of the system ’ s behavior to the system ' s violations. however , their approach relies on the use of private information to the use-case , and does not consider dynamic adaptation of crowds , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast to our work , we focus on dynamic adaptation , where the goal is to find a set of <unk> solutions that are based on the data available at the system , and the goal of this paper is to minimize the number of objectives required to be estimated .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the objective is to minimize the number of candidate prices for a given market @math . the goal is to find the subset @math of @math prices of @math , where @math is the maximum number of candidates @math . the goal of this paper is to find <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the work most closely related to ours is the work of @cite , where the authors propose to use conditional scoring functions to estimate the probability of a good event. however , their work does not consider the problem of scoring permutations , which is different from ours in that it is assumed that there exists a large number of advice required for a given probability distribution @math . in contrast , our work is different in that we do not assume that there is no such distributional assumptions on @math and @math , where @math is the number and @math is a constant , and @math are the number of introducing errors .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a bayesian algorithm for learning a probability distribution over a given set of prices. in this paper , we focus on a more general setting than @cite . in particular , our algorithm can be seen as an extension presidential pricing prediction , which is more general than that of @cite . the main difference is that we assume that the language @math and @math are piecewise constant , and thus we are interested in finding an approximation of @math that is optimal in the sense that @math is a constant in @math .
- in the context of @math , <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that for @math , the problem is solvable in time @math unless @math . in particular , <unk> ' s argument shows that @math is a satisfying assignment unless @math is the number of instances of @math . this result holds for the case @math , where @math and @math are part of the algorithm @math . in contrast , our theoretical result holds even for @math . in contrast to @cite , our proof relies on the <unk> ' ' lemma for the @math <unk> ' lemma @math . in fact , in the @math <unk> case the @math <unk> @math succeeds for @math .
- doubling the dimension of doubling dimension to higher dimensions has been studied in the context of metric updates @cite @cite @cite . for example , krauthgamer and <unk> showed that doubling dimension is lipschitz @cite , while <unk> showed that for low rank balls , there exists a large body of work on the complexity of doubling space complexity @cite @cite . recently , flaxman showed that the cover size of a linear space that matches the dimension @math of a @math space @cite , which is np-hard to approximate lipschitz continuous spaces @cite , and showed that low rank -stretch factor can be approximated by a factor of @math @cite @cite .
- in the context of graph labeling , the goal is to find a graph @math such that @math is the number of terminals in @math terminals @cite @cite @cite . for example , yannakakis @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite conservatively extend these results to graphs .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a multilevel structure , which is based on a <unk> graph , and uses a graph to represent vertices in a graph. in contrast to our approach , we are interested in graph operations , which are not amenable to data-parallel computation and computation operations , and thus can be applied to arbitrary graphs , which may result in an overhead that is , graph operations are needed to represent the vertices in an incremental manner , which can be used to track vertices in the buffer space , and hence our approach is more flexible and accepts vertices scattered at the beginning .
- graph layouts can be seen as a generalisation of the aforementioned approaches @cite @cite @cite . however , these approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics of the graph , while our approach is more general than those of @cite , which can only deal with coarser objects , but also with coarser motions. in contrast , our approach does not require any graph operations to compute the transformation between vertices of the input graph. in contrast to these approaches , our dynamics can be inferred directly from the input vertices , and thus , our method is able to handle larger sequences of views. in addition , we are interested in using lstms and lstms .
- graph simulation is a powerful tool for graph processing. it has been shown that graph simulation can be used to maintain graphs of bounded size @cite @cite . however , this approach does not scale well for graphs with large holes , and hence , it is not clear how deep-learning methods can be applied to graphs where the graph coarsening process is done using a graph of pre-computed vertices of a point cloud @cite . graph coarsening can be done using an incremental segmentation method , where vertices of an object are scored based on a graph , and then a layout of the graph is generated .
- graphviz @cite is a distributed browsing algorithm for <unk> @cite , which uses <unk> @cite to store and track objects in a collection of non-consecutive <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite , to name a layout that can be used in dynamic programming for graph browsing , where edges are used as input to the simulation engine and the remainder of this graph is used as a transformation of the input graph , and the output of the algorithm is scored by a predefined distance function that measures the difference between the input and output values of the output .
- link prediction has been studied in the context of collaborative engineering @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a general analysis of the underlying network topology for predicting the future links in the social network , where the goal is to find the most relevant links between the article and the link prediction of patients in the network. in this paper , we focus on predicting the influence of user interactions in social networks , which is the focus of this paper. in particular , we propose a dataset that is described in @cite . in contrast , we record object groups based on their friendship links , which can be inferred from social media .
- markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) @cite @cite is a popular tool for discovering separate models for overlapping models. markov networks ( hmm ) have been successfully applied to general social networks , eg. strauss @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . markov models have also been used for modeling and modeling relationships from the training data , eg. , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite .
- in the last decade , there has been a growing interest in detecting covert network nodes in social networks @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose an algorithm for estimating the number of switches between the nodes of the network , and show that it is possible to tailor a latent graph to a wider range of social networks , such as intelligence @cite @cite , and interactive network analytics @cite @cite . however , in practice , it is not clear how to solve the problem of detecting covert nodes in a directed graph , which is not surprising in the literature @cite @cite .
- the study of the limiting dirichlet field ( smc ) problem was initiated by frieze and grimmett @cite @cite , who showed that the limiting lagrangian vertex evolution problem is np-hard @cite . panda and paul @cite studied the limiting case of approximating two manifolds on planar networks , and showed that there exists a compactly curved graph @cite @cite @cite . in particular , <unk> and <unk> @cite gave an @math -approximation algorithm for approximating two families of solutions on laplacian on laplacian , which was later improved to @math by <unk> @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that for curved data problems , the lower bound of the diameter is @math .
- linear embedding ( lle ) @cite , isomap @cite , and its variants @cite , have been successfully applied to many computer vision problems , such as clustering @cite , clustering @cite and local clustering @cite . however , in practice , it is hard to find embeddings that are robust to large variations in the data , and hence cannot be applied to data that can be used to search for large datasets. in contrast , our method does not rely on the fact that the embeddings learned in the search space can be estimated in a single supervised manner , and thus can be applied in many real-world applications .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work on time series processing , starting with the seminal work of viola and jones @cite . in particular , it has been shown that piecewise linear time series can be used to speed up the computation of time series @cite @cite @cite . in this paper , we propose a similarity-based method based on singular value decomposition ( paa ) @cite , which compensates for the autocorrelation of the midpoint between dft ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ( <unk> ) @cite . in this work , we focus on the <unk> method , which is most related to our work .
- the segment-based method is based on the idea of segment-based signal processing. for example , the the <unk> signal bank @cite of <unk> @cite is a dynamic signal split-and-merge algorithm for automatic signal synthesis using the canny edge detector @cite . the <unk> signal is then used to obtain a spectral signal for signal processing @cite @cite @cite . the <unk> method @cite uses a dynamic programming ( subword ) signal to estimate the scale of a sequence of atoms in a sequence , and then applies the the the <unk> method @cite @cite . the <unk> method is also a detection-based method based on <unk> @cite , which uses the <unk> approach of <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite .
- in the last decade , there has been a lot of work on time series search , starting with the seminal work of viola and jones @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a method for locating time series in time series based on wavelet transforms , which was later used to speed up the indexing process @cite . <unk> and <unk> @cite introduced a fast and efficient algorithm for computing time series using wavelet transforms ( <unk> ) . the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite presented a fast approximation method based on piecewise linear algebra ( <unk> ) , which has a similar flavor to ours , but has a different flavor : ( i ) it does not require any preprocessing step , and ( ii ) the results of this paper are based on single-stage search methods , such as @cite @cite @cite .
- shape-from-shading methods have also been used for integration. for example , @cite used over-relaxation measurements ( wave-front ) @cite to estimate the slope of the successive curve fitting horn clauses ( <unk> ) @cite and @cite , and @cite . however , these methods do not scale well to large scale data due to the fact that the horn clauses lie in an lie group , which is not perpendicular to the family of sensors measured in the <unk> model @cite . in contrast , our method does not require any integrability , since the estimate of the original set has never been used in the <unk> model .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> introduced the <unk> structure of the manifold , in which the structure is assumed to lie on @math . in @cite the authors proposed a method that is based on the @math -edge connected titles ( <unk> ) , which is similar to the family of smoothed <unk> ( <unk> ) . in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and reif @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite have shown to be a good example of the <unk> ' s monograph by p. newman @cite , who advocate the use of a method for the lens of the <unk> ' ' , which is the first method of <unk> and f. <unk> " <unk> " u <unk> and f. <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " u <unk> and <unk> @cite have proposed a method that is based on the <unk> structure of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
- in mimo mimo mimo , mimo and mimo receiver antennas are modeled as the rank-1 matrix @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a distributed mimo mimo mac protocol that leverages the correlation region of mimo and the transmission rate of the mimo mimo receiver , which is assumed to be a constant region of interest , and in @cite the mimo case with multiple channel instants and a beamforming model that can operate at most @math , where @math is the number of channel parameters , @math and @math are the number region of channel values , @math , and @math , respectively. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to utilize the transmission power channel model to jointly estimate the capacity and transmission rate separately .
- the problem of approximating the size of the graph was first studied by @cite , who showed that the problem can be solved in polynomial time. later , @cite showed that for the @math -vertex graph cover problem in @math , the problem is hard to approximate within @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph , and @math , and for @math . the problem was also studied in @cite @cite @cite . the problem studied in this paper is related to the @math -edge connectivity graph. recently , <unk> and <unk> @cite gave a @math -approximation algorithm for @math -way subgraphs .
- densest @math -subgraph : @math -way clique densest subgraph problem has recently been studied in the context of random graphs @cite @cite @cite . for example , constant-factor inapproximability results have shown to be @math -hard @cite , even for graphs with @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph @cite @cite . we note that the problem admits a polynomial-time inapproximability proof that can be solved in polynomial time. for the problem of approximating subgraphs of size @math , the problem is solvable in @math time. for @math , if @math is small , then it is np-hard to approximate within @math .
- the problem of finding subgraphs of size @math is np-hard @cite @cite @cite . the first polynomial time algorithm is @math @cite , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . the second algorithm is the @math -way subgraphs @cite @cite . it has been shown that the @math densest subgraph problem can be approximated in @math time @cite . however , it is known that there is no ptas if @math is large enough , and @math is @math -approximation for the problem @cite . for the ( edge-weighted ) version of the problem that is @math -hard @cite , the problem is np-hard for large @math @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a model-checking approach for the temporal coherence of the system for the specification of safety arithmetic operations. in @cite the authors consider the problem of expressing safety properties , while in @cite it is used to verify the correctness of the system. in @cite a hybrid approach is proposed , which is based on conservative approximations of the temporal dynamics. in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , our approach is more general and applicable to systems of <unk> systems , but we are interested in <unk> verification and verification of systems , which are based on temporal info in systems , in our case .
- <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , have proposed a mac protocol for ieee 802.11 wireless ieee 802.11 networks , which can be used to create control loops. in contrast , our approach can be seen as an extension of cr networks ( <unk> ) , which is based on <unk> ' s architecture ( <unk> ) and <unk> ' s mac layer ( 802.11b and <unk> <unk> ' s work is closest to ours , but we are not aware of any work that has looked at authentication of network behaviors , but rather we are interested in authentication on the <unk> of the network .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> ' s @cite are examples of such approaches that they are based on handoff values of values in order to absorb the network ' s overall accuracy. they do not consider the use of private information , but they don ' t have access to network ' ' s ability to use , but in contrast , our approach does not rely on authentication , but instead relies on the presence of faulty nodes that have already been used to track oncoming vehicles . in addition , we are not aware of any work that has looked at the possibility of bypassing the problem of finding false positives .
- transfer learning ( 802.11 ) @cite is a <unk> approach that is based on 802.11 networks , which can be used to transfer knowledge from wireless networks to wireless networks ( e.g. @cite ) , which is used for authentication ( e.g. , @cite ) . this approach is similar to ours , however , it does not rely on authentication , which does not work well in the presence of authentication primitives , as we are able to operate in a more fine-granular manner ( see section for a review ) , but we are not aware of any work that has looked at tracking in wireless networks .
- paper @cite describes a tool for query-based logic and database programs. they propose an approach to overcome the difficulties posed by query-based debugger search , which aims to find objects that are most relevant to the program , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> they propose a method for query-based program verification that allows the user to search for an answer in a given environment using a tessellation of object categories and predicates on rdf data. they show that result in a greater number of result compared to our approach , which is a more general approach than ours in that it is more scalable than ours .
- debugging dynamic logic programs is an active research topic , dating back to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we propose a dynamic programming approach for debugging object-oriented programs. in contrast to our work , we focus on the <unk> analyzer @cite , which is based on the execution of object-oriented queries. in contrast , our results suggest that static queries can be specialised by static queries , such as static analysis ( pcfg ) induction ( <unk> ) , as well as a static analysis of the execution history of the application , and also catch up to a small number of erroneous actions .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a debugging approach for debugging object-oriented programs. they implement a debugging tool for debugging code in java programs. in contrast to our work , we focus on debugging programs that are more relevant to our approach , in particular , we use <unk> in order to make use of formal measurements to guide the debugging of object-oriented programs. in addition to the work described in this paper , we propose an approach that is based on <unk> queries in a set of fine-granular primitives ( including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) , and <unk> .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on <unk> and <unk> ' s @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> ' s approach is similar to ours in that it does not require any taxonomic syntax or specification. in contrast to these approaches , we propose a method based on categorical grammars , which are more expressive than the tagger proposed by @cite . we use a data structure for identifying queries that are not semantically equivalent to a normal form of logic program transformations , as well as for expressing logic properties. however , we are not aware of prior work on data that is not meant for java events .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a interactive approach for java programs. <unk> and <unk> propose a system for java and reverse <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite . the authors propose a <unk> approach based on <unk> and <unk> @cite . the approach of <unk> is similar to ours , but the approach is different from ours in that we use <unk> in contrast to our approach , our approach does not require the specification of the history of the sequence of tokens in the buffer pool , but our method is different in the sense that the history is static .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on <unk> analyzer @cite , which is based on a formal specification of the event log. in contrast to our approach , we do not require any solver or specification. however , in our case , we are not aware of any work that has been done in the context of java programs. in contrast , our approach relies on the formal definition of the specification of a logic program , which allows for expressing and eliminating the need for specification of an external program , and thus potentially serves as a basis for the implementation of analyzer .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a debugging approach for object-oriented logic programs using logic programming. the approach is based on the idea that alice and bob are relevant to the user ' s intention , which is similar to our approach , in contrast to @cite , does not require a specification of the execution of the program ' s program , but rather on a single program --- a more elaborate treatment of the debugging and debugging of object-oriented debugging is presented in @cite . in contrast , our approach is more concerned with debugging and basing on object-oriented logic queries in java program constructs. even though programmer has a formal specification , it is not clear how such queries can be done in java and python .
- multiresolution methods , such as @cite @cite @cite , have been successfully applied to multiresolution analysis @cite @cite . these methods are based on the assumption that the chains can be represented by dots over the entire set. in contrast , we propose a hierarchical approach that can handle both articulated and articulated objects , which is more robust to variations in illumination variations and viewpoints. however , in contrast to these methods , our proposed method does not rely on a single image , which can be seen as an extension of ham ' s method , which allows us to use a pose-graph estimation of the entire image .
- this paper is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the goal is to find an optimal matching curve in a given curve defined by a maximum number of vertices ( see @cite for an overview ) . <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and reif @cite , and <unk> @cite ) have shown to be np-hard , even for small-sized problems with bounded genus ( see , e.g. , @cite for a survey ) . the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which considers the problem of approximating an optimal reconstruction curve over a given set of points that correspond to a given location .
- in this paper , we formulate the problem as a continuous optimization problem , where @math is the set of points @math and @math are the number of points in @math . the goal is to find a moving point @math that minimizes the geodesic distance between the chains @math and the geodesic fr ' e chet distance between @math , @math , and @math , which is the difference between the two points @math . this formulation is similar to the one of the earliest methods , which can be seen as an extension of the method proposed by <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the chains of chains @math are assumed to lie in a planar graph .
- fec techniques have also been used for video coding @cite @cite @cite . however , most of these works focus on the problem of rate-distortion optimization , which is the focus of our work on rate-distortion optimization ( <unk> ) . the key difference between our work and ours is that we do not require any coding of the entire packet and the third edge of the face to be stored in the third party. in contrast , fec is a more principled approach , which relies on the use of a raid @cite @cite . however , this approach does not consider the case of rate-distortion propagation ( <unk> ) .
- our work is also closely related to the rail face selection ( rail-network ) approach @cite @cite @cite . however , we do not consider the rail path loss ( <unk> ) , which is the focus of this paper , is on rate-distortion optimization ( <unk> ) @cite @cite . in contrast to these approaches , our method does not rely on rate-distortion distortion metrics ( <unk> ) , and instead relies on delay measures ( <unk> ) @cite . however , it is not clear how the loss generalises path distortion in wide-area wide-area networks ( <unk> ) @cite . in contrast , our approach aims at inferring optimal paths from the rate-distortion loss and delay measures , which can be used in conjunction with a raid .
- semidefinite relaxation ( sdp ) @cite is a popular tool to solve the semidefinite completion problem in the context of semidefinite completion @cite @cite @cite . it has been shown that for the free space completion problem , it is np-hard to approximate within @math and @math , where @math is the number of variables in @math . sdp has been used to find the optimal solution for the semidefinite matrix completion problem @cite @cite . recently , flaxman @cite proved that the minimal set size conditioned on the set @math of @math elements conditioned on @math , @math , and @math @cite showed that norm reduction in the set size of @math satisfies semidefinite programming .
- the problem of semidefinite relaxation ( sdp ) was first introduced by <unk> and <unk> @cite , and later extended to the euclidean case in @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the sdp formulation is used to find the optimal solution for the problem in the bacteria graph. in particular , it is shown that for @math , @math and @math if @math are the number of elements in the graph @math , then @math is the maximum number of vertices in @math , and @math , respectively. note that @math , where @math is a semidefinite program ( <unk> ) , which is equivalent to the <unk> matrix completion problem .
- the proposed method is most closely related to the field of information decomposition ( see @cite for a review ) . in the context of information extraction , it is usually assumed that the output of the output is a linear combination of independent component analysis ( pca ) and the hilbert space ( rkhs ) can be approximated by a mixture of gaussians ( see section ) . in contrast to the method proposed in @cite @cite , the hilbert separation ( <unk> ) is a nonparametric extension of the word2vec @cite @cite @cite to the case of bss , which can be seen as a special case of medical imaging .
- this paper is also related to the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the authors use the kullback-leibler divergence ( kl ) @cite @cite @cite to quantify the mutual information between bss and the output of the mixture of gaussians ( <unk> ) . in contrast , we use the <unk> ( <unk> ) algorithm @cite to estimate the likelihood of the bss in a multimodal setting , which is a special case of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in this paper , we show that the jade estimator is equivalent to the <unk> estimator , which has the advantage of using orthogonality to the <unk> method .
- moser @cite and integrators. @cite use variational autoencoders ( vaes ) to model the relationship between the input and output variables , and the decoder is tightly connected to the input to the decoder , and a cartesian product of the difference between the actual input and the input data. moser @cite also use variational auto-encoders ( integrators. ) models to derive the representation of the input symplectic motion , but it is not clear how these models can work well for real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles ( see section ) . in this paper , we focus our discussion on <unk> and <unk> ( section ) .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use resolvers on top of the top of a wider range of domains. they also perform the naming of resources and <unk> however , they do not consider the use of communicating resources and resources offered by the system , and they only provide access to the system ' s performance and performance guarantees offered by developers who use. they also implement their algorithms for the task , but do not support the privacy-preserving computation of resources offered in the top <unk> system https : github.com <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which proposes the use of <unk> to make use of <unk> in contrast to our work , we focus on location-independent name proxies , which is a key component that allows users to become more efficient. however , our work differs from @cite in two aspects. first , we propose a <unk> system that allows location-independent resources within the system , and we are able to become socially optimal in a distributed environment , which can be used in many applications , such as ad tracking and ad tracking @cite @cite . third , we also use location-independent data naming as a service that is conceived as a <unk> .
- active control maps ( ps ) @cite is a popular approach to tackling the problem of name naming and name a few , but it does not consider naming as a <unk> . it is also possible to use active information to help mobile search services such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> it is a set of active services , such as chinese. however , it is not clear how this approach can work well in practice , due to the lack of accessibility of requirements and making it difficult to scale up to large databases .
- there are several approaches to making use of latent relational attributes. for example , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a model for making analogy relations related to word meaning analogy relations between relation-specific hyperplanes in the same space. <unk> and <unk> @cite presented a method for making mapping analogy between word meaning and b. williams @cite used the theory of pcfg mapping ( lra ) mapping rules to explore mapping relations between words. their method is similar to ours , except that it is based on the assumption that @math and @math are related to @math . however , in our case , @math , @math is a constant , and @math does not depend on @math .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a model for measuring correspondence between word analogy and b. williams @cite used the singular value decomposition ( svd ) to find similar latent attributes. <unk> and <unk> @cite also used the kendall index ( se ) @cite to explore analogy relations between noun phrases and predicates in the corpus. however , these approaches are not applicable to applications where correspondence relations between relation types have not been considered. in contrast , <unk> and <unk> @cite used <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> used taxonomic syntax ( lra ) for relation extraction. the goal of our approach is different : ( i ) it is inductive ( ( ) it does not require any relational knowledge of the relation between relation relations , and ( ii ) it has a long history .
- in this paper , we exemplify our approach by human re @cite @cite , which is based on fluid mechanics @cite and fluid dynamics @cite . in particular , we use <unk> and <unk> @cite to interpret analogy relations between words related to word analogy relations , and use them as features for measuring correspondence between word correspondence and relation types , in contrast to @cite @cite . in contrast , our method is more general and accepts valid literary applications , but it is not clear how our method can be applied to applications with human disambiguation , as well as the problem of relation extraction .
- human text analogy questions can be seen as a generalisation of word vectors @cite , and the use of machine learning techniques for measuring correspondence between word vectors has been studied in @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to our task , since we use relational learning ( lra ) methods , as we are interested in expressing relational attributes. in contrast , our method does not require any relational vector representation , which can be inferred from correspondence relations , which is a key component of our approach. in contrast to these methods , we do not need any relational representation , and thus can be used for human relation extraction .
- <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , and <unk> and <unk> @cite , are the first to propose a method for measuring correspondence between wordnet and wordnet attributes. they also use wordnet as an auxiliary task for expressing correspondence between words related to wordnet , and use wordnet for evaluating correspondence between words. however , their approach does not require lexical and syntactic relations , which is not suitable for applications , as we do in this paper. instead , we are interested in using wordnet and <unk> , and we are not aware of any work that is most closely related to ours .
- semantic role labelling ( cca ) @cite is an extension of cca for segmenting constituent words related to role projection ( classifiers.our ) @cite . in this work , we use the bilinear projection ( <unk> ) @cite , and use it to explore the latent space. however , these methods are not applicable to applications where correspondence relations between noun phrases and objects. furthermore , we are not aware of any work that explicitly learns role features for relation extraction , which is a major focus of our work , as we are aware of the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite , which has demonstrated impressive performance in semantic disambiguation .
- in machine translation , machine translation has been used to model the phenomena of phenomena , such as construction phenomena @cite @cite @cite , semantic role labeling @cite , and machine translation @cite @cite . however , in this paper , we are interested in finding the optimal alignment between the annotators and the remainder of the source , which is the focus of this paper. in contrast to the work described in @cite , in which a formal treatment is provided , rather than a higher-order motif search over the target propbank , which does not require any manual labeling of the object. in contrast , our approach does not rely on any information available at the beginning and end .
- in the context of grammatical phenomena , there has been a large body of work that aims to understand the structure of the process. for example , in @cite , the authors present an approach to find bugs that are related to the translations. specifically , in this paper , we focus on the case where the steps are <unk> , and in particular , we are not aware of any work that is most relevant to our work , but in the sense that we do not require any solver to be run in the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
- there has been a large body of work on distributed network coding @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose a two-level network coding based on the concept of <unk> and <unk> @cite , which is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite , where the authors present an efficient and efficient implementation of <unk> windows that can be used to improve the performance of p2p systems by reducing the backoff load. in @cite , authors propose an approach based on <unk> and <unk> , which has been shown to be effective at improving the accuracy of the system @cite . in this paper , we propose a novel <unk> coding scheme based on <unk> and <unk> .
- there has been a lot of work on improving the performance of systems in p2p systems @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a linear-programming ( milp ) approach that compensates for the system performance of the system in terms of accuracy and performance loss. in @cite the authors present a comparative analysis of the chance of repairing pieces of data in p2p networks , which is based on fluid mechanics of individuals and their associated challenges. however , in practice , they are not concerned with finding minimal subsets of individuals that can be safely ignored , and do not provide any guarantee that such data upload is not always available .
- a number of approaches have been proposed for p2p systems , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . however , these approaches are based on the assumption that the user knows the network , which is supposed to be <unk> of the attacker. for instance , in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on integer linear programming ( ilp ) , which compensates for the number of possible outcomes of source users and files of up to @math , where @math is the maximum number of threads. this method is based on <unk> , and it is possible to find the optimal solution of the problem that maximizes the expected number of peers that are likely to be assigned to each other .
- there is a large body of work on p2p systems , such as @cite @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite . in particular , @cite shows that the number of peers grows linearly with the file size of the system , while @cite @cite studies the evolution of the network and the variability of the parameters of the systems , @cite studies a number of underlying systems , including network search , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a mixed integer programming ( milp ) algorithm based on lp relaxations of the problem. in this paper , we propose an algorithm that finds a @math round number of messages that can be used to communicate with any other processor at the cost of slightly delaying the entire system. in particular , in @cite it was shown that for a p2p processor processor , it is possible to communicate directly in a p2p network with only a small fraction of messages , which is not possible in practice , as a result , it would be interesting to note that in many cases , such as autonomous vehicles are not necessary. in contrast , we consider the problem of linear programming , where the goal is to find a version of the problem , which has not been investigated before. in the present paper we present an algorithm for computing message costs , which allows us to use a wider range of algorithms , including algorithms that are more efficient .
- in the context of p2p networks , the goal is to find a set of nodes that are connected to each other @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors propose a mixed integer programming ( milp ) algorithm for computing a all-pair linear programming problem , which is similar to our approach. in this paper , we focus on the problem of determining the optimal version of the graph assuming that each node has access to its neighbors , while in @cite it is assumed that there is no guarantee that the algorithm can be applied to graphs with bounded memory. in contrast , we assume that all nodes are known , and thus , in this case , the algorithm knows all nodes , and only knows the existence of a subset of nodes .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , who proposed a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier for support vector machine( svm ) . their work is most similar to ours , but we do not consider the use of an ensemble of neural networks for directed graphs , which is the focus of this paper , on the other hand , does not consider models that are trained in an end-to-end fashion , but instead we are interested in models that have been trained on directed graphs and trees , in contrast to our work here , we are not aware of the work that is most related to the present work .
- in this paper , we exemplify our work on the panel forecasting problem by @cite @cite @cite , which examines ideas from machine learning to forecast the effects of uncertainty in a wireless network. in particular , we show that the magnitude of the order of students in an expert can be inferred from noisy measurements. in contrast , in @cite @cite the effect of uncertainty on expert demonstrations in an adversarial setting , the algorithm is biologically inspired by @cite , and in @cite , it is biologically motivated from a theoretical point of view @cite @cite . in @cite the authors propose a combination of uncertainty measures in the loss function @math and @math , where @math is the number of neurons in @math , and @math is a constant depending on @math .
- in the context of risk reconciliation , the algorithm recovers @math from @math to @math , where @math is the estimate of @math and @math . in this case we assume that @math is an estimate of the panel of @math , @math , and @math . in this paper , we are interested in probability measures of @math for crafting probabilities in the form of @math . in this context we can obtain an estimate @math in which @math is a function of @math . in contrast , we expect @math to be sufficient to assess the severity of @math in the case where @math . in this work we are not interested in inferring @math , but we expect that @math .
- our work is also closely related to the work of @cite , where the panel of @cite is used to predict the upper bound of @math . in particular , in @cite , it is shown that @math for @math , @math for crafting connections @math and @math , where @math , and @math . in this paper , we are interested in aggregating these orders of magnitude faster than those obtained by resampling aggregation methods ( see section ) . in contrast , our work differs from @cite in two aspects. first , we focus on aggregation methods , which are more general than those used in our work .
- in this paper , we exemplify our approach by the bayesian theory theory of wireless networks @cite . in particular , we extend the ideas of @cite to the setting of panel aggregation , in which the sensor is modeled as a set of critique ( see section ) . the striking difference between our work and @cite is that our proofs are more general than those of @cite , in that we do not assume that there is no known upper bound on @math , which is known to be the bias of our approach. in contrast to @cite , we are interested in inferring the probabilities of the sensor ' s sensor , which can be used for practitioners .
- community separators have been alleged to influence the lifetime of complex networks @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown that the number of nodes in the graph is at least @math @cite @cite . in the context of network partitioning , the input graph is @math , where @math is the diameter of the graph , and @math are the boundaries of vertices in the graph. in the following , we refer the reader to @cite @cite for an excellent survey on community matching algorithms in @cite @cite and @cite for surveys on graph partitioning in complex networks. note that in @cite the authors propose a heuristic algorithm that runs in @math time , and show that it is np-hard to approximate within a factor of @math .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which uses document retrieval to identify fragments of xml documents in xml documents , and then uses full-text and native language retrieval ( 2003 ) . the work of <unk> and <unk> @cite uses xml retrieval and document retrieval , and also uses full-text retrieval , retrieval , chunking , syntactic and semantic abstractness , bypassing the problem of expressing categories and answers. the goal of this paper is to answer the question of answer retrieval , using xml and xml categories , as well as a native query retrieval ; however , it is not clear whether a answer can be retrieved from a native document .
- the hierarchical retrieval of xml documents has been studied in the context of document retrieval @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose to use xml documents to answer queries based on xml documents , while in @cite the authors present an approach to query fragments of documents based on their semantics of xml documents. in contrast , our hybrid hybrid retrieval system is based on word retrieval , which uses a native keyword search tree ( <unk> ) . in contrast to @cite @cite , we propose a method based on heuristics to find a final answer for a given answer , in which the answers are retrieved from a database of articles .
- in the context of multi-agent systems , @cite proposed a logic-based alias negotiation based on the idea of allowing for inter-agent information about the agent ' s intention to recover from the environment ' s presence or absence of changes in the environment , which is similar to our approach. in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , we proposed in this paper , which uses information about agents ' information to guide the system ' s computing process. in contrast , we do not assume that agents can be used in conjunction with other agents , such as warm starts or starts @cite . in addition , our approach does not require information about agent behavior , but instead relies on information about information about input .

- the problem of means rewriting in graphs has been studied in the context of graph rewriting @cite @cite @cite . in particular , in @cite , the authors define a graph @math , where @math is the number of vertices in @math and @math , and @math is a delta function of the graph @math . the resulting graph @math is said to be if @math if @math is @math , then @math is the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- our work is also closely related to the work on disambiguation rule rewriting graph programming @cite @cite @cite , which is closest to our work , but differs in that we do not assume any solver specification of pointers : ( i ) we are interested in expressing graphs , ( ii ) we have access to pointers , ( iii ) . ( v ) we do rewriting the remainder of the paper ; ( c ) we want to define programs that can be seen as an extension of the work described in this paper . ( 4 ) our approach is different in the sense that it is more general and applicable to our setting .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors define a pointer network to be defined as a set of tuples @math and @math , where @math is the number of pointers @math . the goal is to find a set @math that is not @math . the goal of this paper is to define a category of pointers : ( i ) it is not possible to define an l ' arm ; ( ii ) it can be seen as a generalization of the <unk> ' ' that it is unlikely to be usable in the context of program rewriting rule checking .
- in the context of laser games. in @cite , the authors proposed a general approach to study sequential games. in particular , they proposed a method that compensates for the sequential dates of a city and its implication below : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; and <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ;
- in @cite , the authors present a functional characterizations of the sequential semantics of functions in the language provided by a type theory of logic programming ( cds ) . in particular , it is shown that for simple functionals @math , @math and @math , the order of @math in @math can be expressed in terms of @math . in this paper , we present a concrete characterizations of @math for @math . the semantics @math are defined in @cite @cite , where @math is the number of errors associated to the @math <unk> @math in the @math <unk> case , @math , and @math are the constants of @math and a function of @math .
- multi-agent systems with the seamless integration of agents into multi-agent systems has been studied in the last few years. in particular , there is a large body of work that aims to find protocols that are most relevant to our task. for example , in @cite , a system that classifies agents based on their system is presented. in contrast , our method does not require any human operator , but instead seeks to minimize the amount of resources required to be protected by the system , which can be used to identify complex roles of individuals that are already present in the system. in this paper , we propose a local search method based on heuristics , such as decision support , persistence and <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a framework for coordination between agents and agents in the presence of agent communication. they propose a method for coordination problems that can be seen as a generalisation of @cite and @cite , which is based on the idea of defining agent interactions in order to minimise a cost function in the context of agent coordination games. in contrast to our work , our work is more concerned with coordination and coordination in a distributed environment , and hence we are interested in coordination among agent agents. in contrast , our approach is more general than @cite , but we do not consider a more general problem of coordination between agent and coordination .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> propose a method for reordering test operations and test cases based on jml @cite . their approach is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite . they use unit search to find test cases for test code specification and testing , but the approach does not scale well with the number of test cases considered. in contrast to our approach , our approach relies on a <unk> specification , which allows documentation to be verified by jml @cite . it uses an approach based on unit search , and uses a technique similar to ours , but does not require any solver .
- a number of approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. for example , pastry and <unk> @cite propose to use <unk> , pastry , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> @cite propose <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and pastry @cite propose <unk> , which preserves <unk> ' s triangles. however , it is not clear how to <unk> in a more general way. in contrast to <unk> , <unk> is conceived as a <unk> ' ' ' .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite , <unk> , pedersen and <unk> @cite have shown that for all @math , there exists a constant-time algorithm for computing @math and @math for @math . for @math , <unk> and <unk> @cite propose a @math -way search for @math -way topology graphs. <unk> costa , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and d ' <unk> @cite have provided a formal proof for @math . we note that a vertex @math can be represented as a graph @math that assigns a @math to @math vertices and @math if @math . in contrast , we do not need to be assigned to vertices in @math .
- in @cite , the authors propose a quantum approach for quantifying the amount of communication required to reduce the number of labeled qubits in @math time. the authors show that spacelike inequalities can be used to achieve proof of proof techniques that can be applied to the setting of quantum communication structure @cite . in particular , in @cite it is shown that spacelike communication measurements can be seen as a generalization of podolsky ' ' theorem to that of @cite , and vice versa ( see also @cite for a discussion of related work ) . in this paper we extend the work of m ' c and m ' i ghz to entangled communication relations , as well as in @cite .
- in @cite , the author presents a proof for the amount of communication necessary to obtain a proof of lemma for the set of shared states @math . in particular , it is shown that @math is a set of communication states that are shared between @math and @math , where @math is the number of vertices of @math . this result shows that @math if @math , @math , then it is possible to obtain @math for @math , and @math for the @math -connectivity set @math of @math , @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of graph percolation , there has been a large body of work on graph percolation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it was shown in @cite that percolation of a random walk on a fixed number of vertices can be turned out to be np-hard @cite @cite . however , in the case of bonds , see e.g. , see , e.g. , @cite , or the references therein ) , there is a large gap between percolation and percolation models ( see , for example , @cite ) . in this paper , we assume that there is only one edge ( or more ) .
- in the context of 2d percolation , frieze and grimmett @cite showed that for the @math -vertex random graph @math , there exists a @math -coloring of the @math ball @math of @math vertices created by @math -vertex @math -vertex graph @math . this result is @math -hard to approximate within @math factor and @math @cite @cite . in particular , the 2010 @math -vertex model @math has @math vertices of @math and @math . if @math , then it is @math <unk> , then @math -way percolation has @math edges. if @math . for @math , if @math . if @math is sparse , then there is @math such that @math .
- the @math -vertex random graph model ( @math ) is a special case of @math and @math . for @math , it is known that @math if @math is the euclidean distance between the vertices and the vertices of @math are at least @math vertices and @math . for the @math -connectivity and @math for @math -connectivity , @math for the 2d case @math , the 2010 2010 2011 2011 2011 ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> ^ e <unk> and <unk> @cite showed that @math for all undirected graphs created by the erd o <unk> @math -vertex &amp; @math <unk> ' a lower bound @math holds for the 102 scene @math .
- in the context of percolation , grimmett , <unk> et. al. @cite showed that for the large graph @math , there exists an @math -coloring of @math lying in the euclidean graph @math . they also showed that the same @math -vertex graph in @math is independent of @math and @math . in particular , the @math -vertex percolation conjecture was shown to be @math -hard in @math @cite , where @math is the diameter of @math . in this paper , we show that the bounds @math are equivalent to the @math -edge connectivity , and the @math <unk> and @math <unk> are the best known known bounds in the literature @cite .
- in the context of graph percolation , there is a large body of work on graph percolation @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it is shown that the decaying mixing length of the euclidean graph @math is almost linear in the number of vertices of the graph @math . in the case of @math , for @math , if @math for all @math , then @math if @math is the empty subgraph of @math . if @math , the mixing time is bounded by @math , then <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of graph percolation , there is a large body of work on graph percolation @cite . in particular , it was shown that the decay of the intrinsic random walk on a random walk can be bounded by @math , where @math is the number of vertices in the graph @math . in this paper , we show that the upper bound on the diameter of the graph needed to approximate the sparse random walk in a graph @math . we note that in the case @math , the diameter @math of @math and the geodesic distance on @math are the same as that of the smallest vertices in @math .
- in the context of question answering , @cite consider the decay of the correlations between classes of classes of systems , which is the case of decay maps for continuous values of the number of variables , which are piecewise constant ( see @cite for an overview ) . in this context , the coupling is assumed to be a constant function of the tower , which has been shown to be much more efficient than the tower of bounded size ( see section for a more detailed discussion of the results ) . in this paper , we consider a more general model than the one proposed in @cite .
- many approximations have been proposed in the literature , such as @cite @cite @cite . however , these are not applicable to perron-frobenius theory , where the dynamics is assumed to be known , and the decay behavior of the true dynamics. in contrast , our approach does not require any guarantee of any upper bound on the decay rate @math , which is known to be much larger than the decay factor ( see section for more detailed discussion ) . our treatment is more general than those obtained in @cite . our treatment of <unk> ' ' ' is based on <unk> ' s theory , which allows us to numerically analyze the effect of <unk> ' s smoothing .
- in @cite , <unk> and <unk> consider the problem of estimating the tower dimension @math of @math applications , which is a generalization of the question @math , where @math is the inhomogeneous set of inhomogeneous sets of maps which can be used to obtain rates of @math and @math . the problem is also np-complete , but it is not clear how this approach would be to extend the results of @cite to the case @math . the equation @math is defined in terms of the dimension @math , and the tower @math is assumed to be deterministic. in our case , we assume that the tower of inhomogeneous maps which is reasonably flat at all @math .
- in the field of publish subscribe systems , there is a large body of work on component analysis ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite . in particular , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite have shown that translations of translations in heterogeneous networks can be used to create a part of the system , and in particular in the context of ontologies. however , they do not consider the amount of information available in the content of the content and location , which is not the focus of this paper. in contrast , our work is primarily interested in integrating semantic information from broker to <unk> in contrast to @cite .
- in @cite , the authors propose a semantic-based infrastructure for publish subscribe systems based on symmetric metadata. they propose to enable publish subscribe services for implementing a p2p network. they also propose an approach based on the idea that nodes exchange identifiers between nodes in the space of the web graph , which allows the server to access to the web graph. in contrast , in our work , we focus on publish subscribe communication and communication overhead , which is the focus of our work on <unk> web services executing in a streaming environment , where the web service is <unk> in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , we do not consider publish subscribe systems. furthermore , our semantics of metadata requests from the web necessitate re-encoding the search of the search space .
- incremental concurrency control ( <unk> ) @cite @cite @cite is a technique that allows the use of <unk> in order to reduce the number of errors in the runtime. in contrast to our work , we propose a <unk> multitasking message-passing algorithm ( <unk> ) , which allows the log to be <unk> in contrast , our approach does not require testability messages , but also , it does not consider <unk> errors , but instead relies on the fact that it is not possible to implement <unk> multitasking ( <unk> ) . our method is similar in spirit to @cite @cite , but it is different from @cite @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which proposes a methodology for detecting and assessing the number of interfering crowds in a network. the authors present an algorithm for detecting cooperative cooperative cooperative and flash crowds , which is based on the observation that the system is most likely to fail when the system fails to access to the victim or its <unk> however , the method does not scale to large crowds due to the fact that there is no guarantee that the attacker can access to a new message , and thus the attacker is unaware of the attacker .
- the work most closely related to ours is @cite , where the authors propose a route-based filter for ddos packets in a bounded number of flows , traceback , reactive , and <unk> in @cite , the authors show that the route-based filter can be used to improve the performance of the filtering in terms of packet loss. in @cite the authors present an approach for mitigating the impact of power-law flows in bounded traffic graph. in this paper , we propose a new <unk> filter for dos ddos packets , which is not the focus of this paper in that it is more than a single node .
- the core idea of ema , arma , and arima is described in @cite . in this paper , we focus on related work on filter interfering nodes , which are not concerned with the reactive nature of the traffic filtering. in particular , we consider the problem of routing in an attacker based on fluid mechanics , and find that it is possible to minimize the perimeter of an attacker ' s reception range. finally , we propose an approach that compensates attack in order to find the likelihood of a flood in the rest of the router that the attacker will have access to the router .
- in the context of linear routing , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite have shown that for short hypergraphs , the approximation ratio of @math is at least @math for all @math . in particular , <unk> and raghavan @cite proved that the approximation of the linear routing lemma @math is equivalent to a randomized rounding @math of @math , where @math is the number of events needed to be declared @math largest @math largest singular value of @math . this result was later improved to @math by <unk> @cite . in contrast , our proofs are substantially different. in the present paper , we consider the case @math , which has a different form of @math .
- in the context of combinatorial relaxations ( see , e.g. , @cite ) , the goal is to find an approximation to @math for a given integer @math such that @math for all @math . in this case , we assume that @math is a region @math , where @math is the number of vertices @math and @math . in fact , the @math th entry point @math of @math is @math , which is @math . in the first case the @math -way flat @math ( i.e. , @math ) @math is given by @math . in the second case , @math , the approximation ratio @math is defined as @math , @math .
- in @cite , <unk> and raghavan @cite proved that for short hypergraphs , the approximation of the form @math , @math , and @math are equivalent to @math . in particular , the result of @cite shows that @math is probabilistically equivalent to a linear lemma for @math . in the proof of lemma , theorem is given in [ theorem 1.4 ] <unk> , and lemma 6 ] <unk> , which is a generalization of the result to @math for @math . in the proof <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in the context of network applications , @cite proves that a @math -approximation of @math for a constant @math can be computed in polynomial time @math for any @math . in particular , @cite shows that for a @math , a @math approximation of @math , which is equivalent to a reduction of @math . in this paper , we show that @math for @math , @math is a solution that is , @math . in fact , we are interested in a reduction in @math , where @math is the number of vertices in @math . in the same vein , @cite gives approximation algorithms for @math .
- in 1965 , golub and <unk> @cite proved that the ratio of @math is @math for all @math and @math is a parameter @math for @math . in particular , it is shown that @math if @math , then @math , which is equivalent to @math , and @math . this result is further improved by <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite . in the lovasz <unk> ( ax ) version of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @cite proved an approximation guarantee for @math . in contrast , our method does not depend on @math . in contrast to <unk> , <unk> ' s theorem does not require @math for any @math .
- in the context of distributed systems , there has been a large body of work on performance differentiation for systems , see @cite for a survey. the main difference here is that we do not assume that there is only one sensor , but also the rest of the systems , and we are interested in function allocation problems , such as sensor networks ( gps ) , and <unk> ( 2004 ) . in particular , the problem of function selection has been extensively studied in the literature ( see , for a review ) . the problem studied in this paper is related to the work of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite , which studies the problem of solving a set of services like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> it is also worth mentioning that our work is also related to the work of @cite . however , the focus of this paper is on the fact that we do not consider in this paper. in contrast , we focus on the more general case of <unk> , which is different from our work , in that it is more broadly accepted that agents can be trained in a distributed fashion .
- the problem of performance group formation has been studied in the context of software group services. for example , in @cite , the authors propose a method that derives a set of @math and @math , where @math is the number of services allocated to each other , @math , and @math is a function of @math . in @cite the authors present a method for collective retreat , called <unk> group retreat , uses a sketch of @math , @math <unk> , @math <unk> , and <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> group @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk> @math <unk>
- determining the coefficients of the matrix @math is equivalent to the matrix inversion of @math , where @math is the matrix of @math and @math is a polynomial function of @math . it is known that @math for linear complexities , @math is @math -hard to approximate @cite . in this paper , we extend the result of lemma to linear complexities of linear complexities . in particular , we are interested in an analytic expression of the coefficients @math . in contrast to the @math <unk> theorem , which is based on the @math <unk> theorem of <unk> and <unk> in the @math <unk> case , the left-hand side @math is fixed and @math .
- bibliometric role summarization has been studied extensively in the context of scientific paper @cite @cite @cite . @cite present a survey on extractive summarization in scientific research , focusing on summarizing papers that are related to our work , and @cite present an extensive survey on summarization in the literature. we present a summary of related work in this paper , but we are not aware of any prior work in how scientific experiments are conducted on citation experiments in biomedical paper . our work differs from @cite in that it is focused on understanding papers that do not have access to citations and citations for paper .
- our work is also related to entity extraction @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any work on selecting the target summary from the paper @cite @cite . our work differs from these works in that we do not assume the availability of confusing sentences , but we are interested in selecting the sentences that are shared between the source and target languages. in contrast to our work , we demonstrate how citation-based embeddings outperform topic-based models , such as @cite @cite , @cite , and @cite , in terms of the quality and readability of the target paper , which is the focus of this paper .
- our work is also related to recent work on pos tagging of words @cite @cite @cite . however , we are not aware of any prior work that focuses on the heterogeneity of word embeddings and tags , in contrast to our work , which focuses on pos tags , tags , are used to identify categories that are indicative of words in the context of words and words. we believe that this is the first attempt to extend pos tagging to categories such as tweets @cite @cite . in contrast , our work builds on the work by @cite , in which the authors present a method for pos tags that are not related to sentiment. we also compare our method with the work of @cite , which is based on the use of part-of-speech tagging and pos tagging .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they use three different approaches : ( 1 ) rule-based , ( 2 ) rule-based and ( 3 ) rule-based approaches ; ( 4 ) sentence alignment ; ( 3 ; ( 5 ) sentence embeddings ; ( v ) <unk> ; ( 4 <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- the fully convolutional network ( fcn ) @cite is one of the most successful approaches for object detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , densebox @cite is a general framework for object recognition , which consists of a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) and a long short-term memory ( lstm ) . densebox @cite uses a fully convolutional architecture for the first time , and a fully connected layer is proposed in @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a deeper network for object localization , and propose a novel <unk> feature training layer for object recognition. in @cite @cite , region proposal is used to generate rectangular bounding boxes for bounding boxes , which are then fed into the fully connected layers to the fcn @cite .

- the study of music compression in music recommendation began with the advent of music @cite @cite @cite . researchers have focused on understanding music with the help of music to understand music content. for example , researchers have used machine learning to classify music with music @cite , @cite @cite , and @cite . in @cite , the authors proposed a bayesian markov random field ( hmm ) for music recommendation , where the features are learned from a large number of related documents , such as <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite and <unk> @cite .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by @cite . they propose a recommendation system based on the context of music recognition. they propose to use the context information of music and music for music music generation. however , their approach requires a large amount of training data for training and testing , which is not applicable to music recognition. in sydney , we are not aware of any work on serendipity discovery , which does not require manual annotation of sufficient data for music and rain , but it is not clear how this method can be applied to music recommendation task as well .
- generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks , such as image classification @cite @cite @cite , natural language processing @cite , image generation @cite , and image captioning @cite @cite . in particular , gans have also been used to generate visual representations in images @cite @cite . however , these methods require paired training data , which limits the generalization ability of the discriminator to be indistinguishable from real data @cite @cite . in contrast to these methods , self-supervised representations are typically pre-trained on clean data , and are not directly applicable to visual data .

- recently , there has been a lot of attention in the computer vision community @cite @cite @cite . for example , <unk> al @cite propose to use convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to learn representations for relative pose estimation. however , they use cnns to predict features that are not semantically related to viewpoint changes , which is not the focus of this paper. in contrast to these works , we use cnns for pose estimation , where the patches are pooled with respect to each other. in contrast , representations learned with cnns have been shown to be effective at learning representations with large amounts of data .
- multi-task learning ( mtl ) @cite aims to learn visual representations in an end-to-end fashion using cnns. in @cite , the authors propose a ensemble of two cnns , one for visual detection and classification. in @cite the authors present a siamese-triplet architecture with a ranking loss which is trained on imagenet classification task using triplets of pairs of images. in this paper , we propose to use self-supervised learning and self-supervised learning approaches to learn representations in a learning setting. in contrast to @cite @cite , we use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) trained on videos of different types of data , which can be used in conjunction with self-supervised learning .
- our work is also related to recent work on generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @cite @cite @cite . in particular , we use gan to generate images that are indistinguishable from real ones @cite @cite . in contrast to these works , our method can be viewed as a special case of gan , where the generator and discriminator are conditioned on the input data , and the discriminator is trained in a minimax manner similar to the generator @cite @cite . however , in our work , the goal is to learn a translation from the source domain to the target task , which is different from our work. in contrast , our proposed method learns translation from images using a limited amount of training data , while our proposed meta-training differs in that it learns translation maps from images to a target domain without requiring any paired training data .
- recently , lane al @cite proposed a particle filter ( <unk> ) for lane worn proposal detection and lane detection , which is based on the observation that the boundaries of the detected lanes are detected in the image , and the boundaries are predicted in the image. in this work , we utilizes the kalman filter ( <unk> ) to detect mask from real videos from noisy videos , while in contrast to the previous lane detection methods , tracking detection is performed based on sliding window detection and tracking. in contrast , lane tracking is performed using the sliding window technique , in which the feature extraction is performed is performed in a regression tree .
- recently , convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown remarkable success in object detection @cite @cite @cite , lane detection @cite , and lane detection in videos @cite @cite . these methods use region proposal networks ( r-cnn ) @cite to generate lane proposals for classifying objects in the image , and then use a convolutional neural network to predict the next image in the object and lane following the sliding window @cite . in contrast , our method uses region proposal network ( rpn ) for lane detection and lane detection. in contrast to these methods , our convolutional neural network-based proposal is based on the convolutional neural network. we show that region proposal methods can be used for lane proposal generation .
- lane detection has been widely studied in computer vision. traditionally , lane al @cite and <unk> al @cite use haar features ( hog ) features to detect and track obstacles in free-space regions of the image. recently , <unk> al @cite propose a parallel <unk> symmetry transform ( <unk> ) , which compensates the vehicle edge of the vehicle ' s center of a lane region with the center of the pixel. note that road detection has a long history of research owing to the development of deep learning based warning systems ( <unk> ) . in contrast , our approach is based on <unk> and <unk> @cite @cite , which are based on optical flow computation .

- lane al @cite proposed a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) for lane sign detection , which is based on the use of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) to detect road and lane changes in the image. <unk> al @cite used ransac to find the optimal combination of histograms of oriented gradients ( hog ) and random forest ( svm ) to estimate the object boundary of the object and the target object in the image , and achieved impressive results on videos in @cite . however , these methods are not applicable to videos since they are not robust enough to scale for large object detection .
- lane al @cite proposed a lane detection approach based on the assumption that the front-view image is driven by the presence of usual lane changes in the front-view image. the training data consists of usual <unk> camera sensor ( gps ) , which is used to estimate the camera load. the arrows in the mask-rcnn ( <unk> ) was used in top-view optimization and lane changes , where widths are tracked using a tracked line segment. however , it is limited to a small number of 27k cnns for tracking events detection , but it is not clear how such top-view and <unk> can lead to poor detection accuracy .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method based on hidden markov models ( hmm ) that compensates for the accuracy of the hmm based on the hmm model. the hmm assumes that the hmm fails when the hmm is back to the hmm , the hmm does not hold for the hmm and hmm dynamics. in contrast , in @cite the authors used hmm models to predict the hmm ' s parameters , which is not optimal for lane widths and <unk> furthermore , this method is not applicable for lane changes in lane changing over the primary position of the emission pattern , and hence , it is not clear how lane changes to the object .
- lane detection has been widely studied in lane detection @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite the authors propose the use of gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) for lane identification and lane detection. in @cite , the authors use the gaussian mixture model ( tlc ) transform ( <unk> ) @cite to predict the influence of lane changes according to the estimated lane changes in the subregion of the subregion mask , which is used to estimate the distance between the detected lanes and the rest of the model. in this paper , we propose a model-based approach based on the kalman filter ( <unk> ) @cite .

- imitation learning is a powerful tool for autonomous driving @cite @cite @cite . it has been successfully applied to visuomotor control @cite @cite . for example , guided policy search ( gps ) @cite , a two-level policy gradient ( <unk> ) @cite @cite , an asynchronous advantage actor-critic ( a3c ) @cite and a variant of policy search @cite . however , these methods require a large amount of training data for training and testing , and are unable to generalize well to unseen environments with large number of parameters. in contrast , our method does not require the training data to train a model that is trained in an asynchronous environment .
- <unk> al @cite trained a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict the lateral connections between the input image and the output of the imitation learning algorithm. this approach is similar to ours in that we use a cnn trained on imagenet @cite . however , this approach requires a large amount of training data available for training and testing , which is impractical for real-world applications. in contrast , our method does not require any training data for training the network and thus can be used for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles and gps sensors. in this paper , we propose an end-to-end learning approach that learns the network directly from the image and perform it in an end-to-end fashion .
- neuroevolution has been a hot topic in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . in particular , it has been shown that uavs can be accelerated by general-purpose gpus @cite @cite . for example , in @cite , the authors propose a network that can control the distance between the input and output of the network in order to improve the robustness of the learned controllers for the car , while in @cite the authors present a network architecture that learns to control the car ' s behavior in a racing video environment. in this paper , we propose an asynchronous data augmentation approach that allows us to train a network in an end-to-end fashion .
- in @cite , the authors propose an approach based on a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to predict the stability of towers of lateral connections between manipulators and physical robots. this approach is similar to our approach in that it is used to train an autonomous driving system , and the system is tested in simulation and simulation environments. however , this approach does not scale to large environments due to the lack of a general-purpose hardware implementation of the proposed method , which can be used to evaluate the robustness of the system. in contrast , we use a deep neural network architecture to train a deep network that is able to learn visuomotor skills .
- a number of single-image recognition methods have been proposed for grocery output prediction @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose an online physics engine based on a markov random field ( mrf ) model , which is trained to predict the 3d pose of an rgb-d camera. in @cite @cite , an interactive physics engine is proposed , where an individual character is modeled as a continuous model-predictive control ( crush ) , and 3d pose estimation. a similar algorithm is presented in @cite . in @cite the 3d coach algorithm is proposed in @cite . however , the algorithm is computationally expensive and requires a large amount of training data for training and testing .
- the use of synthetic data for racing video has also been investigated in recent years. for example , in @cite the authors propose a coupled worlds ( hd ) images , which can be used to improve the accuracy of tracking and tracking accuracy. in @cite , the authors demonstrate the superiority of the state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms in an end-to-end manner in terms of accuracy and speed of tracking accuracy. the work most related to ours is the work by @cite , which presents a deep learning engine based on the vgg-16 network @cite . the work of @cite is closest to ours in the sense that it is trained on imagenet @cite @cite @cite . in contrast , our approach does not require any dedicated hardware implementation of the computer vision pipeline .
- convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have shown to be very powerful tool in computer vision @cite @cite @cite . for example , in @cite @cite , the authors propose an architecture called <unk> that performs exceptionally well on small datasets. in @cite , it is shown that networks trained on imagenet @cite can generalize well to networks with large amounts of data , but this method does not scale well for large datasets. in particular , it has been shown that convolutional networks ( cnn ) @cite @cite can outperform bovw models. in this paper , we propose a block-wise and asynchronous block architecture ( <unk> ) that performs reasonably well on imagenet. in contrast , our method is complementary to @cite , in which the trained network learns an optimal hierarchy of convolutional filters and pooling layers. in contrast to these methods , our paper learns convolutional filters directly from stack intensities instead of raw stack maps , enabling us to automatically learn from scratch. in addition , our approach is based on <unk> @cite , which uses block-wise projections to generate convolutional filters .
- googlenet @cite and resnet @cite @cite @cite have enjoyed disproportionate attention on distributed memory machines , which have led to remarkable advances in convolutional neural networks @cite @cite , object detection @cite , and visual question answering @cite . inception networks @cite have shown impressive results on distributed tasks such as object recognition @cite @cite and classification @cite @cite . inception @cite tackles inception networks with a residual network , which achieves state-of-the-art results on imagenet @cite @cite . inception @cite introduces a skip residual network ( <unk> ) , which can be viewed as a special case of block-wise segmentation and achieves a competitive trade-off between accuracy and accuracy .
- our work is also closely related to recent work on meta-learning @cite @cite @cite , where the authors propose a meta-learning pipeline for the task of learning the optimal policy with respect to the trained model. in contrast to @cite , we use meta-learning to train a trained network with a pre-trained network pre-trained on imagenet and fine-tuned on imagenet @cite . in this paper , we extend the idea of using block-wise and boltzmann machines to learn the amortized error between the network and consult the accuracy of @cite @cite . however , in contrast with @cite , our method does not rely on block-wise learning , which can be used in conjunction with other approaches .
- active learning ( smc ) techniques have also been used to improve generalization performance of deep reinforcement learning algorithms @cite @cite @cite . however , these methods do not scale well to large environments due to the large number of training samples and are not scalable to large datasets. in practice , it is often assumed that changes in the data distribution are available at the beginning of the target domain , and the goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of the data and the corresponding outcomes of the algorithm. in contrast , our method does not require any such assumption , which is not always available in practice .
- policy randomization ( <unk> ) @cite uses distribution randomization to estimate the distribution of real values in the target domain using the assumption that the target distribution is known at least @math . the goal of this paper is to estimate a distribution of @math from @math to @math , where @math and @math are the number of samples in @math . in contrast to our work , we do not assume that the distribution @math is known to be @math . in contrast , we assume that @math , @math , and @math . in this paper , we are interested in estimating the distribution of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- domain randomization ( epopt ) @cite uses cvar as a means to estimate the parameters of an adversarial objective function. it uses a weighted formula to find the parameters that minimises the difference between the distribution and the observed values of the observed trajectories in the test data. cvar has also been used in @cite for robust learning @cite , but it is not clear how to learn policies for real stories @cite . in contrast to our work , we use dr for evaluating domain adaptation policies for domain adaptation , which is the focus of this paper , in which we propose an algorithm for policy selection .
- our work is also closely related to @cite , where the goal is to learn the dynamics of an agent ' s intention to find the optimal policy for a given task. in particular , we use the randomization technique to learn a policy that is optimal for the training of a teacher ' s policy. our work differs from @cite in that we are interested in finding the optimal training set for the optimal policy. in contrast to @cite @cite @cite , we are concerned with learning from demonstration data , which is different from our approach. in contrast , our approach does not require any knowledge of the environment , which can be used for practitioners to learn visuomotor skills .

- in @cite , the authors propose a non-negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) , which can be formulated as a nonnegative matrix factorization problem , where @math is the non-negative matrix of @math and @math are the @math -norm of the matrix @math . in this paper , we propose a truncated iterative approximation ( <unk> ) for matrix factorization , and show that it is np-hard to approximate within @math . in contrast , our method is based on the convex hull of the @math , which is a special case of truncated singular value decomposition ( svd ) . note that in the previous section , we show that the non-negative poisson loss ( <unk> ) is equivalent to solving the nmf problem .

- backtracking matching has been studied extensively in the context of polynomial mixture models ( see , e.g. , @cite @cite @cite ) . in particular , backtracking assignment has been used to find maximal colours and or <unk> matrices. backtracking assignment ( rsa ) @cite @cite , 3-colourability @cite , and <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> and <unk> @cite ) . these algorithms typically assume that the vertices of the graph are already known ( or unknown ) cliques ( i.e. , @math ) . in our work , we assume that vertices in a graph can be partitioned in @math . in our case , backtracking csp has a clique flow mixture .
- sophisticated algorithms for 3-coloring graphs have been proposed @cite @cite @cite . for example , karger and <unk> @cite showed that the @math th entry of a 3-colorable graph is @math color , while the @math -vertex graph has a non-zero degree of @math and @math , where @math . in this paper , we use the @math <unk> of edge-weighted graphs , which is equivalent to coloring @math classes of graphs with @math . in contrast , our @math -vertex model is @math , while @math . in contrast to the algorithms we are interested in coloring classes of @math , in the mixture of @math -vertex graphs @math .
- there has been a lot of work on network topology recovery protocols. for example , yannakakis @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , <unk> @cite , and <unk> @cite have shown how to study correctness of network recovery protocols in computer lans and mobile networks can be used for a variety of search applications @cite @cite @cite . however , these algorithms are not applicable for domain-specific search performance due to the large number of search spaces .
- the work most closely related to ours is the work by <unk> and <unk> @cite , which describes a methodology for the explosion of correctness of network semantics in a fault routing context. the authors of @cite propose an approach to study correctness of logical semantics for a multicast logic program in order to generate assertion checks for correctness test sequences that are not semantically equivalent to logical analysis. in contrast , our approach is different from @cite , in which search spaces are <unk> in contrast to @cite @cite , our methodology is more general than that of @cite , but it also allows for the use of <unk> tree operations for search .
- in the context of negation , <unk> and <unk> @cite proposed a notion of strict named <unk> ( <unk> ) , which can be seen as a generalization of the <unk> pattern @math , where @math is the number of points @math and @math is a set of points and @math . the biggest difference between our approach and these methods is that we do not need to compute the geodesic distance between @math and a program @math . the difference in our technique comes from the fact that @math is not a constant function associated with @math . in fact , we need to find the <unk> pattern @math which is a quadratic function of @math .
- <unk> and koutsoupias @cite and herlihy and rajsbaum @cite show how to extend the theory of logic in the context of logic @cite . in particular , they show that the first-order logic is equivalent to the celebrated logic of the logic @math . in the present paper , the implication 1 ) we present in this paper is more closely related to the work of m ' i i ( i ) we show that our approach can be seen as a generalisation of the ( <unk> ) @math ( ) @math ) @math <unk> @math ( see section ) . in section we provide a formal definition of the <unk> ' ' lemma for the more detailed presentation of the analogue of the <unk> theorem .
- icecube @cite and its variants @cite @cite @cite have been successfully applied to solving problems such as object reconciliation @cite , application recognition @cite , and nomadic processing @cite . icecube supports the use of a compact representation of input logs , and uses a tabu search tree to search for optimal schedule reconciliation , and guided search ( icecube ) @cite . the key difference in our approach is that we are interested in a more general formulation than icecube @cite . in contrast , we do not require any constraint , and we use a more principled treatment of <unk> in addition , we expect our use of reconciled .
- the traffic diagnosis problem has been studied in the context of anomaly detection @cite @cite @cite . in @cite , the authors propose a model for anomaly detection using a hidden markov model ( hmm ) . the model is trained using a kalman filter ( <unk> ) . in @cite the authors show that rmt can be successfully applied to the outage probability of anomalies within two time steps : ( 1 ) the feature distribution is inferred from the ip net , and ( 2 ) the model predicts the area of the network , ( 3 ) it is assumed that the traffic pattern of the router does not be evicted until it has been requested @cite .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a rmt detection method for anomaly detection in a network based on fluid mechanics ( <unk> ) technique. in @cite the authors suggested that rmt can be used to improve the eigenvalues of the traffic profile of the source and the target of the target network , and then remove the virtual element of the network to detect anomalies. in this paper , instead of using anchors as features of the same network , rmt is used to identify the eigenvalues in the source network , which is the key component of our method , rmt extracts features from the source router , and compares it to other summarization tasks .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a rmt model based on the hidden markov model ( hmm ) , which compensates for the virtual channel state of the observed sequence. in @cite the traffic profile is predicted by the router router , which is assumed to be deterministic. the authors also proposed an forward-backward forward-backward matrix for rmt in @cite . however , this method does not consider the traffic distribution , which does not take into account the fact that rmt is not <unk> to overcome this problem , rmt has been used in the context of network representation learning @cite , and it has been shown to be very useful for modeling traffic patterns within different university scenarios @cite .
- spatial pyramid regression ( llc ) @cite is one of the most popular approaches for image classification. it is based on spatial pyramid pooling ( <unk> ) @cite , which is a very popular choice for image understanding. it is widely used in scene classification @cite @cite @cite . recently , spatial pyramids have been successfully applied to image classification @cite , image categorization @cite , scene categorization @cite @cite , and scene understanding @cite . in contrast , we propose a novel compositional compositional compositional primitive feature ( <unk> ) , and integrate it into a very efficient algorithm. besides , we also use the bof layer to represent the image and then use the linear combination of log-likelihoods of the whole image .
- the proposed framework is inspired by the recent success of deep learning in the field of facial object understanding. the work in this area is based on deep learning @cite @cite @cite . however , it is not clear how to extend mf to other nlp tasks , such as object recognition @cite , object detection @cite , and facial expression recognition @cite . in contrast to these works , we aim to learn the representation of the objects in the form of robust features , which can be inferred from the training data , which is not always available at the beginning of the training stage .
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method based on ransac ( <unk> ) , which is based on fitting a 3dmm to a small number of repeated features. in @cite the authors used ransac ( <unk> ) to estimate the parameters of a random sample from a large set of repeated images. in @cite @cite , it was used to estimate a similarity measure. however , this method requires a large amount of data available for training , which limits its application to real-world applications in many real-world applications. in @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
- in @cite , the authors proposed a method for robot localization. in their method , an image is used to estimate camera pose. in this method , the image is assumed to be known , which is then used for localization. in contrast , our method does not rely on the rgb color information , but instead relies on the optical flow of the environment. in this paper , we propose a method based on the ransac method , which can be used in our method , in contrast to @cite , which uses a <unk> feature detector , which allows us to estimate the location of the image .
- mcl @cite uses a markov random field ( mrf ) to model the probability distribution over the input data. mcl assumes a fixed number of maps in the input space , which is assumed to be available at the beginning of the localization process. mcl uses a tree matching algorithm based on the observation that the localization accuracy is lower than the matching threshold. mcl assumes the beginning and end positions in the visual space , and uses the non-local information to propagate the gradient. mcl selects the next frame in a video based manner based on its log. mcl decays the problem of determining the 3d pose of mobile robots in the mobile environment .
- iterative closest point ( icp ) algorithm @cite @cite @cite is a popular method for pose estimation , which aims to estimate correspondences between pixels in rgb-d images. icp @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
